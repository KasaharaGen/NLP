Q: Sync Mail app tasks with Gmail/Google Apps Is it possible to sync Mail.app tasks with Gmail / Google Apps so they appear either in Tasks or as email messages?

A: BusySync might do what you want. The price is preposterously high though.  

A: Since the tasks appear in iCal, you can configure iCal to sync with Google's servers. Google provides a comprehensive set up guide for syncing its services on Mac, for Calendar, Address Book and Gmail. The set-up guide for iCal can be found here.
