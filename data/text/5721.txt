Q: How to turn off animation while navigating browser's history Is there is any way to turn off animation while navigating through pages in safari (using one finger  swipe left/right gesture)?
I know, that it is a subtle different thing comparing to what we've accustomed to call navigation, since clicking back/forward history buttons works as expected. 
But as for me, it is really annoying, eye straining and time consuming - to see animation each time you use mouse gestures to navigate. 

A: You could simply disable scroll-to-navigate in the mouse/trackpad preferences, and instead use the two-finger swipe (or three, on a trackpad).
