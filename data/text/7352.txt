Q: Show text in large type on the screen via terminal I can put large text on the center of my screen with certain apps, such as Address Book (click on a phone number and choose "Show in Large Type") or using Quicksilver (type some text and choose the "Large Type" action). 
Is there any way I can invoke this functionality from the terminal, to show arbitrary large text by writing, say, Applescript or a bash script? 

A: Since you already have QuickSilver installed:
osascript -e 'tell application "Quicksilver" to show large type "your text here"'

You can use this to define a bash function (and put somewhere like ~/.profile):
function big {
        osascript -e "tell application \"Quicksilver\" to show large type \"$1\""
}

Then you can invoke it with arbitrary strings by doing
$ big "This will cause large text to appear"
