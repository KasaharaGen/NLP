Q: How can I hide my top menu bar on Mac OS X? I need to temporarily (5 min) hide my top menu bar. Is there a glitch, or something that will let me do that?

A: You have a few choices.


*

*MenuFela, site down, claims to do this.

*MegaZoomer claims to zoom an app and hide the menu bar. Not sure if this will work, for example, with the Finder.

*MenuShade does a so-so job. Hidden menu, but the shadow is there and the space is not usable

*According to this hint you can edit the plist of the app and have the menu bar become hidden. Add the following to the Info.plist in the app bundle:



<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>
<integer>4</integer>
