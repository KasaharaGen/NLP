Q: Does a Mini-DVI to DVI cable exist that's more than 6 inches long? I have a plastic MacBook that I like to use both on the go and at home, where I have a monitor, keyboard/mouse, speakers, etc that I hook up to use it more or less as a desktop. This works great, for the most part, except for the adaptor - it's constantly getting snagged on my desk due to the sheer size of the DVI-DVI connection.
I've tried looking online for a 3 foot Mini-DVI to DVI cable so that I can eliminate this bulk, but without success. It seems that both Apple and a number of third parties are more than willing to sell adaptors for the Mini-DVI, but none sell actual cables.
Have I missed something in my search? Or do manufacturers simply not produce the product I describe? If the latter, is it due to restrictions on using the Mini-DVI connector, a technical problem that requires the adaptor to be no longer than 6 or so inches, or perceived lack of demand?

A: I think the idea would be to use the Mini-DVI to DVI adapter at one end of a DVI to DVI cable.
The specs should be checked for maximum workable length (example)

A: Monoprice is usually the best bet for cables and they don't see to have anything.  May just not be popular enough yet.

A: Here's a 3 ft one on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-32AWG-Mini-DisplayPort-Cable/dp/B0034X9380
Although, I couldn't find it on the Monoprice website.
