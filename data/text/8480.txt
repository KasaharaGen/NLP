Q: Command line utility to create screenshot Is there some command line utility to create a screenshot of the my screen and store it as png? (Preferably one in the system, without need to install anything new)

A: It sounds like you're looking for the command screencapture, which, according to its man page, is to "capture images from the screen and save them to a file or the clipboard".
It's been a standard part of OS X since 10.2.
