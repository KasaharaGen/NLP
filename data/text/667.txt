Q: iHome Mouse drivers for OS X I have an iHome wireless 5 button laser mouse model iH-M130ZR and I can't find any drivers to be able to program the buttons. By default, left/right/scroll clicks work, but I can't get any response from the other buttons. Does anyone know of a program or drivers that will let me take advantage of these other buttons? Even to just be able to use the side buttons for back/forward in browsing would be great. 

A: I haven't tried it myself, but I've heard good things about USB Overdrive. While the name of the utility implies that it's USB-only, it also works for devices connected via Bluetooth.
Another possible option is SteerMouse.
