Q: Automatically move files when inserting SD card? Is there a way to detect the insertion of an SD card so it would be possible to automatically move specific files (photos in subdirectory) to another location? I do not want a photo application to take control.
Even better, when I put the card in, I get asked whether to move the files.
I would like the files to be moved directly to a shared folder..

A: From this question on SuperUser, try MarcoPolo
Or, you could use folder actions.
From this tutorial:

  
*
  
*Go to File > Save As Plug-in.
  
*Choose Folder Action from the pop-up menu.
  
*In the Attach to Folder pop-up, select Otherâ€¦
  
*In the resultant open dialog, hit cmnd-shift-g. This will bring up a small sheet labeled Go to the folder:.
  
*In this sheet, type /Volumes/, and hit the Go button, then hit Open.
  
*Hit the Save button in the Plug-in sheet.
