Q: What Does A "There is a user sharing this computer..." Window Mean? I was trying to turn off my Macbook Pro and suddenly got this message. As far as I know, there's no reason why this should be happening. Anyone want to fill me in on some possibilities?


A: Apparently, you've enabled File Sharing in the Sharing section of System Preferences. Someone on your network has connected to your computer, either as a registered user or as a guest. 
Unless this kind of access is absolutely required, it's good security practice to disable both File Sharing and the Guest user in System Preferences -> Sharing and System Preferences -> Accounts and Groups, respectively.
