Q: Set my default address for auto-fill? Since updating to 10.7.2, the email addresses in my address book card seem to have re-prioritized themselves. Now when I use Auto-Fill, the wrong address pops up, and I don't see any way to change it.
Can I set a "primary" or default address in Address Book? (I still hate this new version of Address Book by the way.)
Or, can I select which address is used in auto-fill in Safari?

A: I had the same problem.  I went into address book and put my desired address as the first one on my card.  It worked.

A: what worked for me was to make sure the address I wanted to use for Autofill was the top address in my Contacts entry. 

A: Select or make the contact you to use as your autofill then go to card menu and select "make this my card"  I hope this helps!
