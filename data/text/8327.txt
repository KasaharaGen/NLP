Q: Which alternatives to Microsoft Excel are there for MacOS X and what are their (dis)advantages? I'm still working with Office:mac:2004 on my MacBook 13" (2,16 GHz, 3 GB RAM, MacOS X 10.6.8) and it is quite slow in Loading the applications, so I avoid working with it if I can.
What are alternatives to MS Excel which have at least the following features:


*

*filtering of tables

*creating complex formulae
(if possible also a programming language like VBA to create custom commands and formulae)

*cell format change automatically dependent on cell value


(Free applications would be welcome)
Would the most recent version of MS Office perform better on my (quite old) MacBook?

A: I would recommend you use Numbers from Apple. It is a very powerful tool, yet very easy to get started with.
You find more information about it on the Apple product page: http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/
Here are some hints for your requested features:


*

*Filtering of tables http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-cell

*Creating complex formulae http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-formula

*Formatting cells http://www.apple.com/iwork/tutorials/#numbers-format
If you are interested in scripting Numbers, I highly recommend you to check out the AppleScript language guide.
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/AppleScriptLanguageGuide.pdf
Numbers, as many other popular OSX applications, is fully scriptable using AppleScript.
My own experience with Numbers is great. I stopped using Excel a long time ago. I use it as my main spreadsheet application, and I found the learning curve is quite shallow. Although if you plan to become an expert user, it may take a while to adapt to the different environment. But as long as you go the "Apple way" by learning and using the built in tools, you will soon find yourself in a very comfortable spot.
A good example is the Address Book. Since I have started using the Address Book, mass mailing became very easy.

A: Before Apple came out with Numbers I used a nice application called Tables which isn't as powerful as Numbers but did the trick nicely in that it played well with my old Excel and AppleWorks files and was/is a clean and simple spreadsheet application. The latest version runs fine in Lion and the developer is quick to update it when bugs are reported.

I still have it and use it on older files that I've not converted to Numbers but Numbers is a more powerful tool and is probably the way to go.
