Q: Resizing/moving windows with keypress and mouse in Mac OS X A few years ago I remember a friend using an application in Ubuntu that made window management extremely easy. If you wanted to move the active window, you would press a key and drag the window by clicking anywhere on the window. If you wanted to resize the active window (proportionally), you would press a key and turn the wheel. I think this is very intuitive way to resize and move a window.
Are there any free applications for Mac OS X that can utilize similar mechanics? 

A: Afloat does moving and resizing as explained, and does more than that. I really loved this application.

A: Free:

A: Not exactly what you want but:


*

*zooming is build-in OS X. Go to System preferences -> Mouse  and check "Zoom while scroll wheel while holding Controll". After this you can zoom any part of the screen with CTRL+scrollwheel. It is not an "window zoom" but screen zoom - but sometimes helpful.
