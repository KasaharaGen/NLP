Q: I forgot the passcode for my iPad restrictions. How can I disable them? I added restrictions to my iPad and I forgot the passcode for them, now what? Is there a way to remove it without resetting the device?

A: The short answer is no. 
The long answer is wipe the device and then start over. If you have a backup, hopefully it's from before the restrictions were set.

A: There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from a device backup, called pinfinder. Download the tool at the pinfinder github page, make an unencrypted backup and follow the instructions.

A: According to Apple:

If you lose or forget your Restrictions passcode, you'll need to erase
  your device and then set it up as a new device to remove the passcode.
  Restoring the device won't remove the passcode.

So apparently restoring from a "pre restrictions" backup won't help either.

A: Alternatively one can use Forgot iPhone via iCloud to Erase their phone if the problem is similar to this
This will wipe your entire data and you can setup your iPhone as new.
