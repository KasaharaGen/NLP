Q: Same Files in Two Folders, But Different Size Info? Can anyone tell me how this is possible? The files in these two folders are exactly the same, but the file size reported for the folders is different. Any ideas?

A: Are you certain that the folders do not contain any hidden files?  If you have anything beginning with a period (.) then this will not be reported in the Finder but will still be  contributing to the size of the folder.
Try looking in at the folders in Terminal with ls -la to see the file contents. You can check the disk usage with du -sh 
Open Terminal
cd /Users/Wesley/Desktop/untitled\ folder
ls -la Working NotWorking
du -sh Working NotWorking
