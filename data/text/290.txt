Q: Where is my crontab file? I want to edit my crontab file to schedule a script. Where do I find it?

A: It should be noted that if you aren't accustomed to using vim (the default crontab editor) then you can specify your editor as follows:
VISUAL=nano crontab -e


A: The OS X way is to use launchctl to run jobs at a time.
For ease of use there are GUIs called Launch Control and Lingon.

A: In Mac OS X Lion the user crontabs are stored in /var/at/tabs. In the past they were located in /var/cron/tabs.
You should use crontab -e to interact with these in general, but knowing the location is useful for when you want to restore them from a backup of your disk, or something similar.

*/var is a link to /private/var/.

*/usr/lib/cron is a link to /var/at.

The real primary directory is /private/var/at with the crontab files being stored in /private/var/at/tabs

A: If you don't want to use launchd, you can edit your crontab as you would do on any unix systems :

crontab -e

Or, you can use a GUI software like CronniX.
