Q: External video cards with MacBook Pro? I need to connect two displays to my MacBook Pro, and I read a recommendation to use external video cards to accomplish this. How can I do this? Do I just buy a video card and some kind of case which can connect to Thunderbolt? I'd really like to use Thunderbolt as it's so much faster than USB2.0. 
Since I'm getting a 17" MacBook Pro, I'm also getting an expresscard port. Will I be able to do something with this? Cheap is the price I'm looking for. :)

A: The most supported option would be to get a pair of Thunderbolt displays and use those. Note that will black out the screen on your MacBook (source).
I don't think there are good cheap options out there.

A: These EVGA boxes will do the trick, just don't expect them to have full hardware acceleration, but they work for displaying data and most programs fine. $60

But Matrox makes a non-cheap version called the Triple-head-to-go $300+
