Q: Changing the resolution of the iPod Touch 4th generation My son was playing with my iPod Touch 4th generation and changed the screen resolution.  I don't know how to fix this.  
How do I change the screen resolution back to what it is supposed to be?  
Everything on my iPod is way too big and I can't do anything.  

A: I think you may have turned on the Zoom or Large Text feature. Head over to Settings > General > Accessibility. turn zoom off in there, or Large Text. 


A: In case your son does it again: If you ever get stuck at a fully zoomed in view, double tap with three fingers to fully zoom in/out.
