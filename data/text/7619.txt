Q: Why doesn't Automator service appear in iTunes? I'm trying to write an Automator service for iTunes so that I can immediately open a file from iTunes in VLC, so I don't have to do (show in finder, launch with other application, vlc).
I go to Automator, create a Service, in the top right dropdowns, I choose: "Service receives selected audio files in any application", and the script itself is just "Open Finder Items" with VLC. 
However, the service doesn't appear. Not in finder, not in iTunes.. I'm very confused. Any thoughts what's going on? I tried restarting computer, restarting iTunes, all to no avail.
Thanks!

A: To get it to work in iTunes, you can try setting it up like this:
Service receives selected: text in: iTunes
Actions:
"Get Selected iTunes Tracks" - Get selected: tracks
"Open Finder items" - Open with: VLC
