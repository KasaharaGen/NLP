Q: Where can I find a map of my MBP french keyboard layout? I just moved to Mac and I need to get used to the keyboard of my Macbook Pro. I've seen images / maps of the QWERTY keyboards but could not find a proper one for French. I want to see what the modifier and options keys does etc. For example finding pipe (|)  was by luck but where the heck are the square brackets?!
Here is my layout:


A: To activate the Keyboard Viewer, click on the Input Menu on the right side of your menu bar, and then click on "Show Keyboard Viewer".

Simple as that! :)
