Q: Fastest way to split a video file into two? Does anyone know of software for OS X that can quickly split a 2 hour H.264 video file into two 1 hour files? iMovie estimates 2 hours just to import the file. I was hoping for something that could do it quicker.

A: The easiest tool would probably be Quicktime 7 Pro.  I believe it is available on Apple's store for $30.
If you prefer a CLI method, take a look at mp4box.  It has a -split option that does what you're describing.

A: You might also be able to do this using Quicktime X. Open the movie, then choose Edit -> Trim... Trim away the second part of the movie file and do a save as to get the first part in a separate file. Re-open the original file and trim away the first part, save as to get the second part in a separate file. 
I've only been able to try it with a 5 minute long movie, which was quick enough, but I'm unsure of how quickly it'll work with a 2 hour movie.

A: Movie Splitter

Split MPEG-4 movies with ease and speed.

Movie Splitter can split your H.264 (.mp4) movie into two halves. A multi-gigabyte split typically takes a minute or two. The bulk of the time is spent reading and writing the file.
If an application takes longer than a few minutes, it is likely re-encoding your movie. You do not want this because it risks reducing the quality of your split movie files.
Please note I wrote Movie Splitter and am likely bias.


A: Some other options are:


*

*Splitfuse
($12, free to try)

*Simple Video Splicer which looks free, but I havn't tried it. You'll see the link on the right of the dev's page.
