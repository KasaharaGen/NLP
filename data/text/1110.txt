Q: How do I make the Globe key disappear from the keyboard? I do some dev and testing on the iPhone. Recently, I was testing some localizations and needed to change the language. I've since changed back to English, but now whenever I bring up a keyboard a "globe" key is always near the bottom of the keyboard. This annoys the heck out of me because I keep accidentally tapping it. Any way to turn it off? 

A: Under Settings > General > Keyboard > International Keyboards you've got a list of all the keyboard layouts available.
To remove the "Globe" key, you need to have only one keyboard enabled.
