Q: On an iPhone, how can I tell when an accurate GPS position has been acquired? When taking photos I like having my pictures geo-tagged.
How can I tell when an accurate GPS location is available?

A: Launch the Maps app and wait for the blue orb to pulse which indicates a full GPS lock. No other way to do this from within the Camera app.
