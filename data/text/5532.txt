Q: Install Mac OS X Lion from newly installed SDD in Mac Book Pro A1260 (2008 model) I have an old Mac Book Pro A1260 (2008 early model), and I need to replace the old HDD with SDD. In doing so, I'm thinking about installing Mac OS X Lion.
Can I install Mac OS X Lion directly to my Mac? Do I need to install snow leopard first, and then upgrade to Mac OS X Lion?
