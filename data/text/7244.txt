Q: I am not able to see or use cut/paste in lion I upgraded to lion on the day it was released. After that I updated my system twice even then I am not able to see any cut paste option as specified here.

Mine is still:-
Note: Command+Option+V  is not working for me. Nothing happens :(

A: You have to press the Option key BEFORE clicking Edit on the Menu. This will dynamically change the menu to show the "move" option.

A: Assuming you have tried (Command ⌘ + C) and (Command ⌘ + V), as sometimes it will not show in the edit menu, try a P-RAM reset on the computer. Turn your computer off, then turn on while holding Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + P + R, the computer will turn off and on, wait for four charms before releasing. Hopefully this will resolve your issue.
