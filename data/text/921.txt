Q: Conkeror as default browser on Mac OS 10.6 I'd like to use Conkeror as default browser in Mac OS 10.6. Selecting conkeror.app as default browser with Safari does not work. While it is possible to start Conkeror via Firefox command line arguments (-app), opening additional URLs with that instance is not.
If anyone has been able to setup Conkeror on Mac OS 10.6 in a way that...


*

*uses Conkeror as default browser for all applications

*reuses a running Conkeror instance when opening an URL (either current or new buffer) 


..., could you post the steps necessary to do so?
P.S.: Feel free to retag with 'conkeror'
EDIT: In addition to the Info.plist solution posted below, you also need the line
url_remoting_fn = load_url_in_new_buffer
in your .conkerorrc, if you want to open URLs in an existing window.

A: Select Conkerer as your default through Safari's preferences.
Update per the comment: From their website: "Unfortunately, at this time, there doesn't seem to be a way on OSX to configure conkeror as your default browser. " I just happened to stumble across that. I had never heard of Conkerer until now.

A: Sure it's possible to set Conkeror as the default web browser; it just needs a properly structured Info.plist file.
I created one here: http://www.markdouma.com/developer/ConkerorInfoPlist.zip
Just download that, unzip it, and replace the following Info.plist file with the one included in the download:
/Applications/conkeror.mozdev.org/conkeror/Contents/Info.plist
Note: after completing this, make sure you touch the application bundle, which will force Launch Services to re-examine and re-register the app and its newly found capability for the http:// and https:// URL types. In other words, the following should be sufficient:
touch /Applications/conkeror.mozdev.org/conkeror.app
Then deselect and re-select the app icon in the Finder.
Launch Safari, and choose Conkeror from the popup menu:

FWIW, I changed the Info.plist to be the following:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"

A: springify, it's not possible to set conkeror as the default browser on OS X.

A: Have you checked out Default App? It's a preference pane you can install to set any app as a default for a number of different tasks. 
It's running on my Macbook running 10.6, and let's me choose any app I want for browsers; I don't have Conkerer but I can only assume it'd work for that too. Worth a download anyway.
Hope this helps.

A: So under the hood, Workgroup Manager creates a plist located at...
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.internet.plist
Which contains this information...
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>mcx_defaultWebBrowser</key>
    <string>/Applications/Google Chrome.app</string>
</dict>
</plist>
So create that file and change "/Applications/Google Chrome.app" to whatever the path of your application is. Hopefully that will fix your issue.
