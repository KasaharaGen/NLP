Q: How to change speed of podcast playback on iPad running iOS 5's Music app? It seems the option to enable double, normal, or half speed playback is gone from the Music app on iPads running iOS 5.
Anyone ran into this? Workarounds?

A: It seems the speed controls are available in iOS 5.1. They just are not there in 5.0.

A: I wish I knew the answer. Mine has defaulted to half speed. :(
I do have a workaround you might be interested in though. After muh searching, I found an app called SpeedUp Player, which lets you set a playback speed between 0.5x and 2.5x. It's not perfect, but it does the job as a temporary fix.

A: I have not had this issue myself, but several of my listeners have mentioned it. Has anyone tried removing the podcasts in question from syncing in iTunes and then reenabling it so the files are removed from and then copied back on to the device?

A: For the audiobook and/or podcast in question, open up it's information box and click the "Options" button. In this section make sure the "Media Kind" is set to eiter "Audiobook" or "Podcast". iTunes relies solely on this paramater to know what playback features will be available for the media file in question. Playback speed options are only enabled for items marked as either of these two categories.
