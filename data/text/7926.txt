Q: iWork Numbers evaluate string I have a cell with the following content 2262/4121. I want to have a cell next to it that contains the result of that expression. Is there a function for that?

A: You can use the VALUE() function for that. Its only argument is the cell that you want to evaluate
From the documentation:

The VALUE function returns a number value, even if the argument is formatted as text. This function is included for compatibility with tables imported from other spreadsheet apps.
VALUE(source-string)
  source-string: Any value.
Notes
  You’ll never need to use the VALUE function in a new table, because numbers in text are automatically converted for you.
Only the formatted text is converted. For example, if you type the string $100.001 into a cell, the default format will display only two decimals ($100.00). If VALUE refers to this cell, it will return 100, the value of the formatted text, not 100.001.
If the argument can’t be returned as a number value (does not contain a number), the function returns an error.
Examples
=VALUE(“22”) returns the number 22.
=VALUE(RIGHT(“The year 1953”, 2)) returns the number 53.


A: In the general case you're stuck. But in a special case you might be able to do something. To add up a column of inconveniently formatted numbers, I wrote a formula that uses two other formulas to extract intermediate values from the text:
  input       number   scale    answer
