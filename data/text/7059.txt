How to mount SFTP/SSH in Finder on OSX Snow Leopard? 

I remotely manage many servers every day. I'm currently using Nautilus in Ubuntu and it's awesome. 
Before buying a Mac, I'd like to know if there's anything similar or equivalent to browse SSH servers visually over SSH for OSX.

A: You could connect to your remote host via sshfs over fuse. An implementation for OSX is MacFUSE. A nice fronted for macfuse is MacFusion.
A crossplatform solution for accessing ssh/sftp enabled hosts is MuCommander which provides a commander-like interface to your remote host.

A: Cyberduck does sftp so it can display remote files through an SSH connection.

A: ssh -X 

will do it in mac, this will open X11 on your mac when you start an x application in your ssh session to your server.
the ssh client is native to mac (because it is BSD based) and can be started from the terminal
If you are managing windows servers RDP for mac is excellent as well.
