Q: App that turns the menubar black/dark? Is there an app that can change the color of the menubar? I saw one that I'm pretty sure wasn't Nocturne.

A: LeoColorBar (Free)
Allows you to change the color of the menu bar.
MenuShade (Free)
Allows you to dim the menu bar.
Here's a tutorial on changing the menu bar to black.

A: not an app, but you could use obsidian menubar by Max Rudberg. it's an installer that changes menubar's pngs and substitute  os x's black menubar icons (as well as some 3rd party ones) with white ones. 
see more infos here or download it directly from Max's website
