Q: Securing my data when recycling iPod at the Apple Store I'd like to get a new iPod touch, I'd also like to not have to re-input all my contacts and notes (don't mind clearing out the apps) but I want to make sure of two things before I go in and take advantage of the 10% discount at the Apple Store.

*Can I backup my data on an as updated as possible 2nd gen iPod and restore it onto a shiny new 4th gen iPod?

*Can I make sure (within reason) that my data is cleared off the iPod when I turn it in to the Apple store? 

A: *

*Yes, your backed up data in iTunes from your 2nd gen iPod should be able to be restored into a new 4th gen iPod, based on my experience upgrading from a 1st gen iPod Touch to an iPhone.

*Regarding clearing data, check out this ZDnet blog post. It includes information about the Erase all Content and Settings option that you can use to wipe the iPod, including a quote from Apple Support. More specific details for all Apple iDevices can be found on this Apple page.
