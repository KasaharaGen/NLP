Q: My headphone set doesn't play any sound After plugging in my headphone into my iphone 4s no sound comes through. I can
hear the music from the phone itself. Do I need to change the settings?

A: I had the same issue with a 4 and a 3GS, the solution? it was dust, I had to use a pin to get dust out, after that it worked. 
If that is not the issue, try using the headphones in another device. Also try using other headphones in the iPhone.

A: Maybe you are not pushing it in all the way.  I thought mine were defective until I pushed harder than I thought I should.
If you have any kind of phone protector make sure the jack hole opening is not not obstructed by the cover! You might have to stretch the cover hole a little to push headphone jack all the way in! That was my problem it works fine when in all the way.
