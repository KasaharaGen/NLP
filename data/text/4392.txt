Q: Can you run Samba on Snow Leopard workstations? it appears that Samba functionality is restricted to the server edition of OS X 10.6 - is there a workaround or third-party solution?

A: File sharing is available on the client under System Preferences>Sharing>File Sharing. 
You can then select what to share. Once you've done that click the options button. And select the third option shown in the image below.
