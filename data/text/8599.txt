Q: Preventing apps from opening in Lion on reboot

Uncheck “Reopen windows when logging back in” by default 

On Mac Lion after reboot, the applications come up immediately. Is there a way to prevent it. From searching over the net, it looks like the user has to disable it explicitly. My problem is I am setting this for a lab at a university and they have many macs. I cannot ask the students to do this individually. I have to set something up. Is this possible ? First of all programmatically(either via applescript or a launchd) ?. Second, if so, is there a good approach ?.
