Q: How to download the .mov for later viewing? I would like to download the keynote speech on
http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1103pijanbdvaaj/event/index.html
so that when Apple remove the video later, I can still watch it later...
but there seems to be no easy way, except if I buy the Pro version of QuickTime?
some meta file shows these addresses, but the first one will save as a 1k file to show the second address, and the second one can't be saved because it is rstp:// not http://:

Someone mentioned using Ubuntu Linux's Movie player to download it but it seems there is no save option?

A: Usually, Apple put it's keynotes in iTunes Podcasts, where you can download them.
Look for Apple Keynote and download the ones you want.
Just note that there might be delay, often less than a week, before they released the latest keynote.
