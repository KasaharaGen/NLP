Q: I sync'ed twice for my iPhone 4S and my iMac, but it still asked me to transfer purchased content to my Library? iOS 5.0.1 is out and I want to do any upgrade, but when I click Update, it will pop out a window that says:

So I sync'ed the iPhone 4S once, and it pop out the same dialog.  I sync'ed again and it was the same thing.  Is it not good enough to just sync?  What should be done to "transfer the purchased items to my Library"?  

A: Follow the steps in this Apple support page. This page goes through the steps to ensure that iTunes on the target computer is authorized, and the steps to transfer are:


*

*Connect your device to the computer. 

*Select the Transfer Purchases menu option

You should then be able to upgrade your iPhone without any additional prompts.
