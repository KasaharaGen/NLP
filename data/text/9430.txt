Q: Authenticating file movements in Lion Why do I have to authenticate moving every file and folder into my hard drive -- where I store all of my files?  It's a pain!  

A: Cause maybe you're not an admin and the admin is protecting his main disk. Could you provide more information about who you are (user-wise of course: admin, normal user,...) and which files you are trying to move and to what (internal, external,...)
