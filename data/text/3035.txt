Q: Why is Safari displaying scrambled graphics? When I click on "new tab" in safari, I see this flicker often as a new tab is opening: 

Any idea why this is? It seems to be a scrambled cache of my graphics card... (In case you're wondering, the sushi stuff is from my iOS game, Nippon.)

A: This isn't so much a Safari problem as it is an OS X / hardware one. I'm going to guess that you have Intel or Nvidia graphics on a MacBook (Pro).
It's well-documented; there are lots of people with these issues (including myself). As far as I've found, you can't fix it. Just restart or wait it out.
Sorry I can't be more useful.
