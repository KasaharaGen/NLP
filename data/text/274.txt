Q: Defer Sending Email using Mail.app I'm curious, does anybody have a decent solution for sending e-mails via Mail.app at some scheduled times? I'm badly in need of something like that :)

A: I believe that you don’t consider Deferrersender (web based) to be decent. It’s not, but it delivers. 
UPDATE: An alternative, that doesn’t use Mail.app (but Thunderbird) would be to use SendLater. An extension that does exactly that. But it’s for Thunderbird. I couldn’t find a similar plug-in for Mail.app.

A: You can use Apple scripts to setup mail app schedule mail via iCal

Or use web based service as Martin said
