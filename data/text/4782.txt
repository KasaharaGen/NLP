Q: Is there a way to forward individual voicemails on the iPhone I would like to send a voicemail I received to someone else for them to be able to listen to the exact same audio.
Is there a way to forward an individual voicemail to someone else, whether by email or some other means?

A: Hopefully someone else can provide an easier answer or an app that automates this, but the method I've found so far only works for jailbroken phones:


*

*Use iFile or some other file manager to access .amr files that are stored in /var/mobile/Library/Voicemail. The files are numbered sequentially and voicemail.db looks like its used to organize them.

*Try to locate the correct .amr using timestamp.

*Use file manager to email .amr file to myself or someone else.


A sidenote is that doing this I was able to find some orphaned .amr files that seemed to not have been completely deleted (.amr files are still stored when deleted until they are cleared from Deleted Messages). I was able to safely delete these old voicemails (over a year old, probably persisting from backups) from the folder.
