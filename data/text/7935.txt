Q: Disable Inverted Scrolling using Mighty Mouse I currently use two 2011 iMac's equipped with Mighty Mouse - the round mouse with a rubber scroll ball. When I go to scroll through pages or folders though, it is inverted. By this I mean that down is up, and up is down. I have been told there is a "natural scrolling" option somewhere in the settings, but I have yet to find it, only mentions of using it with the trackpad. How can I disable the inverted scrolling using a Mighty Mouse?
I am running OS X Lion. The mouse is wired 


A: Simon, assuming your mouse is connected, the screen should look like the one below.
Uncheck "Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating."


A: Lion did change this on you.
Depending on what hardware you have connected, the mouse pane, the magic mouse version of the mouse pane and the trackpad preferences all have a toggle to show if "Natural Scrolling" is enabled or disabled.
If you want your finger moving up on the mouse wheel to move the scroll thumb up (and the document down) just like Snow Leopard, then un-check the box to the left of Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating
 

If you have other pointing devices (and those reading along at home), hop over to confirm that one setting governs direction on the Mighty Mouse, the Magic Mouse and Trackpad preferences - scroll direction carries over to all input sources.
 

A: System Preferences > Mouse > Top Middle 
Checkbox for turning off natural scrolling
