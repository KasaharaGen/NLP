Q: Selecting all photos in photo booth with a single gesture Is there a way to select all the photos in the iPad 2's photo booth application and copy them to a new/existing album? currently I need to select each photo individually by clicking (touching) it. 
Am I missing some kind of gesture that will allow me to select all of the existing photos in photo booth?

A: EDIT: (Originally I had described a way to select multiple photos via the "Photos" app, and I didn't realize you could do that directly within Photo Booth.)
In short, no, you're not missing a secret gesture -- that's currently the only way to do it.
And unfortunately, I do not believe there is a way to create a new photo album on the iPad itself -- you'll have to do that on your computer and sync with iTunes to see the changes.
