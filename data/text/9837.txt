Q: How would I restore Spotlight search to my menu bar? (10.7) For some inexplicable reason, I decided to delete (not hide) Spotlight from my Mac via a terminal command. I downloaded the 10.7.2 update, hoping it would fix this by redownloading Spotlight, but it did not. 
This is what happens when you give an idiot access to the terminal. 
For reference, I this is my menubar right now:

I tried this method to be sure I simply didn't hide the Spotlight icon. 
Spotlight is still in the system preferences.
I am just interested in fixing this. I should note that I didn't reinstall the OS.
Thanks for the help. 

A: I would imagine that inverting your commands would do the trick. Try:
sudo mdutil -a -i on
sudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search
sudo killall SystemUIServer


A: While there may well be a more granular approach, this should work (but will take a bit of time):
Step 1: Back up your machine to an external drive using Time Machine
Step 2: Boot holding âŒ˜R to boot from the restore partition
Step 3: Re-install Lion
Step 4: Use Migration Assistant to reinstall your documents and applications from your Time Machine backup.
This should leave you with an intact system, but all your data and applications.
