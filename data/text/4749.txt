Q: Is there a black&white option for color printer when using air print? airprint is pretty cool. On my Mac and PC I could setup a separate profile to use my color printer in black&white mode. Is it possible to do the same when using air print from iphone/ipad?

A: The built-in AirPrint doesn't allow this sort of functionality as of iOS 4, but if you get the HP ePrint app, you should be able to do B&W printing and manage other settings. This of course only works if you have an AirPrint/ePrint HP printer, it won't work with any other printer that you've hacked to set up with AirPrint.

A: Printopia for Mac will let you configure what settings the printer will use when you AirPrint. For example, you can select to use B&W only.
