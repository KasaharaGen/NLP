Q: What is the release schedule for the next Mac Pro (desktop)? I work on many projects at once and my MacBook Pro is not cutting it anymore. I will be purchasing a Mac Pro (desktop) soon, but want to make sure a new model is not on the verge of coming out. Does anyone know the release schedule for the next Mac Pro?
Thanks, Chirag

A: I would wait. See http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro for the timeline of recent updates.
