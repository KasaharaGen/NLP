Q: External disk stalls iMac I have a weird problem with an external disk connected to my 27" iMac running OS X 10.6.5.
It is a 1TB LaCie d2 Quadra and it is connected through Firewire.
I use this disk primarily for Time Machine backups, which works well and fast.
The problem is that when this disk wakes up, it locks up the complete iMac. While I hear the disk spin up my iMac is unresponsive. Then when the disk is ready, the iMac comes back to life.
What is going on here?

A: What is going on is that OS X (actually it’s the Finder and the I/O subsystem) is “waiting” for the drive to be readable. 
Truth is, is not the “whole mac” but the Finder (and any Finder application) what freezes. For example, a Save/Open dialog, Time Machine starting, a Finder window, etc. However you can always cmd-tab and perform other actions.
There isn’t much you can do, except to tell OS X not to sleep your hard drives (or wait for the drive to spin up):
. Beware with that option, because it will mean that your hard drives are on all the time, thus degrading their lifespan. 
I’m not 100% sure if that option affects Firewire/USB external drives, but I think it does.
