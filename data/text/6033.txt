Q: After upgrade to Lion, Mailplane experiences repeated failures to connect I'm a happy longtime Mailplane (Mac gmail client) user, but it seems to have become buggy since installing Lion.
There's nothing official on the website about problems, so maybe its just me and/or my configuration.
Anybody else have problems? Any ideas?

A: FWIW, I have been using Mailplane on Lion on my MacBooks (Air&Pro) without any bugginess. (Have you contacted the dev? He's been very responsive in my experience.)
If you didn't do a clean install of Lion (or used MobileMe to sync preferences) you might want to backup


*

*${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Mailplane

*${HOME}/Library/Preferences/com.mailplaneapp.Mailplane.plist


(If you don't have your license file, be sure to save
defaults read com.mailplaneapp.Mailplane License

too.)
zip/email them to yourself and then delete them -- not just trash them -- from your system. Reboot.
Then try setting up Mailplane again.
