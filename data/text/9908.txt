Q: Is it possible to purchase the OEM USB sync cable? Is it possible to buy the genuine Apple USB sync cable for iPad/iPhone/iPod? I know there are many aftermarket cables available, but most of them seem inferior.

A: Yes - look for Apple USB to dock connector in the store. 
It also comes with most chargers and dock accessories if you want a bundle.
