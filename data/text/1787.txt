Q: Can I browse the Mac App Store without Snow Leopard? I understand that Snow Leopard is required to install the Mac App Store and actually install apps. But is it possible to browse the store on the web the way you can with the iTunes Store?

A: It is not possible to browse the App Store. But if you have a link, such as this one, then you can view the app description in your browser.

A: The need of 10.6 is clearly stated on Apple website here. Click then on Get the Mac App Store. See How button.
You then see "The Mac App Store is available as a free software update for Mac computers running Mac OS X v10.6 or later. If you have an earlier version of Mac OS X, you will need to upgrade to Mac OS X Snow Leopard."
