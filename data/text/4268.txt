Q: Add 2 mobile numbers to iphone I checked all the answers to my question (how to add two mobile numbers to one contact in iPhone) but I didn't see a clear answer.
A lot of my contacts have more than one mobile number, and while my android phone syncs beautifully with gmail contacts (multiple mobile numbers), my iPhone 4 only allowing me one mobile number. After that when I click on add, I get a list of home,work,fax,etc. But no second mobile number.
My 5 years old Nokia phone let me add custom labels to any phone number, like I can add a number and name it "boat phone" , gmail contacts also can do it.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

A: A custom label will have to suffice here. I have many contacts with their cell phones listed as 'mobile', and then a custom 'Google Voice' labeled number.
[edit]
An alternative to this is to make the change via Address Book.app on your computer, then sync the contacts to your phone.
Custom labels are available in all contact adding/modification screens.
First, browse to a contact, and tap the label name (to the left of a phone number, e-mail address, etc.). You will see the list of labels.

Second, swipe all the way to the bottom, and tap on "Add Custom Label".

Type in a new Custom Label;

And then it will be displayed next to the number.

It will now appear in a list of custom labels on later access.

A: You probably have your Google Sync turned on. Go into Settings on your iPhone, choose "Mail, Contacts, Calendars", choose the Google account your contacts are synced with, turn off "Contacts". Now you can create multiple fields with the same label.
After turning this feature off, some of your contacts may no longer appear on your phone, or they may appear with missing information. But they are still on your Google account, you can export your google contacts and re-import them into your phone instead of syncing them. Or you can sync again to bring all your contacts back.
