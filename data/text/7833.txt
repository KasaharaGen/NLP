Q: Truly Minimize All Windows

How to minimize all windows/applications to the dock? 

I am aware of the F11 shortcut, but that doesn't really minimize all windows - it moves them to different corners and then when I open something up they ALL come back. The closest thing I have to making this work is by pressing F11, then Command + Option + Desktop click.
Are there any easier ways? 

A: Try the Finder keyboard shortcut Option-Command-M. Other very handy shortcuts are available on this article at the Apple Support site. Hope this helps. 

A: Click on desktop area (or just switch Finder) then just hit CMD+ALT+H.
