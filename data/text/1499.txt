Q: Dial another phone, access SMS of another phone using IPOD Touch 4 I have an IPOD Touch 4 and i was hoping to convert it to a phone. However in india we don't have VOIP support, but my phone "HTC TOUCH" supports Remote Sim. I am looking for an app which can allow my ipod to control my phone and also enable me to make calls thru my ipod by dialing on my phone. is it possible?

A: Not possibly currently I'm afraid. Certainly, you'd have to have a jailbroken Touch as a starting point. No way you'd be able to do this on a stock iPod Touch. Even then, I'm not aware of anything out there that will do this.
