Q: Can I install OSX Safari 5.1 for one user and Safari 5.05 for another user - same CPU? I'm running OSX 10.6.8 with Safari 5.01 with my main user account, which is an admin account.
I would like to do some testing with Safari 5.1 before I fully commit to it.
Can I install Safari 5.1 in another user account (non-admin) and keep the Safari 5.05 functional in my admin account?
Can I just install it in the ~/Applications directory of the non-admin user?

A: The person behind Multi-Safari has documented the procedure to create a Safari application with a self-contained WebKit framework here.
Basically it involves duplicating the Safari application, opening the contents and creating a Frameworks folder inside, copying the Framework from /System/Library/Frameworks and then performing some jiggery-pokery to get the application to prefer to use the self-contained framework over the one in the Library folder.
(I decided not to copy his instructions word for word, as his website didn't use Creative Commons.)

A: Why don't you install a Webkit beta? It will be similar to 5.1 (or probably 5.2!) and you can install it alongside your older version of Safari.
You can get it here:
http://nightly.webkit.org/
In case you haven't encountered them before these betas are the truly cutting edge versions of Safari as it is developed.
TBH I have been using 5.1 since the Dev betas (months ago!) and have found them very stable and fast - better than 5.0 IMO.

A: While they don't have version 5, you could install Safari 5.1 as your main browser and then use Multi-Safari to access an earlier version. I hope this helps a little bit.

A: No, I don't think so. Reason is that Safari updates replace the whole webkit framework which is a part of OS X, so you can only have one version at a time.
