Q: In Keynote, how to have image mask start with the entire image Frequently when pasting images into Keynote for Mac, I want to crop off a small piece of the image, say on the bottom or the right.
When I apply an image mask, Keynote defaults to a small square inside the image, forcing me to drag the square to the original image boundaries, after which I can crop off the small piece.
It would be much better if the mask were started with the same pixel size as the image, surrounding the entire image. 
Is there any way to get it to do so?
