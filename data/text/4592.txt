Q: simple MP3 player with folders I've been using SoundJam MP since it came out and many years ago I found a beta version that worked on OS X and that's the reason I can still use it.
Unfortunately, with OS X Lion, PPC support is gone and I need to find a similar app for my music listening.
My main objective is to find a software that allows me to add folders with MP3s and allows me to sort it manually and even sort the files inside the folder, instead of (as iTunes and others do) having the app sort it by album/artist, because I have several MP3s that aren't even tagged and I want to control it and not let the app sort and "mix" (wrongly) for me.
I've searched a lot and tried so many apps already without success (ex: cog, instinctiv, neutrino, songbird, vox).
Anyone knows of such a software?
P.S. the app can be either free or paid (reasonably priced).

A: Hm, I'm maybe not fully understand the question, but the VLC player cannot do the job?
You can drag into the playlist window any music files (in fact any multimedia files), can rearrange them manually and so on..
so use the VLC as a music player and not as a video-player.
