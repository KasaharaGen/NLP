Q: Is there a good way to control VLC media player on my MacBook from an iOS 5 iPhone? I see a free application in the App Store but the reviews say it doesn't work.
I have a Snow Leopard MacBook that I hook up to my TV to watch videos sometimes. To control the video and volume, it'd be nice if I could do this from my iPhone. How could this setup be done?

A: Something like VLC Amigo (free) or VLC remote for iPhone would probably work! 

A: I use Remotebuddy. It has controls for VLC and much, much more.
You can trial it for 30 days to see how you like it.


A: HippoRemote is awesome for controlling VLC, iTunes player, and the Mac. 

A: Have a look at Sybu Data Remote Control for VLC
It works perfectly with OSX and iOS 5 & 6, easy to install, NO ads, and FREE.
A must have App if you have an iPhone and use VLC
