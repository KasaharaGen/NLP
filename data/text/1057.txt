Q: Bluetooth Not Available? Mac OS X 10.6.4, MacBook Pro, Apple Magic Trackpad.
The trackpad is unresponsive. Right-clicking on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar shows me gray text that says "Bluetooth not available".
I don't see a system preference item in which to fight with this, but I don't see anything relevant.

A: According to this article, resetting the System Management Controller might to the trick.
Here's how to Reset the SMC on Apple's support site.

A: Under System Preferences there should be a bluetooth preference pane. Make sure it's set to 'on' and 'discoverable'.

A: In terminal, also remove the com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist and com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist files from ~/Library/Preferences.
cd ~/Library/Preferences
rm com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist
rm com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist

Then restart.
That fixed it for me.

A: Resetting the NVRAM as described here solved the issue for me:

A: Had this problem since 2015 and I have tried just about everything suggested by this thread similar ones. The only solution I have come across that works 100% for me is by going to System Preferences -> General -> unchecking Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices
It has been a month of observing this problem that occured daily and never had an issue afterwards. Hope this might help some of you out there.

A: I fixed it by 


*

*shutting down the machine

*removing battery

*keep power button pressed for 10 sec

*start machine again


A: I have fixed by the same method as above.  shut down, remove battery, hold down power button for 10 seconds, replace battery and re-start
