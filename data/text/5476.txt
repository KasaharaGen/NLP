Q: Keyboard shortcut for Spotlight doesn't work in full screen Google Chrome on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) I've noticed that the Spotlight Search keyboard shortcut (cmd space) doesn't work if I'm running Google Chrome (12.0.742.122) as full screen application in Lion.
Is this a Chrome-related bug or is this inherent of some type of applications? Is there a way to fix it?

A: Chrome doesn't currently support Lion's full screen features. They are working on a version that does.
Until that is finished, you'll have to use Chrome's built-in full screen capabilities (not based on Lion's).
You can change the keyboard shortcut to enter that the same way you'd change any other (System Preferences-> Keyboard-> Keyboard Shortctus-> [+] button

A: Problem seems to be resolved in newer Chrome versions.

A: No such problem with Safari (just tried it). the way to fix it: just switch to safari :P it's the same webkit rendering engine as chrome (meaning it's the same speed) and now it's a whole lot nicer with some of the new lion features
