Q: Expanding OSX partition and deleting Windows paritition I have created a Windows partition with Bootcamp. Now I would like to get rid of this partition and attach the available space back to the primary Mac OS partition.
I have found various tutorials around the net, but most of them seem to be outdated. I am wondering what would be the correct procedure for Snow Leopard?

A: Simply open Boot Camp Assistant again and it will ask you if you want to restore the drive to one partition. Therefore deleting the boot camp partition.
