Q: Preview in Lion fails when any document opened has changed In Lion Preview.app, if I have many image files open in a single preview window (so that I can scroll through them) and one of them changes on disk (e.g., I remade the image with a plotting program or convert), instead of loading the new image, the whole preview window shows an empty background for all images, even those that have not changed.
In Snow Leopard and Leopard, preview would just reload the new image in place.
Is there any way to fix the Lion version of Preview?
EDIT: related post refresh Preview from command line 

A: A rather unsatisfactory solution might be File->Open Recent->*top of the list*
I suggest unsatisfactory because 


*

*it launches a new window

*you have to go and close the old window

*the folder you are in might not be at the top of the list

*it's not a keyboard shortcut

*it's not automatic

*it requires a lot of mousing and a couple of clicks

*it makes me have to think


but i digress with this bitching and moaning, did anyone post an issue with Apple or find the proper solution?
