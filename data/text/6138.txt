Q: Can I dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion? I own a Mac Mini 3.1 with Snow Leopard installed. I would like to dual boot with Lion for development purposes.
I have partitioned my hardisk as described in Point (1) in this tutorial 
How to Install Dual Boot Mac OSX Lion and Snow Leopard
Can I now buy and download Lion from the apple store and then install it on the new partition?

A: You'll need to make your own bootable DVD/USB of the Lion installer to do so. This can be made from the AppStore download and is documented well by OSXDaily.
Lion USB Installer
Lion DVD Installer
Then hold ALT at system boot (before chime & Apple logo) and select your install volume.

A: Buy and download the Lion needs the Mac AppStore.  So you need to boot with SL first, buy and download the Lion without installation.  Then follow @macaco's answer to have a clean installation.

A: Yes.
Open the installer in SL and choose the 2nd partition.
