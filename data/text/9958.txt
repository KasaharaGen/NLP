Q: My iPod Nano seems to have been lost in post! How do I contact Apple? I posted my iPod Nano to Apple two weeks ago, under their replacement service, but the "check repair status" says that they still haven't received it. Does anyone know a number or an email address I can use to chase this up?

A: Any web site in the UK  has to provide contact information. Apple has a comprehensive one.
