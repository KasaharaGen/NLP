Q: Restart OS X GUI I need to restart the WindowServer (OS X's GUI);
I know this can be achieved using the command sudo killall -HUP WindowServer 
but this closes all your open applications. Is there a way to restart the WindowsServer without it quitting all your open applications?

A: The WindowServer is responsible for drawing all Windows and Windows Content for all Programs (incl. Finder), so it would not be possible to kill the Process without killing all Applications.
You can read about the Window Server in the Apple Technical Note TN2083 for OSX 10.5.
Even though it is announced in that Document that Apple plans to change the Behaviour in future Systemversions, it's in your list of required OS's.

A: There is no way to restart window server without closing all apps; logging out & then back in is the best option

A: You can also try:
killall -KILL Dock


A: killall Finder         # what should work
killall SystemUIServer # what to run in addition if it does not

If any of the two do not restart (finder sometimes does not automatically reboot in my experience), then run these commands after the initial set:
open -a Finder
open -a SystemUIServer

This set of commands (specifically killall Finder) is almost exactly like taskkill /IM explorer.exe within the MS-DOS command line.

A: If this is to restart the GUI  without quitting all applications (to solve UI jitter, a duplicate mouse cursor, etc...) I found turning off the display works as well.
This earlier question has some information on how to do this.
