Q: iTunes Smart Playlist - currently playing track Is it possible to include the currently playing track in a smart playlist?  
Ultimately, what I'm after is a smart playlist that includes tracks without a rating and tracks that I've already rated 3-5.  If I rate something 1 or 2, I want it to keep playing until the end of the song instead of just automatically kicking it out of the playlist and skipping to the next song.

A: I think there's a two-step solution to this:
First create a smart playlist for tracks that are unrated or have 3-5 stars.
Second, set that playlist as the source for iTunes DJ, and play tracks using that. Last I checked, tracks would play through even if they wound up getting tagged in mid-play in a way that would remove them from the smart playlist.
