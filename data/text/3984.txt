Q: FaceTime added to Dock on Start Up I've encountered an interesting issue, and I am wondering if anyone else has experience with it.
Every time I restart my Mac, FaceTime is added back to the Dock. If I remove it from the Dock, it disappears. Restart, and it's back. I can remove other things just fine and they stay where they are, if I re-arrange FaceTime in the Dock it stays in its new position. Only when I remove it does something put it back.
Recent System Changes that might be causing it:


*

*EFI Update was just installed, it seemed to start happening as soon as it rebooted from installing this.

*XCode was upgrade from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2


Things I've tried:


*

*Deleting the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and rebuilt my Dock from scratch. After restarting, everything was exactly where I wanted it except the FaceTime app was added back.


(Anything else I try, I will edit and post here)
Has anyone else had problems with applications getting "stuck" in the Dock? How'd you fix it? FaceTime is neat, and I use it occasionally, but it isn't worth a dedicated spot on the Dock.

A: Remove them from your dock, then go under the go tab in finder to your hard drive, then to library, and then in the prefences folder find com.apple.dockfixup.plist and move it to the recycle bin. Problem solved. This worked for me and I am running Lion so, hopefully it will work for you...

A: This could be caused if your machine is managed -- more accurately, if your machine connected to an open directory server. Or perhaps to a OS X lion server, managing your machine's preferences.

A: Open Activity Monitor, kill the "apsd-ft" process, remove FaceTime and then install it again.
There's also another solution I found on google (link here):

I was able to finally fix the problem by using the option in Onyx for LaunchServices rebuild. No more Facetime icon on reboot.
