Q: Airport Extreme sharing 1TB disk I just bought an Airport Extreme thinking it was easy to share a USB disk.
I'm very disappointed that this is taking so much time and still not working.
The disk is 1TB NTFS formatted. It works well while connected directly to my MBP but via Airport Extreme I just can't get it work. Both on Mac and on Windows I can't connect, it's not discoverable. Even connecting via smb://10.0.0.1/mydisk won't work.
Is this due by the NTFS format or I'm just missing something?
Thank you

A: Airport Extreme does not support NTFS disks.
You can format your disk as FAT32 or (preferably) HFS+, a.k.a. Mac OS Extended (Journaled), and it should then be accessible to both Mac and PC clients.
