Q: Access iPod from Windows Explorer I just got my new iPod 4.
I wanted to use it as a storage device copying to it music and eBooks, but it doesn't show up on my computer.
I followed the direction in this page, but unfortunately, the option "Enable disk use" doesn't show up (iTunes 10), I've checked "Manually manage music and videos" instead, but it doesn't do the trick, and the device doesn't appear in Windows Explorer.

A: Do you mean an iPod Touch? IIRC "Enable Disk Use" is only for non-iOS devices. I don't know of a way in which you can manually copy songs from your computer to your iOS using the file system and have them play in the iPod.app on your iPod Touch. I believe Stanza allows you to copy ebooks from your computer to your iOS device but I'm not sure if it uses iTunes for that process.
