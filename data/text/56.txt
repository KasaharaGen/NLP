Q: What are your favorite Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts? What are your favorite keyboard shortcuts on Mac OS X?

A: For me the life saving shortcut is the quarter increment/decrement of light/sound:
⇧+⌥ and the increment/decrement light or sound button.
It is extremely useful with LED Cinema Display monitors.

A: ⌘+E: Put selected text into search clipboard.
Then ⌘ + G to find next.
In combination with regular copy-paste you can do selective search and replace very quickly and conveniently.

A: Here's a great one (for switchers) I got from the TextMate blog;
Create the folder ~/Library/KeyBindings (if it doesn't already exist)
In there, create a key-binding file DefaultKeyBinding.dict
In that file, put this text (including all braces & punctuation);

{
    /* home */
    "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
    "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";

    /* end */
    "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";
    "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";

    /* page up/down */
    "\UF72C"  = "pageUp:";
    "\UF72D"  = "pageDown:";
}

Save the file, and when you next start a Cocoa app (eg Mail, TextEdit etc) you will find that Home, End, Pg Up and Pg Down now work as they do on Windows.
It's well worth having a look at the whole of that article - he explains exactly how to make this file and how the bindings work, with information about the other keycodes etc.

A: ⇧+⌘+?: Help->Search, then type any menu item text, can be just a prefix
⌘+E: put selected text in search dialog
⌘+G and ⇧+⌘+G: find next/previous
⇧+⌃+⌘+4: Take a screenshot, press space for whole window screenshot
ctrl + mouse scroller: zoom screen
⌥+⌘+⏏: sleep

A: *

*ctrl+A: Go to the beginning of the line (works in every Cocoa textfield)

*⌘+⇧+H : Pop up the Home folder

*⌘+⇧+D : Pop up the Desktop folder

A: ctrl+F2: Access the menu via the keyboard (Windows alt+space equivalent).

A: Typing / on any file dialog will give you a "go to folder" dialog, which autocompletes with tab (you have to wait a second for it to work). This lets you type in the full path, from the root / folder.
Extra handy if you want to open from / save to hidden locations or already have the command line path you want to save something in.
This can be also accessed via ~ (i.e. the tilde key, to start from your home directory, e.g. ~/Documents) or using cmd+shift+G (which starts with the most recently entered directory).

A: While being in the application switcher (using ⌘+⇥) cycle to an application by pressing ⇥ or ⇧+⇥; then - while still holding down ⌘ - press the down arrow to see an expose view of the selected app´s windows, including minimized windows. Using the arrow keys navigate to a window you want to bring to the foreground and hit ← to select it.

A: Holding down the ⌥ while booting to select the startup volume.
Holding down C while booting to boot from a CD/DVD in the drive.

A: In a text area:
Command ⌘ + → the end of the line (like End)
Command ⌘ + ← the beginning of the line (like Home)
Option ⌥ + → jump forward one word
Option ⌥ + ← jump back one word  

A: ⌘+space: activate spotlight.
Then you can launch any application, open most files, do quick calculations, etc.

A: ⌘+W: Close window (or tab).
⌘+⌥+W: Close all windows.

A: ⌘+⇧+4: selective screenshot saved on desktop
⌘+⇧+ctrl+4: selective screenshot  saved in clipboard

A: ⌘+⇧+.: show/hide hidden files on any file dialog

A: ⌘+⇧+4+space+click on a window copies the current window to the desktop.
This is very useful while taking screenshots without the need to crop. The rounded edges stay rounded.
Use this with ctrl to copy the image to the clipboard.

A: ⌘+⇥: Cycle through running apps
⌘+`: Cycle through windows for current app
⌘+W: Close current window
⌘+Q: Quit current app

Ctrl+⌘+⏏: restart the computer
Ctrl+⌥+⌘-⏏: shut down the computer
⌘+⌥+⏏: puts the computer in sleep mode
⇧+Ctrl+⏏: puts the monitor in sleep mode

A: Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + Esc ⎋ brings up the force quit dialog, which is handy for killing unresponsive applications.

Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧ + Esc ⎋ held down for 5 seconds kills the foremost application.

A: ctrl+⌥+⌘+8: High contrast theme.
⌘+` (backtick): Cycle through app's windows.

A: ⌘+⇧+N: Create a new folder in Finder

A: ⌘+⌥+H: hide all inactive application windows
This is great for focusing on a single task or works well as a kind of show desktop if you switch to Finder first (providing you have few or no windows open)

A: All of the shortcuts are my favorite!
Specifically (based on frequency of use) ⌘+H: Hide application

A: ⌘+⇥:  Cycle through applications.
⌘+`:  Cycle through the current application's windows.
⇥: Auto fill commands and file/directory names in Terminal.
⌘+⇧+4: Take a screenshot of a selected area.
⌘+⇧+3: Take a screenshot of the whole screen.

A: ⌘+C:  Copy selection  
⌘+V: Paste selection  
⌘+X: Cut selection

A: fn+F3: show all windows (in the current Space)
fn+⌘+F3: show the desktop
fn+ctrl+F3: show the "current application" windows
fn+⌥+F3: show the Exposé preference pane

A: ⌘+alt+shift+V   pastes plain text, SUPER useful for copying from web pages or MS Word into email, and leaving the weird formatting behind.

A: Not wholly keyboard shortcut, but holding down the Option key (⌥) and bringing up a system menu often provides extensive information. For instance if you are connected to wifi, hold down ⌥ and clicking on the network menu will bring up a lot of information (MAC address, IP address, signal strength, et c.) about the current network connection.
Holding ⌥ and clicking on the notification icon also sets your notification status to "Do not disturb"---rather useful when discussing something on your screen with colleagues and you don't want to see Messages popping up.

A: ctrl+⌘+1 to order files by name (icon view)

A: Zoom shortcuts, very good for presentations:
fn+⌥+⌘+8: turn on/off zoom
fn+⌥+⌘+=: zoom in
fn+⌥+⌘+-: zoom out

A: On newer keyboards, invoke Exposé to


*

*fn+F3: show all windows (in the current Space)

*fn+⌘+F3: show the desktop

*fn+ctrl+F3: show the "current application" windows

*fn+⌥+F3: show the Exposé preference pane


While being in Exposé, 


*

*cycle through windows with the arrow keys, using return to bring them into focus.

*use ⇥ and  ⇧+ ⇥ to cycle through windows by applications (as highlighted in the Dock)


A: ctrl+← or ctrl+→ to move between Mission Control spaces (in Lion).

A: ctrl+⇥ Cycles through tabs in a web browser going to the right.  
ctrl+⇧+⇥ Cycles through tabs in a web browser going to the left. 
⌘+↓ Goes to the very bottom of a web page or textarea.
⌘+↑  Goes to the very top of a web page or textarea.  

A: In Finder, ⌥+⌘+P brings up the full path. If you then hit ⌘+C in Finder, you can paste the full path of a file or folder into your Terminal or elsewhere by ⌘+V.

A: ⌘+z [undo] is my favorite & the one I tell the people I support to remember if they only learn one shortcut. 
In Finder it undoes the last operation you just performed from inadvertently beginning to rename a file or folder; or undoing an unintentional drag and drop of a file or folder into the wrong folder or undoing a move to trash operation.
In applications many have multiple levels of undo which lets you step backward undoing previous edits or draws. Extremely useful in extricating yourself from sticky situations or just after having made a simple mistake.

A: control+shift+L   turn the lights off
