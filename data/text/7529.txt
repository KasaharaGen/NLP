Q: Prevent iPhone from charging while connected to MacBook I want to know if is there a way to prevent my iPhone battery from charging,  when I connect it to my MacBook. 
I want to try my applications when I'm working, but I'm afraid that I will damage the iPhone battery.

A: You won't damage the battery.  Your phone will be fine.

A: Perhaps try it plugged into a unpowered USB hub? I can't guarantee it will help, but it might work.
