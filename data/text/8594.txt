Is there a way to add shortcuts to open a particular folder in Save Dialogs and Finder Windows? 

Is it possible to set custom shortcut keys for finder, for example at the moment we have CMD+Shift+A to go to Applications, could finder be programmed to CMD+Shift+S for sites for example?

A: I believe the only way to do this is by using a third party utility. You will need an app where you can assign an applescript to a shortcut. A few examples of these apps :
FastScripts

Alfred

You would then create an Applescript/Bash script that will open that folder and assign the shortcut to run that script.
