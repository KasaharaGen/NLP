Q: typewriter effect to keyboard stroke Is there any way to add (sound) typewriter effect to keyboard stroke?

A: Here is a link to an article that explains how to do this natively (without any 3rd party applications).
And here is an app - Typewriter Keyboard - that makes it sound authentically like a typewriter.
Hope this helps.
