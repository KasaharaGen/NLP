Q: How can I really disable the Cmd to Win key mapping in Parallels Desktop 5? Removed it from System Preferences > Keyboard. No go.
Remapped ⌘ Cmd to be Ctrl. No go.
Ripping out the ⌘ Cmd key shouldn't be the solution. Anyone?...

A: It works for me, but I have it remapped like this: 

So cmd is really control for Windows. 

A: I found that mapping a different key to the Win command did not remove the Cmd key being mapped to Win.  What worked for me was to map Cmd to Shift.

All the other shortcuts such as Cmd + S (save), Cmd + C (copy), etc still worked but hitting Cmd by itself now just activates the Shift key which really does nothing by itself.

A: Go to Parallels Desktop preferences and disable key mapping for key which behaves abnormally ("Cmd > win" in our case) as shown on the screenshot below:


A: You can use Krumstick to remap the windows key inside Windows.

A: Not sure if this will help you. But the main problem for me was the CMD + arrow keys I use all the time to go to the start or end of a line. 
This can be remapped without problems, this way you can use all your normal shortcuts from MacOS too. The second I get a Mac keyboard muscle memory kicks in and this is a good compromise :)
