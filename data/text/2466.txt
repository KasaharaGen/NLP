Q: My old voice memos don't sync via iTunes I have switched computer which I'm using to sync with my iPhone 3Gs. The problem is that all my old voice memos aren't added to my iTunes library, but they're still on the iPhone. 
So I wonder how do fix so I can get all my voice memos to sync with iTunes?

A: Voice memo's didn't sync like music with older versions of iTunes. With any current version of iTunes it should sync properly.
I doubt that this question is still active, but for future problems I've added an answer.
