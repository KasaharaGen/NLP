Q: How can I share apps and music purchased on one apple ID between 7 devices? I have:


*

*1 Macbook Pro for office use

*1 Macbook Air for personal travel use

*1 Mac Mini to run my home theater system

*1 iMac that my wife and kids use

*1 iPad v1 for the kids to play with

*1 iPad v2 for myself

*1 iPhone 3GS


I'm running into problems with iTunes telling me I've authorized too many devices. I have seen in some places people saying that I'm allowed to authorized up to 10 devices, 5 of which can be computers, but iTunes seems to be treating computers and other devices the same for me, limiting me to 5 no matter what.
Any ideas what might be wrong?

A: Maybe you have authorized Macs you no longer have.
Go to your account in iTunes, under Apple ID Overview you can see how many computers you have authorized and (once a year) you can deauthorize all, after that you should be able to reauthorize your Macs. (This does not affect iOS devices, as they do not count towards your 5 devices limit)
