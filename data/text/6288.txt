Q: Is there an OS X equivalent to the web debugging proxy Fiddler? I do web development on Windows for my day job, and I rely a lot on Fiddler, which is web debugging proxy.  What is an equivalent tool for OS X?

A: These are both free and haven't been mentioned so far.  I found that both of these are far superior to the X11 Wireshark.

*Cocoa Packet Analyzer

*Packet Peeper

A: http://mitmproxy.org/ is text-based tool, but does a great job.  For any http-speaking app you want to analyse, and even modify and replay requests.

A: Fiddler now has an Alpha build based on Mono.  

A: Stuff that's Free:


*

*Burp Suite 

*WiireShark

*ParosProxy

*NetTool

*LiveHTTPHeaders

*Safari WebInspector Network Tab

*FireBug
Stuff that Costs:


*

*$1.99 -  HTTPClient

*$15.00 - HTTP Scoop

*$50.00 - CharlesProxy

A: I use CharlesProxy, and while it isn't as scriptable as Fiddler, it does the job. And with single license key, you can run it on all OSes (it's written in Java).
My needs were little different when I needed it ... I used it to debug webdav connections or to debug http communication between servers.

A: If you just want to see HTTP traffic, try Cellist.

A: Try Tamper
It's a Chrome extension that lets you view and modify HTTP requests in the current tab's scope

A: Try Proxyman, which is exclusively built for macOS.

*

*Easy to use and set up the certificates on mac/iOS/Android

*All advanced tools: Map Local, Map Remote, Breakpoint, Scripting, ...

*Active development and bug/feature tracker

*It's a premium app without time limit

Disclaimer: I'm a creator of Proxyman. Just come here to suggest a better alternative to boost productivity. Hope you enjoy the app!

A: ZAP Attack proxy from OWASP is an excellent OpenSource alternative.
The already mentioned Burp is also excellent but the paid version is much better than the free version.
I use both for work.

A: Captor, available on mac app store
It's a native app , can capture HTTP/HTTPS just like CharlesProxy.

A: There's a mac version now via mono.
