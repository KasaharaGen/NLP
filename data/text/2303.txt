Q: How to point an Apple TV to an iTunes Library on a NAS? I have my Apple TV linked to my iTunes library stored on a network storage device by linking to my laptop. I would like to point my Apple TV directly to the iTunes library on the storage device without linking through the laptop. Is there an easy way to do this?

A: (Assuming you have an Apple TV 2â€¦) You can't do it without jailbreaking.
Once you do that, you just need to run Plex or XBMC. I only have experience with the former, but we're very happy with the results.

A: This cannot be done with a standard AppleTV.  It may be possible with a jailbroken Apple TV or if you put something like XBMC onto it.
