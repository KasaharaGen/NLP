Q: How to make preview jump to a specific line on startup I am using TexLipse for working with latex, producing pdfs as output. I have configured it to use preview as viewer using this command line:
open -a "/Applications/Preview.app" %fullfile

Where %fullfile is the name of the file to be opened. TexLipse supports the adding of a %line argument, that can be passed to the viewer to make it jump to the position where the cursor in the editor is at. However, I could not find a way or any documentation on how to pass that argument to preview. Can anyone explain how to achieve this? Is it even possible?

A: If you are working with LaTeX, you should use Skim.app not Preview.app
Skim has support for moving bi-directionally between LaTeX source and the PDF, to a specific line in either the source or PDF file.

A: Not possible with Preview. It can go to a specific page, but that's as close as you can get. And I doubt that's baked into the CL access.
You can get the free Adobe Reader for Mac here. It must be able to do this...

A: It is possible with Preview.app but it wasn't designed for this so it is a bit of a hack.
Turn on GUI scripting, then make a script that simulates pressing the down arrow, then call that script n times.
