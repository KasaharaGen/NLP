Q: How to activate mod_rewrite on MacOSX Lion I tried to activate the mod_rewrite module in the httpd.conf, but I do not succeed to make it work.
I'm running Lion, and my goal is to do URL rewriting in ~USER/Sites/mysite
Can someone help me please?

A: You need to add a conf file to the following dir
/etc/apache2/users/yourname.conf
<Directory "/Users/yourname/Sites/">
     Options Indexes MultiViews
     AllowOverride All
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from All
</Directory>
