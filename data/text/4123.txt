Q: What is default (factory pre-loaded) iOS for iPhone 3gs I was so happy with my iphone when I bought it. It was so fast... now, after dozen of upgrades i hate my iphone....
does anyone remember what was the original version of iOS when they bought their 3GS

A: The 3GS originally shipped with iOS 3.0, which was called iPhone OS 3.0 at the time.

A: The 3GS is still available for sale today, and it ships with the latest version of iOS 4 pre-installed.
The 3GS was launched within a few days of iOS 3.0's launch, so for a long time it was sold with that pre-installed.
So the answer depends on when you bought your phone. But it should not be slow with the latest version of iOS. I know several people running iOS 4 on their 3GS without any problems.

A: Some iPhone 3GSs even come with iOS 5 preinstalled. Before that, the 8 gb models would come with iOS 4 installed. Before that, they came with iOS 3. That's the list of preinstalled iOSs. The 16 and 32 gig models only came with iOS 3. Sadly, they were discontinued on September 12th , 2012.
