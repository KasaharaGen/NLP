Q: Is there an alternative App to Mail on iPad? I'm looking for another app than Mail on my iPad. I have searched the appStore without success.
Is there not other emailers on iPad ?

A: A solution would be to use Gmail web app and add it to the dashboard.
The iPad web interface is pretty nice, I believe it works offline, too. One of the main problem is that there's no new mail notification.

A: If you are using Gmail then have a look at:


*

*Inbox2

*Mailing Desk
Inbox2 even lets you integrate your conversations from other webapps (twitter, facebook, linkdin), if that is something relevant for you.
