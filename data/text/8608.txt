Q: Apple's iCloud SMTP Server For Old Devices Does Not Work I have set up my iPod Touch 1G to use the iCloud mail servers as per http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4864. IMAP works, but SMTP, although it worked for the first ~24 hours, refuses to work, complaining that the username or password is incorrect. I tried manually using this SMTP server on my Mac (Lion 10.7.2) and it gives the same result. Is anyone able to send emails via smtp.mail.me.com or has anyone experienced this problem and has a fix for it?
EDIT: I have checked with a new iCloud account (set up on 4th Nov) and it works, so if anyone else has this issue it is a problem with your account. AppleCare, get ready!

A: Well it recently started working, so let's hope it stays that way!

A: Hmm... I wasn't aware that it was possible to use this service on earlier iOS version & hardware models. The iCloud SMTP server (at least on iOS 5) uses an authentication token specifically from Apple.
