Q: I need a delete button I also have an azerty keyboard, but am used to the qwerty and I want to know how I can modify the keyboard to have a "delete" function. Deleting using the backspace is laborious and I miss being able to delete from the front of the text. Any ideas? 

A: If you have an Apple keyboard: fn-Backspace is a substitute for Delete. Depending on the application Ctrl-D works as well.

A: you can use KeyRemap4MacBook to remap CapsLock to delete.
