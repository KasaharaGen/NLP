Q: How do I recover a deleted file from an iPod Touch running OS 4.1 How do I recover a deleted file from an iPod Touch running OS 4.1?

A: Unless you have a recent enough backup in iTunes, you can't. But if you do have a recent backup in iTunes, you'll have to do a full restore (by clicking the "Restore" button in iTunes) to get the file back.
