Q: Windows taskbar in Parallels VM I'm running Windows 7 in Coherance mode in Parrellels desktop, and have the task bar visible at the bottom of the screen.

Is it possible to move the task bar down, behind the Mac Dock, without turning on Dock hiding?
Like this:


A: As far as I know, you cannot, because the dock tells the window server to reduce the windows max height to : screen height - dock current unmagnified size. 
So the taskbar (which is in a window), is automatically placed on top on the dock.
