Q: How do I automatically reconnect to wifi when the connection is lost? I'm on OS X 10.6. When I'm downloading a torrent, the connection is sometimes lost.
And because of this, the download stops too, and the only solution I found to reconnect is to manually turn off the WiFi and turn it back on.
Is there a program or trick to restore the network connection automatically? 

A: While this doesn't solve your problem immediately, I can say that I had the exact same issue with my iMac and OS X 10.6. My solution? Get a new router. From that point on, the wireless connection was far more stable, and while the issue itself exists (say I make a lot of changes in the router that requires the connection to drop -- my iMac won't always reconnect), the router itself seems to make a big deal in the connectivity. (I went after one of the newer N routers; my previous router was a G router.)
Other things to try (before shelling out $$$):


*

*Make sure your router's firmware is up-to-date (Mine was, unfortunately)

*See if you can install a custom firmware (like DD-WRT) that might solve the problem (this is really dependent upon router type, so not all routers are supported)


A: This will do it
just replace  with your network name
#!/bin/bash

# turn on wifi if it's turned 'Off'
if [ $(networksetup -getairportpower en1 | grep -c 'Off') = '1' ]
then $(networksetup -setairportpower en1 on)
fi

# cycle wifi power if missing 'IP address'
if [ $(networksetup -getinfo Wi-Fi | grep -c 'IP address:') = '1' ]
then $(networksetup -setairportpower en1 off; network setup -setairportpower en1 on)
fi

# initiate connection if not connected to the correct network
if [ $(networksetup -getairportnetwork en1 | grep -c '<networkName>') = 0]
then $(networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 '<networkName>')
fi
