Q: How do I uninstall Xcode? I now have two versions of Xcode installed:


*

*Xcode 4 - installed in /Developer (bought from Mac App Store)

*Xcode 3 - installed in /Developer-old (I believe it was installed from the second disc supplied with my MCB)


Since I don't use either of those at the moment, how can I completely remove both?
Would removing both folder just do the job?
What about associated Library stuff?

A: Xcode comes with an uninstaller. Just run
sudo <Xcode directory>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all
