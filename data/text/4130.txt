Q: using gcc, g++ outside of xcode on mac I'd like to spend some time aside from the IDE for a bit and use command line gcc, g++ compilers.
When i use my terminal, they however, can't be found. 
How can i install them?
I honestly am surprised why these two don't come standard.
Please let me know.

A: If you have not already done so, you should install the development tools that come with your Mac in one of the OS discs, which include gcc. So gcc and other such programs are standard, but not installed by default (I suppose the thinking behind this choice is that either one does not need them and won't miss them, or he won't have no trouble in installing them when needed).
