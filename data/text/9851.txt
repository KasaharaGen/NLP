A: These icons are located at:

/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/


A: They are located in an Apple Asset Catalog proprietary .car archive format at:

/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/Assets.car

There are also other .car files in that folder with icon images for various system display settings.
You can browse and export images from the Assets.car file by using the AssetCatalogTinkerer tool:
