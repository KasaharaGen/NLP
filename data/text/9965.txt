Q: Are there other options for reducing glare on a MacBook Pro? I'm discouraged that for those of us wanting matte displays, we have to get a pretty crummy looking white-gray border around the screen rather than the sleek black edge that normal MacBook Pros come with:

Is there a way to get a matte display without having to get the terrible-looking edge? Could I buy a regular MacBook and use some commercial screen overlay which would give the same effect without compromising the black edge?

A: I once saw someone using a sort of matte finish film on their MacBook display which seemed pretty effective.
It was something like the item in this review
Looks like you'd have to be very careful when applying it.

A: There are lots of options a simple Google search for Macbook screen protector brings up many sheets of anit-glare plastic that can be applied over the screen in the same way as an iPhone protector.

Is one of the first page hits, it is UK based though.

A: I have one of these on my glossy 15" MacBook Pro and love it. I use the same film on my iPhone 4S (and have used it previously on iPhone 4 and iPhone 3G with great success).
