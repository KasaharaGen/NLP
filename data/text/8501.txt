Q: What is the macOS equivalent to Window's AppData folder? I was originally looking for my Google Chrome profile because something went wrong and I need to delete it. In the process I realized that I don't know where applications in general are putting this kind of stuff.
Where is the typical place to go looking?

A: This kind of data is frequently stored in ~/Library/Application Support.
User-specific settings are frequently stored in ~/Library/Preferences
Your Chrome profile is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default.
I recommend going on a little exploration of the ~/Library folder; there's a lot of useful stuff in there.

A: I had this happen and I fixed the problem by relogging in to Google Sync.
The profile file is stored in:
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default
Usually an application will install data in /Library/Preferences/ and/or ~/Library/Preferences/.
Data can also be placed after any of the following patterns:
/Library/Preferences/<application name>/
~/Library/Preferences/<application name>/
/Library/Application Support/<application name>/
~/Library/Application Support/<application name>/͏͏͏͏
/Library/<application name>/
~/Library/<application name>/ ͏͏͏͏
