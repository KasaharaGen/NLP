Q: VMware Fusion 2.x not running with 64 Bit Kernel Lion has anyone managed to run fusion 2.x under Mac OS Lion? Since the update it says 
Incompatibility with 64 bit kernel
This release of VMware Fusion does not work with 64-bit kernel of Mac OS X, you are currently running.
To use VMware Fusion, you must restart your computer using the 32-bit kernel of Mac OS X again.
Any ideas :( ?

A: Upgrade to VMWare Fusion 3.1 which is compatible with Lion, with limited support from VMWare.
VMWare's knowledge base says

VMware Fusion 3.1.3 was designed for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and OS X 10.6
  (Snow Leopard). It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), with the
  limitations listed below.
If you are running an older version of VMware Fusion, upgrade to
  VMware Fusion 3.1.3 before upgrading to Lion. Fusion 2.x is
  incompatible with Lion.


A: VMware have said that Fusion 2.0 is incompatible with Lion.

Version 3 on the other hand, does offer Lion support.
Note also that the latest version of freeware Virtual Box is also Lion compatible.
