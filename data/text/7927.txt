Q: Can the iPad 2 be used for everyday telephony? Is it possible to use the iPad 2 as a kind of oversized mobile phone for everyday use?


*

*Using the 3G functionality available in some models?

*Using VoIP through WLAN?

*Using other means? 

*With or without additional gadgets like headsets


and I mean not just theoretically possible, but really feasible with decent audio quality and a pleasant experience even for long calls. 
Does anybody have experience with this?

A: There are numerous possibilities outside Skype.
First; the iPad fully supports the three ring headset that Apple sells. Both the stock Apple Earphones that ship with every iPhone, and even the Apple In-Ear Headphones. Meaning that you can use third ring microphone for any/all input methods. And, of course, all iPads have built-in speakers and microphones, so you can even use it in a "Speaker Phone" style of use.
If you have access to a Asterisk or similar SIP PBX server, then you have access to a myriad of Softphone applications, many of which are very capable and support all the latest features (namely backgrounding) including 3G calling where applicable. Take a gander at AppShopper.com's list of results when searching for "softphone".
While not an official recommendation because I haven't used it personally, I do give a nod to Counterpath's Bria app, because I've used Counterpath's SIP clients on the desktop for years.

A: As long as you restrict yourself to Skype it might just work. The recent Skype update brought Bluetooth support so you could just use a headset to make phone calls. 
Ordinary phone calls are not possible though, even on the 3G models (they only support data connections).
