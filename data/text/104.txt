Q: Can I mirror my iPad's display using the VGA adapter for use in a presentation? I would love to be able to mirror the display of my iPad on a projector for use in a presentation. Is there any software available to do this - on the AppStore or if necessary for use with a jailbroken iPad?

A: There's no official way to achieve this.
You have to jailbreak your iPad and use a software like DisplayOut (works on all iDevices) to do this.

A: Just for clarification: 
With the iPad2, every app is mirrored on the VGA adapter by default, without any additional measures.

A: As Studer mentioned, there is no official way to do so. you can use the DisplayOut software for Jailbroken iPads.
If you're more developer oriented, there is also 
this option
