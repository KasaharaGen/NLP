Q: Permanently pair Mac with iPhone I have paired a new Macbook Air with my iPhone, however after the Mac is rebooted, it asks me to confirm pairing. Is this a bug in Lion, or can it be permanently paired?
Similar issue with a mouse, but solution didn't help me
Steps to reproduce


*

*Set up Bluetooth device, find iPhone, pair while having iPhone on the hotspot screen

*Disconnect and connect to device. Works fine.

*Reboot Mac

*Connect to the device from the Bluetooth menu


Dialog pops up asking for me to confirm pin. If iPhone is in hotspot screen, it will also pop-up a dialog. I have to tap pair on iPhone then it's back to normal. After that it works until next reboot.

About system:


*

*OSX 10.7.1

*tried iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4

*macbook air (mid-2011)
