Q: Using ffmpeg on MOV files created by iMovie It looks like ffmpeg will not work with MOV files created using iMovie. Is there a way to batch convert these files (which are HUGE) to a compressed format, preferably mp4? I've also tried HandBrake with no success (though I assume ffmpeg is under the hood).

A: You may try MPEG StreamClip also. There is Batch mode â€” cmd+b
But it's hard to tell based on your information why Handbrake was not able to help you.

A: There's also Video Monkey (although it uses ffmpeg under the hood), but if HandBrake doesn't work for you, I doubt it will as well.
