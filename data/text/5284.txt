Q: Does the Lion App Store have a debug menu? I like using the debug menu on the Snow Leopard App Store app by enabling it with 


*

*defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true

Does the same toggle work on the Lion version of the app?

A: The debug menu is available in the Lion app store, with the same command as you posted.

I don't see any other hidden prefs of interest:
NSWindow Frame Preferences" = "-1 53 1289 1005 0 0 1920 1058 ";
ShowDebugMenu = 1;
WebKitUserStyleSheetEnabledPreferenceKey = 1;
availableUpdates =     (
    );
