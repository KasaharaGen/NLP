Q: Multiple skype instances on iphone Is is possible to run multiple instances of skype client on an iphone.
I would like to be able to to login to two separate skype accounts and have the run simultaneously. 
Is it possible?
For instance, if there was an unofficial skype client, I could install it along the official one with different user name.

A: Not possible with the official Skype App. 
Running unofficial Skype client is possible, but recently Skype changed the rules and pushed out third parties, running Skype gateways (like Fring).
