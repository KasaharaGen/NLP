Q: Subversion 1.7 for OS X Lion I am quite lost, how do I get this to work. I can't find any GUI Programs that support 1.7 yet. Commandline would be okay, but I can't seem to find one!
Also how would the diff work on the commandline?

A: Macports has a subversion port. Others are listed on the subversion download page which includes Wandisco which seems to have a GUI.
