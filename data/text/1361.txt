Q: Caffeine taking up 2.88GB virtual memory 
Caffeine is a small program. Why is it taking up so much virtual memory or am I reading this wrong?
Edit: persists across application and os restarts

A: So apparently I was reading it wrong. According to Thomas Franz√©n ( lightheadsw )

Virtual memory size is a meaningless
  number for most uses. An application
  having a big virtual memory size
  doesn't affect you, because it's just
  a virtual memory space. The column you
  should be looking at is RSIZE. That's
  the actual amount of physical RAM an
  application is using.

I verified with ObjectAlloc and it seems like it is using only 8MB or so.


A: On my machine, it's using 30.2 MB, so you're right that yours is doing something out of the ordinary.
When you reboot, does it start at a lower number, or immediately jump to this level?
Do you usually have it clicked? (I don't)
Is it adding any messages to your console log?
What version of Caffeine are you running?
