Q: How to enable Syntax highlighting on Vim in Mac OS Terminal? Is there a way to let Vim on Mac OS highlighten syntax of different languages in Terminal? I would guess for vim it is a .vimrc thing, right? (But I cannot find this file in my home folder).

A: If the file ~/.vimrc is not there, you'll just need to create it. To enable syntax highlighting, add
syntax on

to it. Also make sure that "Display ANSI colors" is enabled in the Terminal Settings.

A: You most probably want to enable indentation along with syntax highlighting, so add these to lines to ~/.vimrc
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on
