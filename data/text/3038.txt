Q: Mount & unmount volume notifications For the last month or so, I have been receiving notification windows in the upper right-hand corner whenever a volume is mounted or unmounted (i.e. portable hard drive, Time Machine, etc.) How do I turn these notifications off?

A: If Growl is installed and you want to turn off just the notifications for volume mounts and dismounts (as opposed to getting rid of Growl altogether):


*

*System Preferences, Growl panel

*Applications tab

*Select HardwareGrowler from the list

*Configure

*Notifications tab

*In the dropdown, for each notification (e.g. Volume Mounted) you want to disable:

*Select it and untick the 'Enabled' box.


(Edit:) Or, as fnurl points out, remove HG entirely.
I find it useful enough to keep, but tweaked to my liking.  It alerts me if my WiFi starts bouncing, f/ex.  YMMV, as always.

A: Check to see if you have Growl installed - it will be in System Preferences. Sometimes applications install it without your permission - even though the growl team explicitly don't allow it. Its safe though, I use and love the product.  

A: I use HardwareGrowler to get these messages.
Perhaps HardwareGrowler is launching at startup? If you do not want this, go to
System Preferences → Accounts → Your Account → Login items
and find HardwareGrowler and remove it from the list.
