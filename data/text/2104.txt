Q: How do I type š on an international keyboard? I'm currently writing emails frequently to a Slovenian who has the letter š in his name. I use copy and paste for the letter š, which is quite inconvenient.
I'm using the US keyboard layout.
How can I type this letter directly from the keyboard?

A: Right Option (Alt) v s
You must have U.S. Extended keyboard layout enabled for the above to work.

A: You can choose edit menu (in most software)  then choose Special Character .. then go to Accented Latin tab and find your character Š.


A: Simply hold down the S key and you'll be presented with three options - press 3 on your keyboard to type š. If you need a capital Š just use the Shift Key or Caps Lock.

A: If you have the patience to configure the keybindings, you can try Ukelele and create a keyboard layout for your needs.

A: I'm not near my iMac right now, so I can't test this. But this usually works for me http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8504.html

A: I have long had the same problem. My solution: install the Slovenian keyboard layout and set the shortcut to changing between keyboards to Option+Tab. That works very quickly and gives you all the special letters (they are in place of the paranthesis and quotation keys on an English keyboard.)
