Q: How to set a default Calendar in iCal 10.7.2 Since I activated iCloud, iCal has changed the default calendar to new events to one which I do not want to use.
How can I change the default calendar for iCal? I cannot find a setting!

A: This is in iCal's preferences:
Preferences > General > Default Calendar.
This enables the default calendar to be set.
