Q: What iPad apps are available that support handwriting recognition? What iPad apps are available that support handwriting recognition?
Are there any good iPad apps for taking notes that can recognize handwriting?

A: You might like to checkout Writepad - it sounds like it does pretty much everything you are asking. I've used it before, and found it worked pretty well. It's only $4.99US at the moment as well, so maybe a good time to give it  a go.
I also use Plecodict which is an English-Chinese dictionary, which has handwriting recognition for learning new characters (and an optical recognition mode as well) - just mentioning it because you didn't specify a certain language.
Good luck.

A: WritePad is definitely a good option. PhatPad, from the same publisher (Phatware), also does it, along with standard keyboard input and some drawing capability.
