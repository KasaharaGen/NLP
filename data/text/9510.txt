Q: How do I full-screen QuickTime Player on an external monitor in Lion? I am trying to play a QuickTime video in Lion on an external monitor. How do I get it to play full screen on the external monitor, not on the laptop screen?

A: Install QT 7 from http://support.apple.com/kb/dl923 and open your movie with QT7. Then open Preferences and select Fullscreen tab and click on your second display.
Update:
Movist is a great player. You can get it from here: http://code.google.com/p/movist/

A: Move the non-fullscreen QuickTime window to the external monitor, then click the fullscreen button.
Sorry, just tested and that doesn't work. It used to, not sure when that changed.
It's not a proper solution, but using VLC would be a workable stopgap measure - it doesn't use the built-in Lion fullscreen functionality, and thus can be put wherever you like, and doesn't blank the other screens at the same time.

A: The only way I can see fullscreen playing on a non-primary display (without editing System Preferences or adding additional software) is this: 


*

*select movie file in Finder

*activate Quick Look (click the eye button or press space bar)

*move the Quick Look window over to the target display

*click the "expand to fullscreen" arrows button in its top right corner.


QuickTime Player Version 10.1 (501.8) on Lion - the Quick Look hack only works on non-streamed content so it is kind of a bummer. I seriously hope that Apple fixes this in a software update soon :-/
