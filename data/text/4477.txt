Q: Get default ruby back I'm in the process of setting up my Ruby on Rails development environment and part of that was playing around with RVM. I screwed up a bit though because I deleted the /usr/local/bin/ruby which was required for homebrew. 
How can I get that version of ruby back at this point?
