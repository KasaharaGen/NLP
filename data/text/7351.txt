Q: Good Video Editing Software, around $100? I'm looking for some Video Editing software that allows me to


*

*Have more than one video track, so I can do Picture-in-Picture, cross-fades etc.

*Read AVCHD and AVCHD Lite

*Have good options for synchronizing video and audio

*Have a few limited options to cut audio and take parts of audio, just so that background tracks can be made to fit

*Export into at least one standard format, be it uncompressed so that I can do it later

*Compatible with Lion


Usually, Final Cut Pro X would come into mind now, but it's $300. In the Windows world, there's stuff like Pinnacle Systems Studio, but I don't know what's available on a Mac and what doesn't totally "suck" ("Consumer" Products that are limited, naggy and otherwise just a cash grab)

A: Just FYI, I bit the bullet and went with Final Cut Pro X in the end.

A: Check out Openshot â€” It's free and quite powerful; it's definitely one of the best. Another one you might look at trying is Mediaedit ($40), which isn't bad for the price. In my opinion FCPX is not much better than iMovie currently; Actually iMovie might be better.

A: I would recommend getting FCE 4, if you can find it. I was able to get it for $50 from a friend. The one thing I haven't figured out is how to export nicely from FCE. I think I may have solved it by getting the $50 Compressor from Apple. I highly recommend the editing part fo FCE, but I'm not so sure about the exporting. I know there's a way; I just haven't figured it out.
EDIT: FCE 4 is just fine when you export using Export>Export to QT, then drop it into Compressor.
