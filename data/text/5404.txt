Q: Is there a clipboard manager/app with a searchable history/pasteboard? So far I only know of Clyppan and Alfred but clyppan is only available as a paid app from the App Store and Alfred only offers its clipboard feature with a pay-for upgrade

A: How about Clip Menu?
This seems to cover all your requirements and is free.
