Q: Disable a user's ability to unlock a FileVault 2 volume at startup/login time I recently performed a clean install of Lion on one of my Macs. The installation process created one administrative user account. After installation, I enabled FileVault for the entire disk. Then, I created an additional administrative user. Both users are able to decrypt the drive during login.
How would I revoke decryption rights to one of the users without deleting the user or temporarily disabling FileVault? I have tried revoking one user's administrative privilege, making them a regular user, but they are still able to decrypt the drive during boot.

A: It is not impossible. (Although if you have deleted user you may have made this more complicated!)
I wrote the article 'jaydisc' linked to and just tested that it still works in 10.7.4:
Assume that you have an admin user 'charlie' that you want to be able to use, but not unlock, the computer:
sudo su - charlie  
$ passwd 
Changing password for charlie.
Old Password:**[enter old password here]**
New Password:**[press enter]**
Retype New Password:**[press enter]**
$ 

Note that you cannot do this:
sudo passwd charlie
Changing password for charlie.
New password:

because if you press enter when you get the 'new password prompt' it will come back and say:
Password unchanged.


A: Use fdesetup:
sudo fdesetup remove -user username

See: http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/using-fdesetup-with-mountain-lions-filevault-2/

A: It looks like temporarily removing the users' passwords removes them from the EFI boot menu:

Unfortunately, in my case, some of the users are Open Directory Mobile users, and I am unable to find out a way to set their password to empty.

A: FileVault 2 and Recovery HD
Recovery HD not to be confused with the Recovery OS (one is greater than the other). 
When you enable FileVault 2 for a user: the non-encrypted hidden Apple_Boot Recovery HD partition, separate from but critical to the encrypted startup volume, is temporarily mounted for writes to EFI-related and other files. If you wish to view this file system activity, whilst enabling a user for unlock purposes: 


*

*before clicking Done, use a command such as fs_usage or an application such as fseventer.  


A glance at the activity suggests that edits to the non-encrypted volume — in relation to the user account on the encrypted volume — are nontrivial. 
If a user is given inappropriate authority to unlock
Maybe an update to Lion (something greater than Build 11A511) will provide a way to remove, from the EFI loginwindow, a user who should no longer be able to unlock the startup volume. 
In the meantime I can think of only two methods that may be used. 
Method A: disable then enable FileVault


*

*disable FileVault 2

*allow backward conversion to complete

*restart the operating system

*enable FileVault 2, but not for that user. 
Method B: remove the user but not the home directory, et cetera
I have not tested this method, I imagine that the following might work: 


*

*backup

*remove the user but not the user's home directory

*restart the operating system

*create a new user with the same RecordName as the original

*set a UniqueID number that differs from the original

*associate the previous home directory with the new user. 

A: Here is the very simple answer on how to disable a previously enabled user's access to a FileVault 2 encrypted drive:
In terminal, use:
sudo fdesetup remove -user Username

You will see thereafter the disabled user in the list of users that are available for enabling in System Preferences->Security & Privacy -> FileVault as verification that the disabling was successful
