Q: Use Apple Wireless Keyboard for PC and Mac I need a wireless keyboard and mouse that I can switch between my MacBook Pro and PC.
I was looking at the Apple Wireless Keyboard, but I'm not sure if I can change from PC to Mac usage easily enough.
Does anyone have a similar setup?

A: As per Bluetooth functionality, one would have to pair/unpair with the chosen device to switch to another system. It's worth noting that Apple by no means supports PC's to work with their accessories, and a quick search will show you plenty of people having a less-than-stellar experience trying to make it work. A more appropriate long-term solution is a wired keyboard and a KVM to switch between systems.

A: The Bluetooth Apple Wireless Keyboard is able to be connected and used with a Win PC as long as the Win PC supports bluetooth.
