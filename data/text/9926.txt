Q: Macbook 3,1 (2007 White Model) works slow and lags For the past year my Macbook has be getting slower, lauder and lags constantly...
The lags range from switching spaces to changing a language or even typing an input.
It almost never craches, but it does seem like his age is catching up to him...
I have tried formatting it completely already. I bought it with Leopard, and went through Snow Leopard to Lion. It got this way before the Lion installation (which I hoped would help), and now after completely reformatting my into Lion, it took only a few days for it to come back to this condition.
What can I do to make my Mac work right again?
