Q: How do I connect the location of a calendar event with the iPad maps app? I would like to be able to either navigate from a calendar event to its location within maps, or view all upcoming events on a map. Preferably, both. 
How do I connect the location of a calendar event with the iPad maps app?

A: Sadly, (as of iOS 4), this cannot be done. The location field of an event does not recognise an address, no matter how perfectly you enter it.
[UPDATE] In iOS 5, the location field in any calendar event will (if properly formatted) hyperlink to the Maps app.

A: It wouldn't be a perfect solution, but you could try pasting in a maps.google.com link into you calendar events.
For example:
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Infinite+Loop+1,+Cupertino,+CA,+United+States&sll=37.331693,-122.030764&sspn=0.007311,0.009871&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1+Infinite+Loop,+Cupertino,+Santa+Clara,+California+95014&ll=37.331906,-122.031262&spn=0.007311,0.009871&z=17
If you open this link on an iPad it should take you to the Maps application.
But you would have to do this manually on a computer for each event.

A: There are several apps that have this featured into them. Many of them are free. I think downloading a free app with this feature would be the simplest most straight forward way to do this.
