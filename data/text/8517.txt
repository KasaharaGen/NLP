Q: How to find the location of the items I created in iTunes? I created music as .wav files using a program called Mackie Traction. I then used iTunes to convert them to .mp3 files. 
How can I attach these files to an email to export them to MySpace or other similar sites?

A: *

*Select track in iTunes

*Right-click -> Show/Reveal in Finder

*Drag files from Finder window into new mail message


Alternatively (if dragging directly in step 3 doesn't work) you can click the Attachment icon in the new mail message, navigate to the folder opened in step 2 (or just drag the MP3 from the folder window into the Open dialog) and attach the file directly. 

A: Hold down the control key and click on one of the songs you converted in iTunes. On the context menu that appears, one of the options is Show in Finder. Select that option.
A Finder window will open that reveals your file. You can then attach it to an e-mail or upload it to a website just like any other file.
If you have Apple Mail configured to work with your email account, the procedure is simple: drag the file to the Apple Mail icon on the Dock, and drop it. This will create a new mail message with your file as an attachment.
