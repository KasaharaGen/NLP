Q: How can I delete an apple account? I have an old account that I don't use. I can log in through 
https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/
and edit my account but can't find anywhere to delete it.
Is it possible?

A: Any apple account that is created cannot be deleted.  Just create a new account if you need a new one.

A: I don't see why you couldn't, although I can't find any option to on Apple ID website. You could try this page:
http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/
And/or contact iTunes support, they're the ones who deal with this usually.
Good luck!
