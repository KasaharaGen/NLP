Q: Function keystrokes 'ate' by host when running Win7 in a VirtualBox I'm a recent Mac convert, but still need to use Windows for work related tasks. A man's gotta eat & pay for internet access.
I have VirtualBox setup w/ a Windows 7 VM. The VM has Visual Studio 2008 installed, along w/ various needed utilities. Everything works great or as expected except for the fact that pressing most of the F keys (F1-F12, excluding F5 & F6) are intercepted by the host OS and processed. I know you can press Command+Fn+F to accomplish this; however, a lot of quick access commands are assigned to the F-keys. (Especially F9-F11 for debugging). These are accessed quite often and the 3 finger combo gets old, fast.
Question:  Is there anyway w/ VirtualBox to, perhaps only in full screen mode, to have the host OS pass those through or otherwise not process them w/o the need for Command+Fn?
I've tried googling but haven't had much success.
TIA

A: With 10.6 and a USB keyboard, the Fn keys pass through to the app; OS-X only intercepts the media functions.
In your OS-X's Keyboard SysPrefs pane, is: 

Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard
  function keys

selected?
With this selection, my (unshifted) F-keys pass straight through to my VBox VM.  With it unselected, I need to use the Fn key to generate type them (even within OS-X).

A: also note that in Keyboard ==> Keyboard shortcuts ==> "Mission Control" settings disable F11 and F12 for show desktop and show gadgets, excuse me, show dashboard.  

A: Not that I'm aware of, no. However, if you have a full size keyboard, there's a second Fn key to the right of the Delete key which can be used in place of the Command+Fn combination.
