Q: Disabling Preview's "sliding" animation The pages of my pdf presentation add incremental changes to the first page. The second page, for instance, consists of the diagram on the first page in addition to a few more lines. This way a complex figure can be introduced gradually.
But Preview now "slides" each page, which defeats the effect I am after (a few changes just appear). Instead the audience is treated to a distracting effect.
Is there a way to disable the fancy sliding and go back to replacing pages?

A: You can use ⌥ + ↓/↑ or ⌥ + ←/→ to navigate pages without the sliding effect.

A: As a workaround - use Skim. It has better tools for full-screen presentations anyway.

Note - native Lion full-screen doesn't work yet, but the non-native fullscreen works fine.

A: Um...If you go to "View" then click "Continuous Scroll", everything should go back to normal.
