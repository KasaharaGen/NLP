Q: Where is nmblookup in Lion? I'm trying to call nmblookup in a Terminal on Lion, but it's not available. How can I lookup NMB hostnames from the Terminal now?

A: Samba is no more part of OS X: Lion has an own implementation of the protocol. It was dropped because Samba moved to a stricter license (GPLv3) which gives Apple problems with the publication of the software on the App Store.
Edit
Here you can find some more information: http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/23/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_apple_replaces_samba_for_windows_networking_services.html
nmblookup was removed along many other command line tools:

[...]reducing the number of commands and subcommands from over a
  hundred to just 19[...]

Thanks to cksum for the hint
As Ingmar answers you can use smbutil lookup

A: On OS X 10.7 (Lion):
smbutil lookup <hostname>

Example:
$ smbutil lookup NAS1
Got response from 10.21.0.133
IP address of NAS1: 10.21.0.133


A: run the following command: 
which nmblookup

It should output the following: 
-bash-3.2$ which nmblookup
/usr/bin/nmblookup

This is on 10.6.8

A: The nmblookup utility should be in /usr/bin.  Check your $PATH to see if it has been included by typing echo $PATH at the system prompt.  If it does exist in your path, then you can run the command which nmblookup, as suggested by @Lyken.  Otherwise, to find a command that is not located in your path, type the following commands at the system prompt.
cd /
find . -name "<name>" -print

There is also the whereis command, however, this only checks the standard binary directories for the specified program.
The alternative to nmblookup is nslookup.  This is also located under /usr/bin.
Note that I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8.

A: If you must have nmblookup you may install samba3 via MacPorts and probably brew, I don't use brew so I'm not completely sure.
