Q: How can I write a tab character in Safari? I tried using the tab key with the modifier keys, but I didn't get Safari to write a tab character in a text field shown in an HTML page.
Is it possible to do it? If it is possible, how can I do it?

A: Enable the "Unicode Hex Input" input method from System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources and then type Option 0009.

A: Press Cmd-Alt-T to bring up "Special Characters..." in the Edit menu.
Search for "tab" and click Insert. You're looking for the one named "Character tabulation"
The website may not display it correctly,
but it will indent code.


A: I usually wind up typing a tab in TextEdit or Stickies and copy-and-pasting it in Safari.

A: The Wikipedia article titled Control key reports the following text:

Under Mac OS X, the Control key allows the use of Emacs-style key combinations in most text entry fields. For example, Ctrl-A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph, Ctrl-L vertically centers the current line in the editing field, Ctrl-K cuts text to the end of the line to a kill ring separate from the normal clipboard, etc.

The table before that note reports that Ctrl-Q works as "Literal insert." I tried entering Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-I in Safari 5.0.4, and I get a tab in the text entry. 
It doesn't work on SE sites, as those combinations are used, respectively, to start a quoted text and emphasized text.
It doesn't seem to work on Safari 5.1, or Firefox 4.

A: You can use control-option-tab.
In other applications you can use option-tab, but in Safari tab and option-tab are used to select elements in web views.
