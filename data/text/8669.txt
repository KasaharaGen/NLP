Q: Changing OS X Spotlight priorities for specific applications I'd like to fiddle with Spotlight's priorities so that when I enter 'photo', my first returned result is Adobe Photoshop, and not Photo Booth.
I understand how to change priorities for or disable entire file types, but I'd rather just remove Photo Booth from Spotlight search.
Failing that, I could just delete Photo Booth. I don't use it. I think Photo Booth can't normally be deleted on Lion, so what's the command to delete it via Terminal?

A: You don't need to delete anything. And I strongly advise you not too, since it's a built-in app. It could be useful to other part of the system, and it will probably be added back on a system update.

About your problem, Spotlight is smart, it will learn that when you type "photo" you want to open iPhoto over the time.
Just keep on typing photo, and selecting iPhoto over PhotoBooth.

If Spotlight is not smart enough or fast enough for you, you can try an alternative launcher, such as Alfred. It may be faster to learn than Spotlight (at least, it's what I found happened for me).

A: Have been running into this myself, and I decided to tweak a little. Here's what I ended up with...
Open the photoshop directory through applications.
'Get info' on the Photoshop executable. 'Cmd + i' or right click and choose)
Top field is 'spotlight comments', type a text shortcut that suits you, I used 'phos'
Close the info window.
Open up spotlight and use the shortcut you chose.

A: Adding iPhoto and Photo Booth to your spotlight privacy settings will remove it from the Spotlight results
