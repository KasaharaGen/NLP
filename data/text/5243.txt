Q: Numbers: hotkeys to choose cells in formula edit mode When I edit formulae in Numbers, is it possible to select nearby cells using the cursor keys?
For example, I might be editing cell C3, and set its formula to "=B2+C2". I would like to select cells B2 by hitting the ⬆︎ and then the ⬅︎, to take the cursor from C3 to B2. I've tried hitting the keys, and using combinations of ⇧ Shift, ⌥ Option, and ⌘ Command. 
Is there a way to do this?

A: Yes. While editing the formula you can use the ⌃ Control ⌥ Option keys with the arrow key's to move around and you can select multiple cells using ⇧ Shift as per normal.
