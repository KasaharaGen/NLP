Q: Trouble creating new Exchange Server account in Lion I'm helping a colleague set up his new MBA. When we try to create his email account in mail.app, we choose Exchange but the auto-discover feature fails to start.
It has worked fine for 4 others in the office so we know our Exchange 2007 server is programmed to support auto-discovery. 
When we try to manually enter the server settings, he can receive email but not send.
I know that auto-discover prompts for userid, password and domain. When we enter the data manually, we can't find a place to enter the domain. Is this why he can't send email?
What else can we try?  Is this an Apple issue since auto-discovery doesn't start?
