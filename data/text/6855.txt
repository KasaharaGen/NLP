Q: How do I prevent Lion Mail from marking a message as read after deleting/archiving another message? This is driving me nuts. I go through my mail in reverse chronological order. This means I look at the newest mails first and then go back from there. So this scenario happens dozens of times a day:


*

*Check out message, decide to mark it as unread to review/act on later

*Proceed to next, older, message

*When I decide to delete/archive the current message, Mail will highlight the message from 1. and mark it as read (because it is selected)

*This forces me to REmark this last message as unread before proceeding


Any ideas on how to solve this?

A: Press ‚å•+backspace to delete the message. No other message will be highlighted.
Warning: This deletes the selected message(s) permanently.

A: There's a plugin for Apple Mail called TruePreview (freeware, http://christianserving.org/project/truepreview) which let you define when a message should be marked as read. 
E.g I have set it to seven seconds so when I go through my messages (I do it the same way as you) they still are marked as unread. I have to stay on a message for seven seconds to be marked as read.
You can configure that behavior on a per account basis.
The plugin for Lion Mail is an alpha relase (please read the release notes)

A: What works for me is to collapse the message preview section of the window, which requires clicking on a message index to open the message in a new window.  In SnowLeopard, drag the divider below the message index to the bottom of the window; in Lion, drag the divider on the right side of the message index to the right of the window.
When using Mail like this, it won't mark a message as read until you open the message in a separate window.  So, when the selection moves around the message index, it won't automatically preview the message and mark it as read.
