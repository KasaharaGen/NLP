Q: how many devices can be registered for iOS Enterprise programme I am working in a big organization where I want to distribute application with 300 different devices. 
I came to know that iOS Enterprise programme is available for such a big in house distribution , 
But I want to know how many device can be registered with such programe ? 
With simple developer programe with ad-hock profile we are able to register  100 different devices that I know but with enterprise I do not have any idea.
If any one know then please let me know.
thanks in advance...

A: I'm pretty sure it's unlimited, tho I couldn't confirm it from any official source. There are reports of people using it for way over 300 devices, tho, so you should be fine.

A: Actually, it's also 100 for the developer provisioning profile. But if the application is distributed using the distribution provisioning profile and not developer provisioning profile, it's unlimited.
