Q: Restoring a Snow Leopard time capsule using Leopard DVD boot? possible? So I have a time capsule of a few machines.
The one i did last (Snow Leopard) doesn't seem to be showing in the list.
I don't have a snow leopard DVD boot handy only Leopard.
Is this why this isn't in the list?

A: Yes - I'm afraid this is the case. You will need to find a Snow Leopard DVD or Lion recovery HD/USB to restore your files.
Since this DVD used to come with all Macs, you should be able to find a friend who has one. Otherwise, try the Apple store or AppleCare to order a replacement Snow Leopard DVD.
