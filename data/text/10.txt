Q: Faster alternative to ShakesPeer? I've used ShakesPeer for it's clean and Mac-like interface. But the downloads are really slow. Is there a faster alternative to ShakesPeer?
Preferably having at least the same features as ShakesPeer itself if not more. Also preferable if the software follows the Apple Human Interface Guidelines.

A: I haven't tried these but Jucy and EiskaltDC++ are two DirectConnect clients that work on mac.  However, neither appears to use a mac interface.

A: Whatever calavera pointed you at â€” also, try MLDonkey, NeoModus Direct Connect (DC original client!) and Valknut, they all have Mac versions.
Since I'm not a DC user, can't comment on speed =(
