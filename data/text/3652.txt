Q: Can i track my friend's iphone with the help of any app on iphone? Can i track my friend's iphone with the help of any app on iphone? Is it really possible? He always tells a lie about location.
I tried many apps on App Store but they all are fake. 

A: Try installing Google Latitude on the phone?

A: What about the free Find my Friends app? It's free, made by Apple (so definitly not fake) and works on iOS 5 (which your iPhone 4 supports)

A: You can use this application.
It uses an hidden file stored on the iPhone recording an history of location. It has been a little buzz since yesterday when it came out on almost all media worldwide.
From the description of how to tool is working, it will even work with a backup file of the device. So you can use it on a Mac where the iPhone has been sync'ed and backed-up.
PS:
I don't want to go in the discusion "is it a good thing to track people etc...". Just trying to answer the OP question...
