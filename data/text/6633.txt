Q: Where can I buy a spare power cable for a i5 Mac Mini? I don't see extra power cables for the i5 2011 Mac Mini in the Apple Store Accessory section.
But this power cable looks a lot like black ones I've seen that go between a power brick for a Lenovo laptop and the outlet. Is this the very same cable?

A: Provided it connects fine you should be ok. It uses a standard power plug with this design. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4806 
Otherwise any sort of Apple Service Provider or http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/23-190

A: The Mac Mini uses the standard IEC 60320 C-7 female connector, take a look here for useful reference -

C-7â€™s are common and available everywhere (e.g. Amazon, Target, Best Buy, etc.)
