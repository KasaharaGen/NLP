Q: How can I get rid of Newsstand? After the upgrade to iOS-5, I got the Newsstand app "for free". I don't use it and I probably never will. Is there any way, short of jail breaking, for me to remove it from my iPad2?
I know that I can put it in a folder, but can I remove it entirely?

A: No. Like all iOS applications coming pre-installed, Newsstand cannot be removed from an iOS device. See the Apple Support Forums for corroboration.
