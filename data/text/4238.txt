Q: USB Stereo Microphone for iPad? What are working stereo USB microphone options for the iPad? It needs to be usable as an audio input into recorder apps? Presumably plugged into the iPad through the USB camera connection adapter.

A: Blue Microphones' Yeti and Yeti Pro stereo USB microphones can be used in any recording app on the iPad via the Camera Connection Kit.
The manufacturer confirms that this is possible, and has detailed directions for setting it up (including a video) on this page.
Note that you will need a powered USB hub.

A: The Tascam iM2 is a stereo condenser microphone that attaches directly to the dock connector of your iPad. Tascam's PCM Recorder app interfaces with this device to record in stereo.

A: I think what you desire most is to purchase one good USB microphone which can be used with multiple computing devices besides just the iPad.
Here is another strategy: Get an iPad-to-audio interface that you can use to connect to conventional microphones.
The Alesis iO Dock is one possibility on the high-end.
The Tascam iXZ Audio Interface is another.
IK Multimedia, Apogee and Line 6 also make similar products but they are designed for guitar input, not microphone input. Trying to get one of these to work with a microphone would be tricky due to differing impedance levels and preamplifier requirements.
In other news, Apogee has a forthcoming (probably quite expensive) studio-quality monaural microphone that can be plugged directly into an iPad. This should be great for podcast recording.
