Q: Is Apple throttling web apps on iPhone? According to the Register Apple is throttling web apps:

If a web app is run from the iOS 4.3 home screen – in other words, if
  it is saved to the screen alongside local apps downloaded from the
  Apple App Store – and launched into full-screen mode, it runs roughly
  two to two and a half times slower than it does in the browser,
  according to various tests. It appears that whereas Apple has updated
  the iOS 4.3 Safari browser with its high-speed Nitro JavaScript
  engine, Nitro is not used when web apps are launched from the home
  screen.

Is this true?

A: It's more that Safari was being boosted in 4.3 and that that boost was not available to Web Apps on the homescreen
According to ArsTechnica this is fixed in iOS 5.
