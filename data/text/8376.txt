Q: iPad wake up to an app Is there a way I can set my iPad to always open a particular ap when I wake it up (open my smart cover)?
I'm specifically interested in doing this with a text editor.

A: Evernote Peek can do this. It's an app which allows you to close your smartcover (don't know if you have one) and when reopening it, the app is still open.
So, yes it's possible.
