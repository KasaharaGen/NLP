Q: Downgrading from "Java for OS X Lion Update 1" I recently ran Software Update and installed "Update 1" for Java for Lion. Unfortunately this broke about the only thing I use Java for - a webcam applet to check conditions at a ski area. The applet hangs Safari until I close the tab and force quit the process, and in Chrome it simply displays the Java Applet loading screen with no progress.
So, the questions:


*

*How can I remove this update?

*Where can I get the original version? The only download link I can find now leads to the updated version.


A: I don't know where to find original version of Java for Mac OS Lion.
At least you can download Java Developer Package for Mac OS X 10.7 with your AppleID or try Java Developer Package for Mac OS X 10.7 Update 1 package to be sure if this bug is here.
Tutorials how to downgrade your Java you can find here and here.
