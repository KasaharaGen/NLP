Q: De-Authorise iTunes account on my 3 stolen PC's I have had 3 PC's stolen during a break in. How can I de-authorise my account on these without access to them ?  

A: Follow these instructions from Apples Knowledge Base:

  
*
  
*Click iTunes Store on the left side of iTunes.
  
*If you're not signed in to the store, click the Account button, then
  enter your account name and password.
  
*Click the Account button again (your Apple ID appears on the
  button), enter your password, and then click View Account.
