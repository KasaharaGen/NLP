Q: Is the iOS 5 beta no longer usable? I've been using iOS5 beta 7 for a while.  About 4 hours ago (possibly the end of the 20th, PST, the expiration date for iOS 5 beta 7) the phone locked itself and claims it requires activation.  Whenever I try, it claims the activation server is temporarily unavailable.
Should I sit tight and wait, or is there something else I can do, such as wipe iOS5 and reinstall from a release image?

A: You'll have to upgrade to the release version, not much else you can do about it.

A: if your iPhone refuses to being updated to iOS 5.0, maybe you should put it in DFU (Device Firmware Update mode). To do that, follow these instructions:


*

*Plug your iPhone to your Mac/PC;   

*Hold the power button for 2 seconds;

*Without releasing the power button, hold the home button for 10 seconds

*Release the power button and keep holding the home button until your iPhone appears in iTunes;

*Proceed with software restore; you might restore your software backup at the end of the procedure.


A: The only beta still usable is the GM. So try updating to this beta.
