Q: Turn Wifi Off via command line I'm sharing my internet in work and forgot to turn it off! Does anyone know how I can do it via the command line? I have SSH access but thats it. D'oh. 

A: Try 
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off


A: You could use this to turn it off:
sudo ifconfig en1 down

And if you want to get it back up, just type up, instead of down
Just make sure that en1 is the right interface or you can easily kill off your ssh access :)
P.S. As Lri noted in the comments below, you can quickly disable the correct network interface with just 1 line:
sudo ifconfig `networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep -E '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)' -A 1 | grep -o "en."` down

This will detect the correct Airport/wireless device and will turn it off
