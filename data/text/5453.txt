Q: Can I gift a song from the iPhone iTunes app? Just as the title says: can I gift a song from within the iTunes iPhone app? I searched but couldn't find any option to.

A: Gifting only works from iTunes on a computer. 
Perhaps it could be added if enough people ask to spend money that way.

You can also gift from store apps with iOS 6.
