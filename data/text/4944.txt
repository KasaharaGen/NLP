Q: Why has my iPhone camera stopped focusing? My camera doesn't focus any more. Is that a known issue and is there a fix for this? If not, can I take it to be fixed? I had this phone for less than a year. 

A: Since the phone is less than a year old, it will be covered by the default AppleCare warranty. I suggest contacting Apple, and they will probably just replace the phone outright.

A: Took it in Apple store. They fixed it. The motor that does the focusing was not working.  They fixed it for free.  Person who did the job told me that I don't need a warranty if this happens in the future they'll fix it for free because it takes very little time and no parts need to be replaced.
