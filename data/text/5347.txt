Q: Is Mission Control an addition to Exposé & Spaces UI or a replacement? Lion has Mission Control that combines features from both Exposé and Spaces. Do the old Exposé and Spaces UIs still exist in Lion or does Mission Control replace them?
I've heard mixed rumors about whether Spaces/Exposé exists or not; and all the YouTube et al. videos/reports concentrate on featuring the Mission Control but won't tell straight if it is an addition or a replacement.
I understand, though, there are spaces—called desktops—on the top of the Mission Control UI.
There definitely are spaces, but is there Spaces?

A: Mission Control replaces them.
All the things that you used to be able to do in expose and spaces should be in Mission Control as well (Well... Not really, you can't have spaces arranged in two dimensional space anymore).
But no, there's no more Spaces or Expose anymore. Yes it's called desktop now.
