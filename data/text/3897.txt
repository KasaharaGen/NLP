Q: AppStore stopped working Today I wanted to download a free application from the AppStore.
First it wanted me to review my account settings, I accepted the license, then filled out the empty fields and it asked for my payment settings. Since I don't have US payment method, I had to switch to the Hungarian store, because no payment was not an option there.
They charged me (for around $4) and switched me to the Hungarian store. Later I could set it back to the US store with iTunes where I could check the no payment option.
So I have an US account again.
But since then I could not download any application. It starts to download it, finishes the progress bar and then this alert window appears:

Of course there is no problem with my Internet connection.
The application is installed nevertheless but the AppStore application could not see it as an installed app so I could not check the updates for it.
Update: In the /var/log/install.log it seems the installation has been finished:

Update2:
Moving away ~/Library/Application Support/AppStore/ did not help the problem, update still not working:


A: The Reset cache solved my problem in the iTunes advanced preferences:

Since then I can install and upgrade applications from AppStore.
