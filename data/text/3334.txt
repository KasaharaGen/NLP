Q: Is there any alternative to MacPorts? MacPorts became really a pain because it does compile the packages on your machine, like the infamous gentoo and I would like something with a smaller footprint on your machine.
I know that Fink and other solutions exists but from what I remember form few years ago they are less maintained than macports.
I would like to read a more informed opinion regarding which solution would be optimal and why. 

A: Alternatives for MacPorts
Homebrew

*

*Uses OS X binary versions when available

*Compiles OS X optimized versions

*

*Compiling usually faster than with MacPorts



*Easy to use, e.g. to install wget: $ brew install wget

*Tries to separate already installed software from what is installed through brew …

*… while taking advantage of already installed software and libraries (e.g. doesn't install a working version of Perl twice)

*Installing software doesn't need root access

*Actively developed on github
Fink

*

*Uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get

*Easy to use, e.g. to install wget: $ fink install wget

*Can be used to install precompiled packages or to compile everything from the source

*Has a separate directory tree to avoid interference with the system

Rudix

*

*Last version 2010-04-10

MacLibre

*Has GUI

*Nothing new on the website since 2008
