Q: iOS 4.2 - What's there for the iPhone 3GS? I have looked at iOS 4.2 wrap-ups and all I can see are features for iPad.
Besides AirPrint (which does not work with my printer), is there anything for the iPhone 3GS there?

A: Among other things:


*

*Free “Find my iPhone” (don’t need MobileMe) —> this requires an iPhone 4

*Safari allows you to search inside the page

*You can assign different SMS/MMS/ALERTS to different phonebook contacts

*AirPlay / AirPrint?

*A volume slider control in the Multitaskbar

*New icon for Voice Memos
 - 


Anything else?  
UPDATE: There’s a trick to use the Find my iPhone in a 3GS or similar. I found out that if you create everything from an iPhone 4 (and/or presumably an iPod TOuch latest gen), you can later go to your 3Gs and enter the same data and it will work. :)

A: new Calendar application with among other things, new birthday icon
