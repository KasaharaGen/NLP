Q: Keyboard shortcut to select all text in a cell in Excel Is there a keyboard shortcut key to select all the text in the current cell in Excel, if you are in the process of editing the cell? 

A: The quickest way I've found is the following:
1) tab/select the cell, 
2) hit backspace to delete the contents of the cell
3) type Cntrl+Z to undo delete
When the undo function puts the text back into the cell, all text within that cell is automatically highlighted.  Then you can just type Cntrl+C to copy text only.  
I found that I needed to highlight all text in a cell in order to be able to paste it back inside another excel sheet whose cells already had other text that I had to leave intact.  
Hope this helps! 

A: *

*^-U to edit the cell

*⇧-alt-Home to select all text

*⇧-alt-Left to select one word to the left

*⇧-alt-Right to select one word to the right

*⇧-alt-Down to select from the current location to the end of the line.


Note that in later versions of Excel, the “Windows” equivalents, made by substituting the alt for control, also work.

A: The great thing about copying the contents of the cell rather than the cell itself is to grab the contents without any formatting (plain text). It really should have a one-step shortcut, but to my knowledge, it doesn't. Here's my workaround:
Select cell in question, hit any character to replace contents of the cell. Then hit ⌘Z to undo and boom, contents selected without any formatting!
A one-step shortcut workaround will require more effort, but can be achieved with the following Keyboard Maestro macro:


A: I read this as 2 questions.
Q. Is there a keyboard shortcut key to select all the text in the current cell in Excel?
A. command+c for Mac or control+c for Windows while the cell is selected. Choose a new cell and command+v or control+v to paste.

Q. If you are in the process of editing the cell?
A. It is a two step process, command+a or control+a to select all, then command+c or control+c to copy.

A: When editing a cell, a quick way to select all the contents is to…


*

*place the cursor at the beginning of contents and hit ⇧ shift + end

*place the cursor at end of contents and hit ⇧ shift + home.


A: Do you want to select all the text, or do you really just want to copy it to the clipboard?  If you want to copy all the text in a cell and don't care if it's selected:
Click on a cell or navigate to it using the keyboard. Do not double-click or not enter edit mode. Do not try to select anything. If you are already in edit mode for some reason, hit Esc.
Now just hit CMD-C.

A: I'm using Windows, and I do this:


*

*Press F2 to edit the cell. The cursor will be at the end. (Also works by double clicking on the cell with the mouse; press End if the cursor is not at the end.)

*Press Ctrl + Shift + Home. All text from the end to the beginning will be selected.
Note it doesn't work if you enter the cell by writing on it, you have to edit.

A: There is no direct way.  Please refer the official page for this.

Use of native methods (go to end, use SHIFT+Arrow keys)... wondering why ^A is not supported there.  MS S**ks sometimes.
