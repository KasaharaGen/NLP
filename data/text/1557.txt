Q: HDTV only detected when turned off (connected via DisplayPort to HDMI) I tried to connect my LG HDTV (42" LD650) to my MacBook Pro 13" (mid-2010) using a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. When I plug the cable in, my MacBook's screen flickers every time but the TV is only detected when it is in standby mode. Its status will switch to "No Display Connected" the moment I turn it on.
Here is what System Profiler shows when the TV is in standby mode:

NVIDIA GeForce 320M:

I tried the TV and HDMI cable using a Windows PC and it worked instantly.
Is my TV somehow incompatible with the MacBook Pro, or is my adapter faulty, or am I doing something wrong?

A: While the TV is on standby, try going into System Preferences > Displays Preferences and set your displays to mirror. 

A: I just bought a new adapter (same type/manufacture) and updated to EFI 2.0 - the problem is fixed, now. 

A: Are you using a graphics card switching app like gfxCardStatus?  I had a similar problem when I first started connecting to my tv because I was set to use Intel graphics only.  The Intel graphics chipset doesn't support HDMI output. 
I see in your system profiler output the NVidia card, but I'm wondering if you're still somehow switched to the Intel...
