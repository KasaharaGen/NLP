Q: How do I switch between application windows with keyboard shortcuts? Say I have two windows of a browser running, how can  I switch between those two windows? like Command + Tab?

A: ⌘ Command + `
will cycle between windows of the current application when using i.a. US keyboard.

A: *

*⌘`: Move focus to next window (in application)

*⌃F4: Move focus to active or next window (visible windows on the current space)


(On the U.S. locale and keyboard layout.)


A: To have a more complete way of switching between windows in all apps simiilar to the Windows way get a third party application like Witch or Optimal Layout both are now in the App Store.
Both of these allow ⌘ Command + Tab will switch between all windows in all apps in a last used order (or can be configured to another order)
