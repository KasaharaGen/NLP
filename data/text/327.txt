Q: Prevent "Sleep / Stand by" in iBooks Does anyone know how to prevent the iPad from going to sleep / stand by when in the iBooks app?
I'm using the iPad as a music stand with my charts, but while I'm playing the song, the screen goes black... this (as I'm sure you can imagine) totally blows.

A: I'm not sure how to prevent sleep only in the iBooks app, but if you find yourself in a situation where you don't want your iPad to go to sleep, go into Settings -> General -> Auto-Lock and select "Never". With this option selected, the iPad won't go to sleep without user input.
