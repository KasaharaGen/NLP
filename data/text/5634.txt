Q: Copy iTunes playlists to external USB flash drive I have lots of playlists on my iTunes library, and I want to be able to copy the music of certain playlists to a flash drive to play on a stereo system. I have too many songs in too many folders to just copy the raw .mp3 files, so that option is out. Any other ideas?

A: Unless I miss something, you can just drag & drop the playlist to your USB drive. 

A: iTunesExport is a Java program that you can use to export iTunes playlists including the music files to a specific directory or drive.
If you regularly want to export iTunes playlists the iTunesExport command line version makes it easy to create bash scripts you can reuse.
