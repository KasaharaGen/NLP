Q: Notepad2 alternative for Mac 
Possible Duplicate:
Can anyone recommend a programmers editor? 

I have recently started using a Mac. I am used to Notepad2 for handy text editing. I am used to its keyboard shortcuts and options and would like to have something similar on Mac.
I need something with shortcuts for:


*

*line deletion

*line duplication

*sorting lines alphabetical

*converting characters to unicode codes

*word wrapping


I also need at least:


*

*code highlighting

*tag autocompletion

*regex


What do you recommend?

A: TextMate and BBEdit are the most popular text editors of note on the Mac. You will find an equal number of people passionate about both pieces of software, so you will have to decide for yourself.
Both are extensible in a big way and have many different plug-ins or bundles available for download on the web.

A: Try MacVim. ViM is keybased by nature, so all functions have their shortcuts. If you haven't find some function binded, you can bind it yourself.
Also you can try Automator, Typinator and many other programs which works with any program you have
