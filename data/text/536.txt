Q: Network problems after Jailbreakme on iPhone I recently jailbroke my iPhone 3gs with jailbreakme. 
At the beginning everything was working well. But since yesterday I am having problems with the network. It would disconnect from wifi and there is no way that I can reconnect until I reboot my phone. It happened twice so far, but I am not able to reproduce the problem as it doesn't happen all the time. 
Anyone here has any hint on what I should check? 

Edit: I found out that this problem occurs if it changes wifi network. 
Edit: Resetting the network settings was the right solution for me. 
Does anyone know if this is a common problem? ( I was not able to find anything with google )

A: That happened to me too, and now my wifi doesn't work anymore so you should expect that. (not much an answer just a comment)
3 possible fixes you can try: (they did not work for me)
1) Reset network settings: Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings.
3) When connected to your network click more info (the little > icon) and check if DHCP is enabled.
2) The last thing Restore your device from Itunes or reset the device from Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings.

A: Have you tried resetting your network settings? 
Here's how to do it:
Settings >> General >> Reset >> Reset Network Settings. 
That usually solves network problems. If it doesn't work for you, please post back here and I'll try to help some more.
