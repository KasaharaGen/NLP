Q: Interrupted Mac App Store Download - Xcode After losing my connection while downloading Xcode 4.2.1, the App Store has removed it from available updates and under purchases it says I am up to date (even though the date of the my installed version is before the latest update date). I have tried to do:
defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true

And then use the Debug menu item after restarting the App Store using these instructions:

Is there any other way to directly download 4.2.1 or to force the App Store to clear its cache, short of removing Xcode entirely?

A: Click on Purchases by keeping the ‚å• key pressed (option key). It will need 10 seconds to initiate the tab (more or less), but afterwards you'll be able to re-download any purchased app.
