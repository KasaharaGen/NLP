Q: MacBook Air Kensington Lock Alternative The MacBook Air has no Kensington lock slot. What other options are available for  protecting it from theft?

A: Here's one USB option. Haven't tested it personally, though, but seems better than some of the alternatives involving plastic shells and such.

A: Plugspy by Celmaro claims to secure a MacBook Air by monitoring its MagSafe connection status:

Plug Spy au­to ac­ti­vates when your screen is locked and start an an­noy­ing high vol­ume alert sound and send a Growl no­ti­fi­ca­tion when your Mac­Book gets un­plugged from the MagSafe pow­er adapter.


A: I like a good old hardware solution, just a basic lock/ case. I ordered the below macbook air lock. It worked! the bottom part has a built in security lock and you get a cable with it.

A: This security solution from Multplx works with all laptops, there is no need for a Kensington lock slot as their solution secures via the audio port. You can buy just the Anchor adaptor on its own or adaptor and cable lock. I use it for my macbook and its got really good reviews from users of many other laptops too.
