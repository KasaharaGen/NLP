Q: Why is my mid-2010 MacBook Pro experiencing a blank blue screen and crashing? I've had this happen a couple of times so far, not sure what's happening. I think it's related to having an external monitor connected to the notebook.
My regular workflow is to have the MBP log out in the morning so TimeMachine will back up my FileVaulted home directory. I disconnect everything (USB hub, external monitor, power) and tell the MBP to sleep, then close the lid.
I use the system during the day and when I get home reconnect the USB and external display.
Twice in a few weeks I have had the display on the external LCD go white and the built-in display go completely blue, no kernel panic, no displayed errors, nothing. I am forced to power it off by holding the power button and then boot it back up.
Last night it did it to me. It had my email/web browser open and I sat down, touched the mouse, and the displays just jumped to solid white and the built-in to solid blue.
The last time I remember this happening I had Spaces enabled, and thinking there was an issue with the external monitor connected with Spaces enabled (I think the crash happened after the MBP went to sleep overnight, connected to power, and I woke it in the morning to have it go kerplooey) I disabled Spaces and it seemed to be more stable, as I didn't remember it happening for quite awhile.
I opened the window server logs for the time of the crash and only found this (reboot was near 7:15 PM):

A: Although you don’t mention the right MBP model you have (year/model/etc.) I’ve had similar issues that were caused by the graphic card being faulty. This started to happen “one day” and then it happened more and more often, but in random places, which made it hard for me to find out what it was. I ended up in an Apple Store and they had to replace the board (which was still under warranty).
I’d say you take it to an Apple Store for inspection.
