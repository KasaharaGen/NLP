Q: How can I remove a site from the reading list in Safari on my iPhone? How do I edit the items in my "reading list" in Safari?  Unlike bookmarks, there doesn't seem to be an "edit" option.

A: To remove an item, just swipe your finger to left over that particular entry. A red "delete" button will pop up.
