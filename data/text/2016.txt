Q: What app can I use to create mockups for websites?  I'm looking for a free or commercial software for Os X to create mockups for websites. Any suggestion?

A: Balsamiq Mockups is a good one, fairly cheap and very good - http://balsamiq.com/

A: You can do all sorts of fun things with Omnigraffle as well. And if you're looking for a way to make easy wireframes of current websites, you might do worse than checking out Wirify. Good luck!

A: WireframeSketcher is a cross-platform rapid wireframing tool.

A: For mocking up websites I swear by Adobe Fireworks, it might be overkill, but the abilty to have a library of buttons etc and set a master page that carries elements to all the other pages, so headers/footers etc only need to be changed once.

A: Check out frame boxâ€”a "lightweight online tool for creating mockups."

A: Depending on the definition of "mockup", you might be interested in DENIM.

DENIM is a system that helps web site
  designers in the early stages of
  design. DENIM supports sketching
  input, allows design at different
  refinement levels, and unifies the
  levels through zooming.


A: Just In Mind is probably one of the most extensive commercial website mockup apps, and Mockingbird is a fairly lightweight online mockup tool.
If you use Firefox 3, take a look at Pencil, a free wireframe sketching add-on. A version for Firefox 4 is available here, but I haven't tried it.

A: You may try SwordSoft Layout. It also available on the App Store
