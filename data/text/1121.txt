Q: Do I just need a VGA to RCA adaptor to stream video from my macbook to TV? I want to get the adaptor to stream videos from my macbook to my TV.
I already have the Apple adaptor from DVI to VGA: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB572Z/A?fnode=MTY1NDA4Mw&mco=MTM3NTA3MDU
I know need an adaptor from VGA to RCA.. I guess this one: http://www.bzsell.com/product_pic/10/05/16/flag_129185411642265983.JPG
But the guy at the store, told me that it is not that easy. If the TV is old (and it is), I need a video converter... (around 50 euros)
is that true ?
thanks

A: You might need a converter, but I don’t think so. Bear in mind that all those conversions will degrade the image a lot. 
Does your TV have S-VGA? in that case you could use this adapter from Apple. Better than RCA anyway. 
edit updated with the right adapter. As already noted, please remember that this doesn’t carry audio.
