Q: Macbook can't resolve any domain names I have a 13" Macbook running Snow Leopard 10.6.6 which is unable to go to any URL on either my office or hotel networks.
I have no proxy or firewall enabled on the computer - and have connected to both networks in the past without issue.
If I ping google.com, it responds with 'cannot resolve google.com, unknown host' - however if I ping the IP it responds fine. I can also visit the IP in my browser and it goes to the page successfully.
I have rebooted, flushed my cache in several ways, tried to use Google's DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) all to no avail.
Any advice would be super!

A: I think it has to do with Bonjour (mDNSResponder). Check out this page.
Run the following command in a Terminal:
ps aux | grep mDNS

This should tell you whether or not /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder is running. If it is not, run the following command to launch it:
sudo /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder
