Q: Run bash command with current URL as parameter from Firefox and/or safari I'd like to be able, without much hassle, add a video to my Miro Download-queue.
From bash I can do this by entering
open -a Miro.app http://vimeo.com/24398084

Now I'd like to do this from within Firefox, preferrably a one-click approach. Is there a firefox addon I could use? Some automator mechanism I could trigger?

A: You could create an automator service like this:

The service receives no input. It gets the URL of the current page in Safari, and passes it as the argument to open -a Miro.app.
You could then assign it a keyboard shortcut, et voil√†.
