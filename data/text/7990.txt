How can I prevent SMS messages from being shown on the iPhone lock screen? 

I am aware that the text message preview can be disabled so that the actual message is not displayed. However, there is still an alert that a text has been received and from whom that can be openly seen on the lock screen. Therefore full privacy is compromised.
Can I disable this alert completely on the iPhone 4?
Thank you

A: Go to Settings. Then Notifications. Then Messages from the list. There you'll see several options. One of them being "View in Lock Screen." Set that to "off."
