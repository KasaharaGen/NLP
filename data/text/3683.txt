Q: How do I get "wget" for Snow Leopard? There's no wget command. How do I get it?

A: You will need to install Xcode with Unix Dev Support, then you can download and compile the source, or try macports, or homebrew.
$ brew install wget
$ sudo port install wget
Or you could try a graphical form which includes wget, like http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24787/cocoawget

A: To expand on Michael Granger's answer: curl (included on all Snow Leopard installs) is really quite powerful, and can do a lot of what wget does (and a number of things it doesn't).
But, as noted on the curl FAQ:

1.3 What is curl not?
Curl is not a wget clone. That is a
  common misconception. Never, during
  curl's development, have we intended
  curl to replace wget or compete on its
  market. Curl is targeted at
  single-shot file transfers. 
Curl is not a web site mirroring
  program. If you want to use curl to
  mirror something: fine, go ahead and
  write a script that wraps around curl
  to make it reality (like curlmirror.pl
  does).
...

(For reference, here's that curlmirror.pl script)

A: If you don't want to use either homebrew or macports there is a great set of instructions here, reproduced below (using a slightly more up-to-date version of wget).
These instructions require both Xcode and the command line tools to be installed.
First, use curl to download the latest wget source :
curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.14.tar.gz

Next we use tar to uncompress the files you just downloaded:
tar -xzf wget-1.14.tar.gz

Use cd to change to the directory:
cd wget-1.14

Configure with the appropriate –with-ssl flag to prevent a “GNUTLS not available” error:
./configure --with-ssl=openssl

Build the source:
make

Install wget, it ends up in /usr/local/bin/:
sudo make install

Confirm everything worked by running wget:
wget --help

Clean up by removing wget source files when finished:
cd .. && rm -rf wget*


A: Probably the easiest and painless way to get wget is to install Homebrew. In fact, the very home page says:

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS X.

and their example is:
$ brew install wget

;)

A: Alternatively, if you don't need wget specifically, Snow Leopard does come with curl which does many of the same things. 
E.g., fetching your flair via wget:
wget http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png

vs. fetching it with curl:
curl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/2726.png

Notably lacking from curl is wget's --mirror option, but it does have nifty fetching with patterns, which handles many of the same problems:
# Fetch flair images for users 2726 through 2730
curl -O http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/flair/[2726-2730].png
