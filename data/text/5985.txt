Q: Can the current (08/2011) 27" iMac support two extra screens without additional hardware? I am currently considering a new iMac, but I was wondering if this would be able to support two extra monitors.
The setup I am considering:


*

*iMac built-in 27" monitor.

*Current Dell 27" monitor @ 2650x1440 (Dual-link DVI via adapter)

*One of the Thunderbolt displays @ 2560x1440 (via one of the two thunderbolt ports)


This is really two related questions:


*

*Is the above setup viable at all?

*Will the available resolution be restricted by the video card?


A: Yes, it can. Here is an example of a 27" iMac with two 30" Dell displays.
