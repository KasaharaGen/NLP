Q: open new terminal tab in the same directory with the active tab In GNOME Terminal of Ubuntu when you open a new tab the new shell will automatically start you in the current working directory of the active tab shell.
E.g. if in the active tab shell I am on ~/myproject and I open a new tab, the new shell will start on ~/myproject too.
As you can guess, this is very convenient when you work deep in the directory hierarchy.
Can I configure the OSX terminal to have this behaviour? 
If not, is there any free (cocoa) terminal that does this?

A: You may use iTerm2 and just select in preferences to "reuse previous tab's directory"


A: In recent OS X versions (Mavericks and Yosemite, not sure about earlier versions) in the Terminal.app preferences, "General" tab, there are options for "New windows open with" and "New tabs open with":


A: Here's my solution from a SuperUser question

Get the current environment in your clipboard:
env | pbcopy

Open up a new Terminal window and export those environment variables
for env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done

And to ease the process, you could always alias it, like so
alias get_env="env | pbcopy"
alias set_env="for env in `pbpaste`; do export $env; done"

So that all you have to do is

get_env âŒ˜+N set_env


The accepted solution:
#!/bin/sh 
osascript <<END 
tell app "Terminal" to do script "cd \"`pwd`\"" 
END

Place it in one of the folders in your path, make it executable (chmod +x filename). You can then run the name of this script to open a new terminal window in the same directory.
