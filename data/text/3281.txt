Q: How can I get notified when a new jailbreak or unlock is released? I got borred about all the spam created by less or more famous iOS hackers. They simply create too much hype for nothing: tweets, rss feeds, facebook pages, all of the full of nonsense messages.
I do not want to spend my time reading fake news about new hacks and I'm looking for a way of subscribing only to real "news".
For a while I considered the Jailbreak Matrix to be a page I could monitor but it looks that it not updated in time and the page became too crowded by ads.
What information source do you recommend?

A: iClarified reports on all the iOS jailbreaking/unlocking news that's relevant (along with a lot that's not entirely relevant) really quickly: http://www.iclarified.com/
