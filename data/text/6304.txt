Q: Temporarily disable autocorrect (in Lion) Occasionally, when chatting, it is fun to deliberately misspell words, dyaknowadImean?
OS X Lion is autocorrecting my misspellings into completely random words! Does anyone know how I can temporarily, (e.g. by holding down a key as i type the deliberately misspelled word?) disable autocorrect?

A: Go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Shortcuts. Add a shortcut for All Applications. Give it the keystroke you like. The name should be: "Correct Spelling Automatically".
