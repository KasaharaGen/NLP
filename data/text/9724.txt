Q: MacBook Pro HDMI No Sound I purchased a MacBook Pro in March of 2011.  I plugged a mini-to-HDMI cable from my laptop into my Sony receiver.  I have no a picture, but no sound.
There is no external source listed in the sound options, only internal speakers.  I power cycled both my receiver and my laptop, but it didn't change anything.  I am running Lion and all of my software is up to date.
What am I doing wrong?
