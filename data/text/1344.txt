Q: How to Listen For an Application Launch Event on Mac OS X I wrote an AppleScript to mount a bundled sparse disk image. I want this script to be executed exactly when Time Machine launches.
I can check if Time Machine is running with on idle statement,
on idle
    ....
    return <interval>
end idle

but I'm pretty sure, it isn't a robust way to do that.
IMO making an event trigger for Application Launch event would be a better approach.
I appreciate if someone can help me.

A: You can use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) to perform an action when a file is modified. Time Machine has some file somewhere that it modifies each time it starts.
