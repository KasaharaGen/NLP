Q: iOS: Newly added contacts get hidden and don't sync to iCloud I was facing the issue outlined on this Apple discussion thread, where I had duplicates of every contact on my iPhone -- one in iCloud, and one "Unknown". The thread presents a working solution on how to remove all "Unknown" contacts. 
However, when I add a new contact without using the + button, it still goes into an "Unknown" list. Does anyone else experience this? To replicate this, try:


*

*Add a new contact, say an unknown number from your recent calls list, or from an email. 1. Save it, and go to the home screen.

*Go to your Contacts tab in Phone

*Go back to "Groups"

*Choose "All Contacts"
Try searching for this new contact — I don't see it

*Go to your spotlight screen (home, then swipe left)

*Search for this new contact — it'll show up, and you can select it


Does anyone else see this and/or know how to solve it?

A: My guess is "unknown" is somehow the same as "On my Mac."
If you go to Address Book / preferences / accounts, do you see "on my mac" or "unknown?"
If so, if you can disable or delete it (if you're sure your contacts are all on iCloud).
That will get rid of the duplication and if/when you add a new contact on your Mac it should go up on iCloud.

A: Go to Settings>Mail, Contacts & Calendars, scroll down and there should be a default account option near the bottom in the Contacts section.
