Q: Google sync with iPhone causing incorrect dates on phone If I add a event in Google Calendar the time comes out wrong on the iPhone.
When I add an event on the iPhone the time on Google Calendar comes out wrong but the date is right?
Anyone got any ideas?

A: You can set the timezone in both the iPhone and Google Calendar.
In Google Calendar, it's in the first page of the settings.
In the iPhone, it's in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Time Zone Support (at the bottom).
You should set both in the same timezone, then see if it fixes the issue.
