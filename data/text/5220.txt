Q: how to page down when running top? When running top in terminal, I can't find a way to scroll down to view all running processes (save for resizing the window, but even then I can't display all). I tried setting and using the page down key command in the preferences, but that didn't work.
Anyone know how to scroll down in the list of processes in top?

A: Unfortunately, top is not scrollable; you're meant to sort the process list to shorten it to what you want.
htop is a more-powerful alternative that is scrollable. Here's how to install it on Mac OS X.
Or, you could use Activity Monitor from /Applications/Utilities.
