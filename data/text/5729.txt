Q: Why is Wine X11 not creating a window on my Mac? I have the wine software on my mac and I have a little problem here:
I try running my windows executable and I get this error in the console:
Application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded. make sure that your X server is running and that $DISPLAY is set correctly.

err:ole:apartment_createwindowifneeded CreateWindow failed with error 126
I have my DISPLAY set to 0.0 and WINEPREFIX set to x.
Please show me how to fix this with exact code/steps because I am new to this.
Thanks!

A: You don't have X11 installed on your computer. It is available on the OS X install CD.

A: See this SuperUser question DISPLAY on OSX is not 0.0 . It is set by the startup and you should not set the variable manually.
