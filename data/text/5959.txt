Q: How can I enable a notification that a pop-up has been blocked in Safari? QUESTION: Just wondering how to enable an alert message notifying me that a pop-up has been blocked?
I know Firefox has that feature(and other related pop-up options), but I don't use Firefox... also preferably avoid 3rd party apps.
I have Safari 5.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.

A: Better Pop Up Blocker does trigger an alert in Safari when a popup is locked.
And it also improves the effectiveness of Safari's blocking.
But - the alert behaviour does not work in Lion! Snow Leopard only. If the dev updates it for Lion it should do what you request.
