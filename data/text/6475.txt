Q: MacBook Pro 2011 logging itself out after a period of inactivity when I am not using it, at some point, every day, my MBP tries to log out on its own. When I 'wake it up' I can see message windows about "applications aborting logout", obviously because some applications that needed to save data aren't allowing OSX to close them. 
This is extremely irritating, because all applications that have nothing to save, will close down on me, sometimes in the middle of a long download. 
My MBP isn't configured for hibernation, or logging out, or even sleeping. It's always does it on AC power and I simply have no idea why.
The problem started with Snow Leopard, and persists with Lion as well.
Output of my pmset utility is:
Active Profiles:
Battery Power       -1
AC Power        -1*
Currently in use:

Does anyone have a clue why my mac tries to shut down all the applications and logout when I don't use it for a few hours? How do I stop this?

A: System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Unlock the settings -> click the Advanced button -> Disable the logout option


A: I believe I discovered the culprit. The "security" settings have a "Log out after "x" hours of inactivity". It was checked on my MBP, but disabled visually due to the settings being locked. This is probably why I wasn't paying attention to it. 
Unchecking this option, and letting run overnight, it did not try to log out. Problem resolved.

A: okay i have a much better solution for you. Go to mac appstore and download caffeine. It can keep your computer awake and more.
