Q: How can I disable the random/auto keeping of apps in the Dock? Sometimes the Dock will keep an icon app in the Dock, even though I haven't set it as such, even though I've previously de-kept it in Dock after the first time it kept it 'for me'. 
Is there a way to turn this off it's a bit annoying? 

A: go to "system preferences", then choose "Dock" and uncheck the "show recent applications in dock" radio button. 

A: Usually apps don't place themselves in the dock without your consent or knowledge. There are a couple ways to put them there though. Perhaps you may not realize it, but it may be one of these reasons:


*

*The App Store will place an app in the Dock upon installation. Note: Lion will not do this though; it simply places it in Launchpad.

*The App Store will place an app in the Dock upon updating an app. Note: Updating an non-docked app individually via the updates tab is when it gets re-placed in the dock. However using the 'Update All' button at the top of the page will not do any such thing. Again, this is changed in Lion.

*If you run an app that is not kept in the dock and drag it to another position anywhere on the dock, it will stay in the dock

*Drag an app into the dock from Finder

*Right click an app in the dock an under options select 'Keep in Dock'
