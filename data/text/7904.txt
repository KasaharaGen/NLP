Q: SSD Boot drive and encrypted HD Have an SSD installed in my MBP's optical bay. All works well other than being unable to directly log on to my main home folder, which I think is due to the fact they this folder (still on the HDD) is filevault 2 encrypted (workaround is log into a second "test account", log out and the I can successfully log into my main user account).
I really don't need to have filevault turned on, but cannot find a way to turn it off now that I boot off the SSD.  Is it possible?  Advisable?
Anticipatory thanks,
Dave    

A: If you have an external drive where everything is backed-up, the easiest thing would be to erase the HDD choosing Mac OS Extended (Journaled) then restore from the backup.

A: If you didn't remove OS X from your HDD just boot on it and go to the system preferences and disable Filevault.
You can set which driver to boot in the System Preferences.
