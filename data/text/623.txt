Q: How can I watch MegaVideo/DivX videos on my jailbroken iPhone 3G? I'm looking for a way to play megavideo (flash) and divx on my iPhone 3G which is jailbroken. Flash seems to require 3G S and above (like everything these days sigh)
Should I be able to do this, I will be able to replace my Sky box with my iPhone, as I can get live TV on there through TV catchup and access my iTunes library, I just need to be able to stream flash and divx and I'm set.
I've tried imobilecinema and that didn't play any audio or video and openstream (vlc4iphone) didn't work either.

A: Flash does not run on any version of the iPhone. You can try using a program like Air Video which will live transcode your DiVX files into a format the iPhone will play back using your computer.
As for playing it natively on your iPhone, VLC (Video Lan Client) is working on a native client but it's not available in the App Store yet.

A: You can try yxplayer on Cydia.
It's a pretty robust app which supports multiple formats.
