Q: Is there a way to export my highlighted bookmarks in iBooks? I don't see any native functionality to export highlighted notes made from within iBooks
Is there a third-party tool that will allow this?

A: yes there is, if you have a mac.
Get iExplorer here
http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/
plug in your iOS device and use iExplorer to
look in the books file and drag the following files to your desktop.
iBooks.plist  and iBooksData2.plist
and this app
https://github.com/lgoss007/BookmarkExtractor
put the files in the appropriate spot and you can get your highlights

A: Sorry, but (at least currently) there's no way to do this.

A: 3rd party app Digested - does exactly what you need: "Quickly import bookmarks and notes from iBooks on iPhone, iPod, iPad, export to PDF and Evernote..."

A: You can do this on a per-book basis from within iBooks:


*

*Open the book

*Press the "list button" to bring up the Table of Contents

*Switch to the Notes tab

*Press the Share button

*Select Edit Notes

*Select All

*Share via email or some other app.


See this other question for how to do it on macOS.
