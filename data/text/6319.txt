Q: Fixed-width text not appearing correctly in Safari after Lion upgrade I recently updated to Lion, and have found that at least some HTML tagged as <pre> or <tt> shows up looking like this

I've tried changing the fixed-width font in Safari. I've tried rebooting. The same page looks fine in Chrome, and when I copy the text in question out of Safari into BBedit, it looks fine. I'm at a bit of a loss.

A: From Apple Support Communities:

Restart in safe mode than normal boot. If that doesn't do the trick, run Font Book and validate all fonts.


A: This is a known bug. This problem is often because of a bug with Safari 5.1 that appears when you are also using professional font management programs like Linotype FontExplorer and Extensis Suitcase Fusion.
Disable you font management program, clean your font cache, reboot, and check with the company that makes your font management program and see if they have a new update to address working around this new bug.
