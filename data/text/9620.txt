Q: How do I hide 'Hidden' files? I set hidden files to be shown with the following commands:  
defaults write com.apple.finder showHiddenFiles TRUE
killall Finder 
This worked as expected.  Then I tried to hide them again with the following commands:
defaults write com.apple.finder showHiddenFiles FALSE
killall Finder 
This has worked in the past, but it doesn't seem to be working for me today.  All hidden files are still visible in Finder windows.  I tried a reboot and a disk permissions repair to no avail.  I'm not sure what else to try.  Anyone got any bright ideas?

A: Try:
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles false

or with a lowercase f in finder, depending on the version of Mac OS X. And then:
killall Finder
