Q: Jump to the Terminal's right directory from Finder's specific directory

“open terminal here”? 

If I browse my Apple Finder at
/Users/arie/Documents/shugyou/genjutsu/fp

How can I possibly go to Terminal with that very same directory? So that I won't need to do two less productive commands (1) open Terminal from Spotlight, and then (2) type cd /Users/arie/Documents/shugyou/genjutsu/fp. 
I use Mac OS X 10.5.8. Note I don't (want to) use iTerm. TIA.

A: cdto - Finder Toolbar button to open a Terminal window
cdff - Switch Terminal dir to frontmost window of certain apps 

A: You should give that application a try. It works on 10.6 as well as on 10.5 ;-)

A: I use FastScripts and this AppleScript:
tell application "Finder" to set il to insertion location as alias
set cmd to "cd " & quoted form of POSIX path of il
tell application "Terminal"
    activate
    try
        do script with command cmd in window 1
    on error
        do script with command cmd
    end try
end tell


Lion
has services called New Terminal at Folder and New Terminal Tab at Folder:

Built-in systemwide services for Terminal
You can create new sessions based on Finder folders or text paths selected in any application.
