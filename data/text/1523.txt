Q: Where did the Trash icon go on iPhone 4 Mail? In Mail on iPhone 4, with software update 4.2.1, it seems my Trash icon has been replaced with "Move to Folder".  Is there someway to get the Trash icon back, so I can delete messages with one keystroke instead of two?  I use Gmail IMAP.

A: It sounds like you might have the Archive button switched on. The latest update assumes you would prefer to archive than to trash.
If this is the case, Go to Settings > Mail, Calendar, etc.. > Gmail Mail Account > deactivate Archive button.
