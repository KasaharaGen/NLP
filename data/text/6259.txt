Q: Mac Lion - copy and paste leads to files not showing When I copy and paste a file from one folder to another in Finder on my Mac (running Lion), I don't see it. This isn't the first time. I've had lion for a while now and it works fine. But for some reason today, when I copy and paste. I go to paste, and the files just don't show up after I paste. Is my Mac hard drive full or something?
