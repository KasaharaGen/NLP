Q: Is there a comprehensive recurring Notifications / Tasks app for iPhone? I want to have configurable recurring tasks and notifications for those tasks.
Eg, I need to trim the hedge once a week, but it doesn't matter whenabouts in the week that I do it. So I want a task that recurs once a week, but I also want to set the notifications to remind me twice every day until I mark it as done, the task then being dormant until the following Monday when the reminders will continue twice every day until I have clipped the hedge that week.
I notice that NotifyMe for iPhone does more or less this: does it, specifically, allow me to customize when I am reminded?

A: Remember the milk is a popular one. They can do weekly reminders (set for last day of week) and after a week (due 7 days after you complete it).

A: Due provides most of what I'm looking for. 
The developer explains in his FAQ that Apple places restrictions on the number of notifications allowed and when they can repeat. However, the app includes the ability to repeat reminders as well as to "snooze" and/or "postpone" them when they sound.

A: Have a look at Recurring Tasks

Do you have trouble keeping track of all the things you have to do? 
  Do you wish someone reminded you when it's time to change the sheets, make a dentist appointment or renew your subscriptions? 
If so, this Recurring Tasks (RT) app might be just the thing for you! RT helps you keep track of when you did what last and reminds you when you should be doing it again.
