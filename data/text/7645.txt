Q: How can I extract multipart iso files in Mac OS X? E.g.:
part1.iso
part2.iso  
I know The Unarchiver can extract a single ISO file, but how can I extract multipart ISO files?

A: If they are in fact multipart ISO images (instead of two independent ISO files), you can concatenate them at a Terminal prompt:
cat part1.iso part2.iso >part.iso

I have no idea how to do this from a GUI elegantly.  Perhaps wrap that shell command with Applescript?
