Q: Double click windows to minimise in Lion? Before upgrading to Lion I was able to double-click the header bar of windows to minimise the windows. Since upgrading I only seem to be able to minimise by clicking the yellow - button.
Is this a setting that I'm missing?

A: Go to System Preferences > General. Check "Double-click a window's title bar to minimize".
