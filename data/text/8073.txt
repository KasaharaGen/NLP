Q: MacBook Air (mid 2011) running OS X 10.7.2 won't stay asleep I'm running OS X 10.7.2 on a MacBook Air (mid-2011). The computer seems to be waking itself up from sleep. If I go from the black apple in the menu bar and set it to sleep, it wakes up in about 10 seconds. If I let the computer sleep from being idle, then it wakes itself up within four minutes.
Here's what the console output looks like after waking up: 
10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: Wake reason: EHC2
10/13/11 3:07:56.000 PM kernel: The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfa000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2)

10/13/11 3:07:57.000 PM kernel: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to fix this?
The output is more complicated when I have the network on, but I suspect that's unrelated to the actual problem. Here's an example with my ethernet adapter plugged in:

Any thoughts would be really appreciated.
Thanks!

A: The logs say that it's waking from a usb. If you unplug all USB the problem should be fixed.
Also look here to make sure that the option is NOT selected :


A: I'm having the exact same issue and I'm pretty sure this is a hardware-related problem (probably sound) introduced in 10.7.1 or 10.7.2.
That one line always appears in the kernel.log when it wakes up within seconds of putting my iMac to sleep:
kernel[0]: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit

Turning off all sharing preferences did not solve the problem. Nor did reseting the PRAM, SMC or all the other usual suspects I've attempted.

A: I was having the same problem. I disabled the "Internet Sharing" service via Sharing in System Preferences and it immediately solved my problem.
This error in the console also went away:
kernel: Sound assertion "0 == fAudioEngineArray" failed in AppleHDADriver at line 3047 goto Exit


A: I asked a similar question here. I successfully found a working solution:

"Unnecessary sharing services might interrupt the sleep process. Turning these off fixed the problem :)"
