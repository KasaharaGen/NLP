Q: Things to do with a Mac Mini So I just bought a Mac Mini.  Hooked it up to my TV and installed Boxee, Plex (kinda just using boxee tho), and EyeTV.
These are all cool, but I was wondering what else I can do!  It's a powerful little machine, so it'd be interesting to know what other functions people use it for.  
Any suggestions & ideas are much appreciated!

A: My old mini has all my DVDs ripped in iTunes and all my CDs, and many other audio-video files. But there is no limit to what you can do I guess. What was your plan when you bought it? Is it your only computer?

A: Server would be my killer app for a mini in the home.

A: If you have other Macs, get OS X Server from the App Store and use it as a network Time Machine location. More reliable than backing up to a Time Capsule or the somewhat hack-y methods for backing up to non-OS X network shares.
