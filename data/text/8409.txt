Q: Does the iPhone 4 still vibrate in your ear if you receive a text message during a call? With iOS 5 upon us, does the iPhone 4 still vibrate in your ear if you receive a text message (or any kind of notification) during a call?

A: Haven't tried with text messages, but with Whatsapp and emails it does, unfortunately :(
So to answer the second part of your question, yes notifications vibrates during call.

A: I don't know for sure if it vibrates (if silent), but it most certainly plays notification sounds for text messages.
