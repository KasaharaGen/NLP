Q: Downgrading to ios 4.1 from ios 5 without shsh? I am looking for a way to downgrade to ios4 without having SHSH.
I found some tutorial one of this a youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMHvRsplnw
That say it's possibile to downgrade to ios 4.1. Has anyone tested?
I just can stay with ios5, everything has become too slow (especially the standard Music Library of my ipod touch)
Thanks

A: No. Without SHSH blobs it is not possible. And devices running the A5 (iPad 2 and iPhone 4S) it is not possible even with the blobs.
