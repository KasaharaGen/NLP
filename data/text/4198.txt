Q: Do I need drivers to use a full-sized Apple keyboard with my MacBook Pro? I have a 2009 MacBook Pro and just purchased a wired Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad. I really wanted dedicated navigation keys, and it is working great in Eclipse after a bit of configuration. I also wanted proper mappings for Word given how non-standard it feels, and this works well out of the box. I've set up the extra function keys to swap between Spaces - all working fine.
However, in other apps like FireFox, the home and end keys are not working.
Do I need special drivers for the keyboard? I've checked the support site and found nothing relating to my keyboard.

A: Mac OS X home and end keys do not function the same way as they do on other systems.

On Mac, the Home and End keys go to the top and bottom of a document, instead of to the beginning or end of a line. 

Check out this Lifehacker article which shows how to remap the functionality of the home and end keys to make them perform like they do on other systems.
