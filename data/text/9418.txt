Q: How do I compile Doom3? Has anyone compiled doom3, released here:
https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl ?
I have never done something like that before (compile c++/xcode project) and a how-to would be more than welcome.
Also how do I know if it can run in my macbook? 

A: Why would you compile the engine? It is not the full game, so you wouldn't be able to play after compilation.
Anyway, if you're still interested, there's a thread on Hacker News speaking about it, they also mention how to compile the project if you don't have Xcode 3.2
Edit: for what is worth, here the instructions for Xcode 4.
