A: If you are running iOS 5.0.1 (or if you update to iOS 5.0.1 through iTunes), you can use Absinthe to JailBreak your iPad 2. Go to http://greenpois0n.com/ and look for the "JailBreak iOS 5.0.1" table on the right of the page. Choose your download, and enjoy! It's really easy and intuitive to JailBreak with Absinthe. For further reference, you can always check out http://www.jailbrea.kr/ for the latest updates and info. Note that Absinthe is only for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1.

A: You can't. You can only jailbreak iPad 2 till 4.3.3. So your version isn't supported by any of the available jailbreak methods at this moment...
