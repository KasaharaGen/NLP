Q: How can i have makefile/shell script call /Applications/application.app? OS Mac OS X 10.6.6
emacs 23.2.1
I'm currently trying to install magit on carbon emacs using their proposed make solution. I'm an almost complete makefile newby so I might be on the complete wrong path altogether.
Makefile displays:
%.elc: %.el
$(BATCH) --eval '(byte-compile-file "$<")'

which gets expanded to:
emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -eval "(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name \".\") load-path))" --eval '(byte-compile-file "magit.el")'

What I do understand. However it comes back with:
Cannot open load file: subst-ksc

What after a bit of googling reveals some missing libraries. I also realized that the emacs referenced in the expanded command is pointing to /usr/bin/emacs which is one big file, I don't see the normal lisp / site-lisp / etc directories. I also know that my prefered emacs is carbon emacs located in /Application/Emacs.app which just opens when clicking on it, or alternatively, I can open it in with the terminal:
open /Application/MyApp.app

Finally the title question: How can I make Makefile using the Emacs.app on the applications directory? I hope someone here knows the answer, or can point me to alternatives.
regards,
Jeroen.

A: To use the Emacs.app from shell you need the unix executable embedded inside it. It is at Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs (I don't have this version of emacs so the capitalisation might differ)
An alternative is to use open to start any app from the workspace using open.
e.g. 
open -a Emacs.app --args <all those passed to emacs>


A: I'm answering an older question in case anyone else happens across it via Google like I did.
As Mark pointed out, to byte-compile a file using the Emacs.app executable you need to replace emacs or /usr/bin/emacs in the Makefile with /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs. I believe that in general byte-compiled files are not compatible across different versions of Emacs, so when installing a package for use with Emacs.app you should byte-compile it using this executable, not with the default Apple-installed /usr/bin/emacs (which is a version 22 emacs on my 10.6 system).
If you do need to run the /usr/bin/emacs for some other reason, take care that EMACSLOADPATH doesn't contain files belonging to a newer Emacs. This is one potential cause of error messages such as
Cannot open load file: subst-ksc
Invoking emacs from the shell as
EMACSLOADPATH=/usr/share/emacs/22.1/leim:/usr/share/emacs/22.1/lisp:/usr/share/emacs/22.1/site-lisp emacs
should do the trick.
Hope this helps someone else!
