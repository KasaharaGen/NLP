Q: How can I enable internet sharing to work automatically in Mac OS X Lion? After having upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion on my iMac and MacBook Pro, how can I get "Internet Sharing" to work automatically as it did in Snow Leopard? In particular, my iMac gets its internet via a DSL Ethernet connection, and I have enabled internet sharing on it. While my MacBook Pro can see, via wifi, the iMac, every time I awaken the MacBook Pro from sleep, I have to manually select the iMac from the list of available wifi sources and manually re-enter the password.
To attempt to get things to work, I removed the preferred wifi network and then added it back in. I made sure I checked the box that said “Remember networks this computer has joined” in the general preference pane section and also I made sure I checked the box that said “Remember this network” in the specific dialog box for logging in to my iMac-provided network. However, despite, that, when I did the test of putting the MacBook Pro to sleep and awakening it, I still had to manually select my iMac-provided network and provide the password.

A: Under Network on the system preferences, in on the wireless pane on the macbook pro, you should see Preferred Networks. Make sure the iMacs network is on top and all the require administrator authorization to: are unchecked.
