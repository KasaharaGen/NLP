Q: Installing Windows 8 Preview on a Mac? I'm just wondering if anyone has figured this out yet. VMWare throws an ugly "internal monitor error" and there are apparently some graphics driver issues on the 2011 Macbook Pros.

A: Just my luck, VMWare Fusion 4 came out today and I was able to install Windows 8 on that. Boot Camp still has the graphics driver issues, but that's probably not going to resolve itself until Apple gets around to doing an update.
The latest Virtual Box also installs Windows 8 with no issues.

A: Have you tried running it in VirtualBox? I haven't tested this but I had this working with the first beta of Windows 7 back in 2008 and that worked first time! Well, the install did ;)
