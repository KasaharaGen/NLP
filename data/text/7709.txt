Q: iPod Nano keeps going/staying in recovery mode Configuration:
Windows XP Pro + SP3
iPod Nano 1st generation, firmware version 1.3.1
iTunes 10.4.1.10

When I connect the iPod to the PC iTunes says  

iTunes has detected an iPod in recovery mode. You must restore
  this iPod before it can be used with iTunes  

OK, that's what I do. I get a message that  

Your iPod has been restored to factory setting, and is
  restarting. Please leave your iPod connected. It will
  appear in the iTunes window after it restarts.

Then on the iPod the Apple logo appears for a few minutes, which then switches to a "Do not disconnect" message. Again after some time the recovery mode reappears in iTunes. I've cycled through this a few times, even on a different USB port, but no avail. If I disconnect the iPod I can walk through the menus, and reset it. The music of course has gone.  
Is there a way to get the iPod out of recovery mode, other than with the iTunes function?

A: It may be a drive letter conflict in Windows. Go ahead and try the steps listed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1493#changedrive

A: I looked a bit further in it and I found the solution here. It appears the drive letter assigned to the iPod conflicted with another drive. Assigning a free drive letter as on the Apple support page solved the problem.
