Q: Which SSD to choose for a white late 2009 macbook Currently there are many reviews on SSDs, and different types of SSDs as well.
What I would like to hear is what cost effective SSDs that exists that aslo has TRIM support and will work well with Lion.
The System Information app says that the SATA interface can do 3 Gb and the link speed is 1.5 Gb (on the stock 250GB HDD)
I would like around 256 GB.
Which models and brands would be a good choice for this model ?

A: If you don't use your optical drive I would recommend Crucial M4 128GB as best bang for a buck SSD from big name manufacturer. And buying SATA 9.5mm caddy from ebay to put SSD inside it. So you still have your 250GB HDD + 128 GB of SSD

A: I'd highly recommend looking at Other World Computering for this purchase.  I've purchased an SSD from them and they were awesome in helping me figure out which one would work best.  They have great sales and support.  They have a nice option of looking at what is compatible with your mac.
