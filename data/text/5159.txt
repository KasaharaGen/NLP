Q: How can I release and renew my DHCP lease from Terminal? From the Terminal, how can I release and renew my DHCP lease?
Currently, I'm doing the following for the wireless interface, but I'm wondering if there's a better way:
sudo ifconfig en1 down
sudo ifconfig en1 up

For the wired interface, replace en1 with en0.

A: This can also be achieved with the following two commands :
sudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP
sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP

You can alias the two together in your bash profile:
alias renew="sudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP && sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP"

So then you just have one command called renew that will release and renew your DHCP.

A: The way the renew button works in System Preferences is to create a key in the system configuration. One can create the key via:
echo "add State:/Network/Interface/en0/RefreshConfiguration temporary" | sudo scutil

Swapping en0 for the desired interface.
