Q: Does Inkscape work properly with large files on Mac OS? I am not a Mac user yet, but I am used to working with Inkscape on Linux platforms. I use Inkscape to create website mockups and sometimes the files are big and require a lot of RAM. 
I would like to know if someone has some experience working with Inkscape in Mac OS?
I am planning to buy a MacBook but I can't live without Inkscape.

A: Now that I have a Mac to test this with, working with Inkscape it seems to be ok. (I am a web designer and my files are usually several layouts inside the same workspace.)
I have been working on my MacBook Pro for 4 months now without any problems related to Inkscape.
