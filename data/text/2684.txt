Q: Most purchased iOS apps with number of purchases? Where can I find a list of most purchased iPhone / iPad apps WITH the number of buyers?

A: Nowhere, unfortunately, because the information isn't reported anywhere. Individual publishers sometimes announce their sales and/or number of purchases, but it's uncommon and there's no reporting at all from the majority of the most successful publishers.

A: There is no official list (available publicly).
Check the blogs of the various developers of popular apps.  A few developers release this very private financial information.
The typical (median popularity ranking) or random paid app usually sells around 0 units per day.  
According to reports from some analytics aggregators, an app has to get somewhere in the top 10% to 20% in popularity rankings to average $10 or more in sales per day.  The apps in the top 2% make most of the money.

A: There aren't a lot of details around on the web. Camera+ seem to have some fairly detailed sales data on their blog. Have a look here and here. 
As the other answers note, it would only be individual developers releasing data rather than Apple. Although Apple does list rankings for apps but not actual figures.
