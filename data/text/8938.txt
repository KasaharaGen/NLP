Q: Can I hide the sync icon in the menu bar on Lion? This menu bar icon is useless and takes up space.

I use iCloud on Mac OS X Lion to sync contacts, calendars, and the like. On Snow Leopard I could use an option in the iSync preferences to remove this icon from my menu bar, but iSync isn't around anymore. Is there any way to get rid of it?

A: Just âŒ˜ Command-Drag & Drop it away from the menu bar, this way you can also re-arrange your icons. This trick will only work for OSX icons (e.g. Time Machine or WiFi), for non OSX native icons (e.g. Dropbox or GeekTool) you need a third party app like Bartender or Menu Bar Rearranger.

A: That sync icon is also used by MobileMe and another way to get rid of it is to log out of mobileme after migrating to iCloud (System Preferences/MobileMe). I had the same question and finally logged out of mobileme (which wasn't being used anymore) and it disappeared.
