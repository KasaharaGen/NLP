Q: New harddrive, cannot sync my iPad I just got a new hard drive and I want to sync all my iPad stuff back into my iTunes but it's just asking to erase the iPad. I just want all my books and stuff to be back in my iTunes.

A: As I referred to in the comment:


*

*Right/(Control)-Click on iOS device in sidebar of iTunes.

*Select Transfer Purchases
This copies over everything you purchased using the iTMS, App store, and iBooks.
For all content you put on the device that you purchased/received elsewhere, the process is a bit more complicated. Here are some suggestions:


*

*Right/(Control)-Click on iOS device in sidebar of iTunes and select Backup. These at least gives you a place you can quickly fall back on.

*If the computer in-question is a Mac, I can't recommend Podworks enough. 

*If Windows... well I haven't tried any, but found this thread on SuperUser.


Hope this is enough to get you going. Best of luck!
