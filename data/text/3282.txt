Q: How to copy MP3 files from my PC to my iphone? How to copy MP3 files from my PC to my iphone? I have many Mp3 on my PC but  some Mp3s I want to copy in iphone to listen from iphone. How to do that? I'm having itunes account and itunes software on my PC but unable to copy MP3s to iphone.

A: In iTunes under the File menu choose Add to Library... and select the songs you want to add to iTunes. When iTunes is done adding the files, sync your iPhone with iTunes on your PC.
That's all there is to it.

A: With Catalina macOS (1.15+) iTunes is gone.
You will need to open Music application & click under the File and chose Import...
After the mp3 files are imported; you can sync music via Finder by clicking on your iPhone's icon within a Finder's sidebar. Then click Music & check Sync music onto My iPhone.
