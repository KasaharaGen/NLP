Q: Time Capsule stuck on makingbackup disk available I am an IT person, and i have set up two Time capsule and the backup is not working. It just stays stuck. I can use the TC as a file server, no problem. I have tried everything, fixing the backups, erasing the disk, creating the backups again, checking updates...
This ahappened on two separate locations. Same problems.
I can provide with some console but there is not much going on.
Many thanks

A: It had happened to me in the past and I fixed it by rebooting the Time Capsule.

A: Fixed by changing the mac names and TC abem to shorter names.. After 48 H it worked
