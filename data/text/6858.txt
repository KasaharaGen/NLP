Q: How do I remove a dmg from a bootable USB flash drive? I created a bootable flash drive using the instructions on Ubuntu's website using OS X 10.6, but it was for the wrong version of Ubuntu. Now, I want to remove the dmg from the flash drive, but diskutil isn't letting me remove it.

A: Open the USB drive in Finder and delete the contents that way. Then empty the Trash before ejecting the USB drive.
