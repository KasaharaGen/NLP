Q: Stop SuperDrive from checking for disks after wake up I'd like to stop the SuperDrive from spinning up after coming out of sleep since the noise it makes is quite loud. The SuperDrive was 'fixed' at an authorized retailer a while back and it's made a lot of noise ever since. This is a 3 year old white MacBook, so it's out of warranty.
Is there a way to not have it check for disks after opening the lid?

A: You can disable the Superdrive if you set your account up under parental controls.
Under Preferences > Accounts (Users under Lion) > Enable parental controls > other > check limit cd and dvd burning 
This should do the trick.
