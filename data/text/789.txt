Q: View PDF in Preview in Full Screen? Is there any way to view a PDF in Preview in Full Screen? Quick Look works, but it doesn't have the 'remembering the page you were looking at' feature that I like. 

A: View > Slideshow (or Shift+Command+F).

A: Install MegaZoomer, it'll give you nice fullscreen viewing in Preview.
Update: Note that OS X Lion will give you this feature.

A: ctrl+cmd+f
by using this combination, you can also zoom in pages in fullscreen.
