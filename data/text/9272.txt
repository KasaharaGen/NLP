Q: Paralells Desktop changes default Application to play .mp4 files Even though I have selected the option "Always Open with" Quicktime Player for my .mp4 files. The changes never take effect and instead when I open a video, parallels desktop launches Windows Media Player.
Is anyone experiencing the same problem?
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks

A: Have you tried same with Info (Cmd-I). This is better way to change default program. Also I've stopped sharing anything else than folders between Windows & Mac since upgraded to Parallels Desktop 7. It helps much also.
