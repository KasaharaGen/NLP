Q: Is there a cost for submitting an application to the AppStore? I already own my developer programmer account for which I paid the $99 per annum. 
I understand that it allows me to develop and test on the device(s) and to submit applications to the Store.
However, I wonder if there is another associated cost on the submission of the application, and per application. 
I am also aware that the process could be rather long, so I am also asking, if, for any reason the application is rejected, are there any fees or cost related to re-submission.
Thanks.

A: So long as your USD99 annual membership fee for Mac Developer Program is current (and you don't break the Agreement or any NDA), that paid membership already covers the following typical software distribution costs:


*

*set up your App ID for distributing your app

*set up and download credentials needed to sign the app for distribution via the App Store.

*keeping your tax information and deducting the appropriate withholding on apps sold for selected countries' App Store.

*review of your app

*hosting of your app (at App Store)


etc.

A: Submission for review and ultimately the hosting on the App Store are all included in your developer subscription.
