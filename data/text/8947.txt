Q: How do I compile and install a Cydia app? I have downloaded iSwipe from Cydia and I really like it, but it lacks a dictionary of italian words. I have found the original github repository of iSwipe and it gives access to the code.
I would like to modify it to allow for the use of multiple languages, but I have never programmed any iPhone apps nor I know how to compile them and run them as Cydia apps. 
Apart from forking the repository and modifying the code to my fit my needs, which I know how to do, could anybody kindly guide me through the process of compiling it and installing it on my phone to test it?
I am using Windows and don't have access to an OS X workstation, is it still possible?
P.S.: if this is the wrong site for this question, please move it. Thanks. 

A: Install iFile for your iPhone/iPod/iPad/whatever(the free version will do) and navigate to /var/mobile/Wynd/Swype . There you can find the dictionary and you can edit however you want.
Now I have a question for you, where will you find the complete dictionary of words? :)
