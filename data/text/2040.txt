Q: Space in Volume Name; can you remove? I have two drives in my machine:


*

*An SSD with the OS on it

*a HDD with all my data. 


I have a symlink on the SSD for my home directory on the HDD so /Volumes/SSD/Users/Ross/ points to /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/Ross. The Macintosh HD drive is the original boot disk. I'm trying to get rid of the space in the volume name, but when I do I get all kinds of errors. I thought it was a simple as updating the symlink but it doesn't seem to be.
I tried just option-clicking the drive and renaming, which worked but I started to get a lot of application errors.  For example, Terminal won't even open. Also, a lot of the Ruby gem installers don't handle spaces well.

A: Yes, you can remove it, but you'd need to Reboot for it to take effect.
I don't recommend renaming it - the vast majority of applications handle the space just fine. 
If you have a handful of problematic programs, then just create a soft link to your desired location:
sudo ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Ruby\ Stuff /Ruby
