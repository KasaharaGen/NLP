Q: MacBook keyboard mod? Is it possible to mod the MacBook keyboard to be backlit? Is there any website or business that can help or would do it for me?

A: you can always try to find yourself from this FlickR Photos and set it up :)

How I used the backlighting from a macbook air, to give my white macbook a backlit keyboard.
You couldn't just change the whole keyboard, they're not compatible, but the lighting sheet fits.
Then you have to get nearly 16 volts from a step-up-converter to power the 5 white LEDs and add some electronics for switching it on/off and regulate the keyboard-brightness by the screen-brightness.
If you wanna have a backlit keyboard and think about doing it on your own: forget it and buy a new macbook with integrated backlight.
You would almost destroy your macbook in the process...
