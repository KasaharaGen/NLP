Q: Sync iCloud TV show purchases between AppleTV and iTunes How do I sync AppleTV purchases from iCloud to iTunes?
I recently purchased the most recent episode of Psych on my Apple TV but am unable to transfer it to iTunes.
I was able to do this with a previous episode but can't recall how.
I've tried going to Store > Check for Available Downloads... but it says I don't have anything to download:

I am using the same Apple Store account between the Apple TV and iTunes.

A: Go to the iTunes store homepage and click "Purchased" in the Quick Links section. This will bring you to a list of all content that is available for redownload for your account.
