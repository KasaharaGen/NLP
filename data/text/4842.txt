Q: Google Calendars disappeared in iCal Suddenly, since today (not having installed todays OSX Update to 10.6.8, so still running 10.6.7), my Google Calendars ('delegates') have disappeared from iCal.
Strangely, I found them in the Window menu, where they are all listed. When I clen one of them there, iCal opens a new Window with only that calendar showing.
I want the combines view back, as it always was - where all calendars are shown at the right and can be selected for being displayed in the main pane.
Any ideas?

A: I found a solution: in the iCal preferences âŒ˜ + , 
From the accounts Tab: 


*

*Select the caldav server

*go to the "Delegation" Tab. 


There, all delegate Calendars are listed. Select the check marked for all calendars to be shown. 
I have no idea how this setting got disabled, though.
