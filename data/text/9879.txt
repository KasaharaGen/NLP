Q: How can I move the Downloads toolbar button in Safari 5.1 and newer on OS X? In Safari 5.1 on my Mac, the Downloads button appears on the toolbar at the right of the search bar when you download a file for the first time:

I want to move that button elsewhere on the toolbar, so I open View > Customize Toolbar... and drag it to where I want it. The other toolbar controls move to make way for the new spot, but when I drop it, nothing changes; the Downloads button returns to its original position.
Interestingly, I don't have this problem on Safari 5.1 on Windows; I can move the button anywhere I want. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with these observations:


*

*The list of downloads appears as a window on Windows, but as a popover on OS X.

*The Downloads button appears by itself in the Customize Toolbar window on Windows, but not on OS X, where it only appears in the default toolbar set instead.


How can I reposition the Downloads button in Safari on OS X?

A: Drag the other controls around it; as long as you don’t grab the Downloads button itself this will work.

A: 
I managed it—look at the picture above! Right-click → Customise Toolbar and move the URL bar out, then move it back in on the right.
