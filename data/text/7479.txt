Q: Why can't I open Dropbox via Launchpad? The Dropbox app is shown in Launchpad. When I click on it's icon to launch it nothing happens and I return to my browser.  Is this normal?

A: Dropbox has no "Window" to speak of. Everything it does takes place either:


*

*On Dropbox.com

*Via the Finder in the configured Dropbox folder (NB: right click a file in the Dropbox folder), simply named 'Dropbox' in your home directory by default. Or;

*In the MenuBar



Per Dropbox's Documentation, the primary states will be a blue icon with circular arrows indicating a file is synchronizing, or the green checkmark icon like above, indicating everything is up to date.

A: There is no dropbox app - it runs in the background - There is an icon on the menu bar.
