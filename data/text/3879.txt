Q: 'Travelling Salesman Problem' solver app for iPhone Is there iPhone App to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for real world addresses? 
I found solver for OSM data?
But I can not find in repo sources for iPhone.

A: Nothing is remotely close. I'd watch the Wolfram Alpha app as they'd be my obvious choice for someone that would enable a "mail the data" to their servers for a solution.
iOS is certainly powerful enough to solve this class of problems, but we're still waiting for someone to invest the time in releasing an "app for that".
