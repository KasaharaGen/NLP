Q: How does one make screen captures with a shadow? How to do beautiful print screens, with shadows on the border, like this image?

Is the shadows automatic? A Mac tool? Do I need to manipulate the image in other programs like Adobe Photoshop?

A: No, you do not need to. This feature is built into Mac OS X.
To do this, press âŒ˜+Shift+4 then press Space. The selector will then change into a camera icon, and you can take a screenshot of the selected window with a shadow.

(I couldn't capture the camera icon)
End result:


A: Actually I prefer NOT to capture with the shadow at all. There is a command line procedure for suppressing the shadows, but you can accomplish the same thing through the GUI of TinkerTool.

Install TinkerTool and then under its "General" tab, un-check the box next to "Include shadow when capturing window".

A: The shadows aren't automatic.  There is a free tool called ImageShadowAdder that can do these for you.
