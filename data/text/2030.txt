Q: App to video chat between iPod Touch 4 and Android phone? I am looking to do a video chat between an iPod Touch 4 and an Android phone (not sure which version, but less than a year old).  Both of these devices have video cameras and microphones, I'm just not sure the easiest way to video chat between the two.  Any suggestions?

A: Yahoo! Messenger, Skype or Fring should do.

A: Tango will also work.
