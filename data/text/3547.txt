Q: How to display/alter a jailbroken iOS device's route table? I jailbroke my iPhone4 and want to display and alter the route table on my iPhone. There is a route command, but I don't know the parameters needs to display/alter the route table.
I've googled a lot but still cannot find a clue. I know how to display/alter route table in Linux, but obviously the route command in iOS is not like the same command in Linux. Hope someone can answer this question.
Note: the iOS is the iOS of Apple, not the IOS of Cisco :-)
This command comes from package _network_cmds_ in Cydia.
The default output without any argument:
yeglemato-iPhone:~ root# route
usage: route [-dnqtv] command [[modifiers] args]

A: Use netstat -r to display route table and route to alter it.
You can read netstat and route man page on OSX for more information. I think they are the same BSD route version.
