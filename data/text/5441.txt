Q: Is it possible to use an Apple gift card toward repairs? I have a gift card whose balance should just about exactly cover the cost of some repairs Apple is doing on my computer. Is it possible to spend a gift card on repairs? I assume so, but I cannot find any confirmation on Apple's website. Just wondered if anyone on here had any experience to confirm or disconfirm. 

A: If the card can be used in an Apple retail store (i.e. not an iTunes gift card), then yes. Repairs are treated as an in-line item in their POS system. Any valid form of payment that could be used to pay for anything else in the store can be used to pay for repairs.
I called an Apple retail store to confirm this.

A: From the Apple Gift Card Page:

The pressure's off. Now your friends and family can choose almost
  anything that Apple offers in its huge collection of Mac and iPod
  products at any Apple Store in the United States - online, by phone,
  and at an Apple Store near you. Just give an Apple Gift Card and the
  recipient can choose from qualifying products.

Clearly just for buying a subset of products, not for repairs.
