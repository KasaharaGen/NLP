Q: Media player that plays .m4v files? If I wanted to play some .m4v files (non-DRM Apple TV as they're produced through Handbrake), what would be the best HD Media Player to play back the files?
Would this one work?

I've heard bad things about this player though, so wondering if there's one that would play .m4v as well as the usual .avi, .mpg etc. and codecs as shown in that link?
Just looking for something reliable that will play those sorts of files.
Thanks

A: A PS3 will do a great job of it. That's what I use. The only downside is that a PS3 won't natively play mkv files, but you can use PS3 Media Server to live-transcode and stream from your computer to the PS3.

A: i have a roku xd|s and it plays mp4, mkv, m4v and wmv very well!
i should follow up -- i my roku with roksbox to stream media off my laptop to my television.  handbrake will also convert all those pesky formats it doesn't support to the correct versions.
i've got a decent encoding profile set up in handbrake if you're interested.
the xd|s also allows a usb drive attached which will allow local playback of mkv/h264 files.
we are so happy with ours we actually got rid of cable (hulu plus and netflix and amazon vod)

A: iTunes will play them. According to this iTunes: Frequently asked questions about viewing and syncing videos:
