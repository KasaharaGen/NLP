Q: Update Apple ID to iCloud @me address I previously had an Apple ID account, and I logged in using my gmail address. Now I have a @me.com address and I'd like to use that to log in.
How can I change the address I log into my Apple ID account (e.g. when downloading apps) to my new @me address?

A: Does this help?
How to change the name you use for your Apple ID


*

*At My Apple ID, click "Manage your account."

*Sign in using your current Apple ID and password.

*With the Name, ID, and Email Address drawer selected, click Edit next to your Apple ID.

*Enter your new Apple ID in the Apple ID field. You should use your primary email address as your Apple ID. 


You can change a non-me.com address, but you cannot change a me.com address to something else.
Do you want to change what ID you use for iTunes and AppStore purchases?  


*

*Open iTunes

*Click Store

*On the menu, you will see View My Account, followed by the account which is signed in.  If the account is your .me account, you are done.

*You are signed in with something other than your .me account.  So, sign out.

*Sign in with the .me account you want to use.  You are done.  

*Repeat as appropriate on the AppStore and on all your other devices.
