Q: What new iPhone App that lets you maintain a single list, star items and sort them? There was a new iPhone app released recently but I can't recall its name. It had some very simple features:


*

*Keep a single list of things

*Star items

*Sort those items so that stars rose to the top


What was its name? The app in question is not 1list.

A: Figured it out, it was LittleList

A: I was guessing it was Wunderlist.
