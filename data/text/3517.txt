Q: Huge fonts in Skype 5.1 I have huge fonts in the messaging window, and there I can't find a configuration item to change it.
It's the new Skype 5.1 for Mac.
Why did this happen, and how can I restore the fonts to their normal sizes?

A: If you are having an application issue on Mac OS X, and it is not something that is expected behavior, a good first step is to quit the program, remove the user specific .plist files for that application, and then relaunch it. If regenerating the .plists doesn't work, it is probably time to reinstall Skype. 
If this change is just a result of intended behavior (i.e. an update changed the way the program works), I recommend uninstalling and downloading a previous version to your liking.
