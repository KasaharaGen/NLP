Q: Which apps support the vga adapter for iPad 1? iPad 2 supports full mirroring, which is great, but I have an iPad 1. How do I find out which apps support the vga adapter on iPad 1. I have failed to find a definitive answer.
For example maps, safari, google earth, photos.
I have seen references to video and itunes supporting it, but not fully.
Which apps have you used with the VGA adapter, and which features does it support?

A: I just tried it, Sketchbookx, Bamboo paper and pdf-notes work with iPad1 (not jailbroken) with VGA connector.  

A: Keynote does, and works ok. 
Beyond that I would not expect that any app supports it unless explicitly noted in the app's description.
It takes extra effort for the developer to support VGA output, so unless they see a market for it, they usually won't do. Even then usually you don't have the same view on your VGA screen as on your iPad.
