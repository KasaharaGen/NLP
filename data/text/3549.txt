Q: iPhone won't connect to wifi My iPhone will not connect to my wireless router, even when I put the password in.
How do I troubleshoot this problem?

A: Checking the obvious - you can connect to WiFi on another computer right? The iPhone frequently over-reports the strength of the WiFi connection, so you can see 2 or 3 bars but not actually connect because it times out.
Try holding the iPhone vertically with your fingers at the top and bottom - the WiFi receiver is in the side, so when you hold it with your hands at the sides, it reduces WiFi reception.

A: I recently solved this problem. Several mobile devices (including the iPhone) just simply won't connect to a network that is broadcasting WPA/WPA2 simultaneously. You have to choose either WPA or WPA2 and then they will connect no problem.
