The browser doesn't show videos on Youtube 

Youtube videos appear as a black box only in safari 5.0.3, since flash payer has been updated to 10.2. They work if I change the User Agent to Safari 4.0.3 using the Developer menu, but this is not permanent.
Flash Player 10.1 is no longer downloadable, so I don't know how to downgrade. User agent setting are not permanent, or I don't know how to set them fixed.
Maybe, it is a bug in YouTube embedding, because Flash sites like that from Adobe work. I am relativly sure that the new flash plugin is the problem, because I have to macbooks with OS X 10.6.6 and Safari 5.0.3. The only difference if the version of the flash plugin: 10.1 shows youtube videos, 10.2 not.
I'm not sure the flash version is the reason. ALso the working mac has been installed with OS X 10.6 from scratch, the not working has been updated from an 10.5.

A: I had this problem while running ClickToFlash 1.6b9 (the original general browser plug-in, not the Safari 5.x extension). Even with ClickToFlash  disabled via the checkbox in ClickToFlash's preferences, it still happened. I ended up dragging the ClickToFlash plug-in out of /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ and restarting Safari, and it went away.

A: Try to start Safari in 32Bit mode (right click on it, chose "information" and check "32-bit mode". 
Another idea: uninstall flash completely so safari should display HTML5 videos in youtube without a plugin.
Hope, that helps!

A: I can't fix the bad version of Flash that you have, but I can offer a solution to get YouTube working. YouTube supports formats other than Flash. If you are using Safari, download and install this Safari 5 Plugin called YouTube5
Once this extension is installed in Safari 5, when you go to the YouTube site, instead of getting flash videos you get a custom HTML5 player. Works great and I don't miss flash.
Here is a screen shot of how I have it setup in my Safari 5 Extensions panel of Preferences.

Hope this helps!
