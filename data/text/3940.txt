Q: Saving .htacess passwords on iPad I know it is possible to save form username/passwords on the iPad's Safari browser. The thing I can't do is to save .htaccess username and passwords. In case you don't know what those are, it's when a webpage is protected and you can't even see the page without authenticating. It usually displays a popup window so you can authenticate.
Is it possible to save this type of credentials?

A: This is HTTP Authentication and the iPad cannot "remember" the credentials of these sorts of logins.  It has no problems with a normal web form however.
If you are happy to have your username and password stored in plain text on a bookmark in Safari however, there is a way to allow you to login without filling out those details again.
Just visit the site with the following formatted url :
http://username:password@domain.com/

Rememer to change the 3 obvious variables (username, password and domain).  This should log you straight in.  You can save this as a book mark and then use that going forward.
The username and password must be URL encoded if they contain any special characters.
Just remember that anyone who picks up your iPad could view the bookmarks and see the clear text username and password, so I wouldn't use this on your banks website :)
Hope this helps.

A: For a more secure solution, I'd suggest 1Password for iPad. It has many useful features, not the least of which are auto-generation of strong passwords (so you can use a different password on each site) and strong encryption of your passwords. You can use 1Password with HTTP Authentication.
