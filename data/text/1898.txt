Q: How can I find which account I used for downloading my iOS apps? I use three different accounts for downloading from the App Store, each in a different country.
When there is an update, I have to connect to the correct App Store to download the update, but sometimes I can't remeber from which store an app was downloaded and so I need to connect to each one in turns.
I would like to be able to find the account I used to download an app so that I can connect to the correct App Store immediately. Also, this would enable me to verify if the app already exists in the App Store of my main account and buy/download it from there. 

A: In iTunes you can simply right click the app in question and choose Get Info. On the summary tab you can see the account used to purchase the app.


A: I would log in to each account and check your purchase history. That seems like the most direct way to me. This Apple article has details on how to do this.
