Q: OS X Leopard profile hangs on load ON a current project, and really need help. Re-install would be a painful option right now.
Running OS X 10.5.8 and just downloaded and reinstalled compbo update.
Yesterday installed latest version of evernote and now having all types of problems. Don't think it was evernote, but actually GROWL. 
If I login in with my creds, it takes over 20 min to load my profile. If I login with dummy acct, it loads in less than 2 min. Applications launch but every couple of mins hangs for @ 4-5 min.
Ran permmisstions repair and disk repair twice. Some problems where found but fixed.
Disabled all startup apps from Accounts. What else can I do?
EDIT - 
Just started in verbose mode again and ran /sbin/fsck -fy again.  the same error came out.  After Checing Catalog file, it said Incorrect block count for file 2011.04.18.U501.asl (It should be 734 instead of 367).

A: In addition to what you've already done, temporarily move any system wide startup items from /MacintoshHD/Library/StartupItems using Finder.
If you have done this, and removed startup items from your own account, repaired the disk, then there is really nothing else that should be slowing down the startup.
If you cannot log in to your profile, you may need to start in safe mode (hold down shift whilst booting).
