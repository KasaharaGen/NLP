Q: What is the .plist.lockfile introduced in Lion? 
Possible Duplicate:
Why are my plists in ~/Library/Preferences accompanied by a matching lockfile in Lion? 

Since upgrading to Lion, I have noticed that Lion is placing lockfiles that correspond to the plist in ~/Library/Preferences. For example, in this folder I have both com.apple.finder.plist and com.apple.finder.plist.lockfile.
Any idea what these files are there for? I know what lockfiles are in general, but I dont understand why they may have been introduced in Lion.
