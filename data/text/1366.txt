Q: Where can I download old iOS versions from Apple? I need to test my app with older version of iOS and can't find exactly where to download them from Apple.
Anybody know the adress?

A: As far as I'm aware Apple doesn't offer the links directly, but iClarified has a complete list of iOS downloads for all models of iPhone available here. It came in handy when I downgraded my old 3G back down to 3.1.3

A: Go to https://ipsw.me Here you can download so many .ipsw
