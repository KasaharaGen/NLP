Q: How can I stop com.apple.launched from attempting to start a service we uninstalled? My office used to use JungleDisk Workgroup service to exchange large files. We've moved on to a new solution and I uninstalled the client according to their instructions, but I noticed today in the Console that com.apple.launchd is trying to start JungleDisk every 10 seconds. It fails, but I can't help but think this is causing some performance issues.
Where/how do I remove a background service launch?

A: If you want to use a software, you can try Lingon.
It allows you to manage (create, edit, delete) all the launchd items on your system.
Otherwise, if you want to go by hand, look inside the following folders :


*

*/Library/LaunchAgents

*/Library/LaunchDaemons

*~/Library/LaunchAgents

A: The manual method (Lingon in Studer's question is a great GUI for this) is to unload the job from launchd:
Run sudo launchctl stop com.jungledisk.workgroupservice to tell launchd to stop running the job but it's important to note the job will just come back the next time you restart. You can then try and track down the file in /Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons or ~/Library/LaunchAgents - if you delete the file it won't load the next time you restart the computer. If you run sudo launchctl unload /PATH/TO/com.jungledisk.workgroupservice.plist this will unload the job and then you can delete the file since you don't require it anymore.
