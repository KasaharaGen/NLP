Q: How do I forward a meeting request from my iPhone? I have synced my mail and calender to our company's MS Exchange 2003 server using Outlook Web Access(OWA). I have received a meeting request that I wish to forward to someone. How do I do this using the default mail app? (iOS 4.3.1)

A: There is an app for that.  It is called "Forward My Meeting."
