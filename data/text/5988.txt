Q: For applications that do not store Quick Look information within the file, where does Lion (or a Server) store that information? Some applications can store Quick Look information (previews and thumbnails) within the file. Others can not. 
Two aspects to this question
For a file that is local and without integral Quick Look information: 


*

*where does Lion store that information?


For a file that is remote, on an AFP server (Mac OS X Server (Leopard)/AFP 3.2+ or greater) and without integral Quick Look information: 


*

*does Server store the information remotely?


(An AFP client can cache some information locally, with limitations, but I strongly suspect that there must be a more permanent store.)
Initial guesses
Much Quick Look information is stored in the attributes B-tree. 
If so, an attributes B-tree in a more modern version of Mac OS X Server may be potentially better (than older versions of Server) for AFP clients where bandwidth is limited. 
Please, does anyone have more definite answers?

Meta
Quick Look (two words, in Finder and elsewhere) seems more proper than QuickLook. 

A: Graham - quick look generate the data on the fly. The inspectors know to use the previews when present, but will do the heavy lifting when needed.
The virtual memory system of course caches these files so it feels faster after the first render until it swaps out or gets disposed if the pages are not marked for a swap to disk.

A: com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache
In combination with qlmanage, using fs_usage and fseventer drew attention to the following directory: 
/private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/
Whether this is used for previews as well as thumbnails, I don't know. 
A Google search for com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache found (amongst other things) FileVault and QuickLook leak some information from encrypted volumes (2010-07-25) with a comment, 

Thumbnail cache is disabled for encrypted volumes, including file
  vault users. You should be able to confirm with following terminal
  command:
qlmanage -m disks
…

For FileVault 2 in Lion, that may be no longer true. 
I do have thumbnails.data outside my home directory, 42M, a reset using qlmanage does not reduce its size:
