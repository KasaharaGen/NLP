Q: How can Time Machine in Lion backup the volume content of a sparse bundle disk image? Using Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511), attempts to backup volume content with Time Machine have failed. 
With a simple non-encrypted image I tried three approaches: 


*

*the traditional workaround, which reportedly works on Snow Leopard

*the removeexclusion verb of tmutil in Lion

*(1) and (2) combined.


This leaves the question: 
How can Time Machine backup .sparsebundle volume content?


*

*content of the volume, not the bands of the image.


Differences between Snow Leopard and Lion
Finder preferences
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist
Within this file, the FXRecentFolders key contains an array of data. 
Opening the required volume in Finder, then closing the window causes volume-related data to be written as a sub-key: 


*

*file-data sub-keys in Snow Leopard

*file-bookmark sub-keys in Lion. 


Time Machine preferences
/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist
The removeexclusion verb of tmutil (manual page not yet published by Apple): 


*

*seems to add — to the IncludedVolumes array of com.apple.TimeMachine.plist — key data that differs from the data found in com.apple.finder.plist

*does not add a corresponding key string to the IncludedVolumeUUIDs array.


Relevant commands
For a volume named myVolume
defaults read com.apple.finder FXRecentFolders | grep --before-context=1 myVolume
diskutil information /Volumes/myVolume | grep UUID
A similar question, asked in 2010
How can I get Time Machine to back up the contents of a File Vault while logged in?


*

*that 2010 question focuses on FileVault 1 encrypted home directories in Snow Leopard

*this 2011 question, not focused on FileVault, is more broadly about content of volumes attached from sparse bundle disk images in Lion.
