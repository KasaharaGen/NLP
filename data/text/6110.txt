Q: Find information about host IP address? Is there anyway to ping a computer's IP and find out some basic information about it? Platform, OS, etc...
If so, how would that be done?

A: Using nmap from MacPorts you can run the following command to attempt to identify the OS of a remote machine:
sudo nmap ipaddress -O
e.g.:
$ sudo nmap localhost -O

A: WakeOnLan is a GUI based app that can give some of this information. Additionally it scans the network and lists all devices. It doesn't have any success recognizing Linux based machines.
