Q: How can I enable pinch to zoom in Finder on OS X Lion? After upgrading to Lion the pinch-to-zoom seems to be gone in Finder.  Didn't even find an option for it in system preferences. Any ideas?

A: The preference for this used to be located in Finder>Preferences. It's no longer available and after some research online, it looks like no one has discovered a way to turn this on using a plist edit.
