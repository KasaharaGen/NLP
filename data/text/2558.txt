Q: Is there a way to add To-Do's to iCal from the iPhone? Is there a way to add To-Do's to iCal from the iPhone?

A: With iOS5 and iCloud, iCal's reminders appear in the Reminders app.

A: Not until Apple decides to release this feature.
There are tons of 3rd party applications that sport some kind of To-do list, some can even sync with your iCal.
I don't use To-do's on my phone so I can't name any alternative apps.
