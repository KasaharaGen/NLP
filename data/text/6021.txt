Q: Will renaming my Windows partition from BOOTCAMP break anything? I've installed Windows 7 via BootCamp. I'd like to rename the partition from BOOTCAMP to something a little easier on the eyes. Will renaming my Windows partition from "BOOTCAMP" to "Windows" break anything? (Should I do it from the Windows side or the Mac side?)

A: It won't break anything. Only issue is that if you're using a FAT partition, the name will be all capitals. Rename from either Windows or OS X if you have an appropriate driver installed.

A: I agree that it should not break anything. I would do it while booted into Windows, because I would assume that Windows would know to make sure the change is reflected anywhere else it is necessary.
(I'm not an expert on Windows but I did rename my BOOTCAMP partition under Snow Leopard without any negative results.)
