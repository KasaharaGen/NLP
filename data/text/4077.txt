Q: How do I install an application for just one user? How do I install an application for just one user, without using administrative permissions or affecting any other users?

A: Just put the application in the home of the user. You could create folders like this for every user:
/Users/<username1>/Applications
/Users/<username2>/Applications

and put the application(s) there.
