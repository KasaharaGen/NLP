Q: OSX 10.7.2 can't shut down When i click on shutdown nothing happens. I've tried repairing and verifying the hard-disks. Rebooting in safe mode, resetting PRAM, SMC. Nothing seems to work.
The only 2 ways i can shutdown now is by pressing and holding the power button and typing "shutdown -h now" in terminal. Can anyone help me?
