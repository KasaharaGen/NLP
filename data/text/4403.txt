Q: applescript (osascript) for changing Terminal.app profile Is here a way to changing the Terminal.app profile from the command line?
Here is already couple of questions about changing colors, but I need change the whole profile from the "Basic" (what is my default) to "Homebrew" or "Pro" from the shell script.
Looking for only clean command-line solution (e.g. without clicks, global shotcuts etc.), so probably with osascript. Need it because want change the Terminal.app behavior when ssh-ing into another computer, e.g. font-size, encoding, colors, emulation - the whole profile - not only colors.
Like something next:
some_commands_here to change the CURRENT terminal profile into another
ssh user@example.com

And no, I don't want use iTerm2. :)
Ps: ok, as the last resort, shortcuts are acceptable, but no clicks. :) :)

A: $function setTerm() { PROFILE=${1}; echo "tell app \"Terminal\" to set current settings of first window to settings set \"${PROFILE}\""|osascript; };

When you connect to a remote computer using ssh, the terminal.app settings will set according to the remote bash profile. Therefore you need to define the preferred settings on the remote machine first.
