Q: after transferring information from time capsule to new MacBook Pro iTunes/AppStore stop working I choose to use a time capsule to initialize my new MacBook Pro. All went well until I tried to use applications bought from the AppStore. Some of them don't start and eventually ask me for my Apple ID. After some time it gives this:

The AppStore gives the same connection failed and the iTunes gives me "The network connection timed out" 

A: It appears that was a problem with the AppStore and iTunes connection but it is working now.
Some applications worked when the connection work, but two didn't work until I deleted the application and let the AppStore to install them again
