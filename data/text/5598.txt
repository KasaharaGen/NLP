Q: How can I find out which generation my iPod belongs to? I have a iPod Classic 160 Gb. I have forgotten the generation. Is there any way by which I can find out the generation of the iPod?

A: See Apple's note on identifying which iPod model you have.

A: Check out MacTracker.  It's a free app with information on pretty much everything that Apple has ever made.
