Q: How can I type the "@" symbol via remote desktop with a Swedish keyboard? I am running Remote Desktop to connect from my iMac with Snow Leopard to a Windows box at work that runs Windows 7 Professional. The connection is done over ssh.
When logged in to the window box I can use Alt + Tab to switch between programs, I can also see that when using emacs pressing Alt registers as Meta (which is what I have set it up as). However if I want to type a @ which on my Swedish keyboard is Alt + 2 nothing happens. The same is true for { and [ and so on.

A: Does  ⌘ + alt + 2 work? This is a combination for @ in bootcamp.
For the other keys: 


*

*⌘ + alt + 7  to get {

*⌘ + alt + 0  to get }

*⌘ + alt + 8  to get [

*⌘ + alt + 9  to get ]


A: Ctrl+Alt+2 did the trick for me (on Swiss German keyboard).

A: On my keyboard alt-G also did not work, however, alt-E works for the EURO sign. After some trying I found the alt-Q is the solution for the at (@) sign on the remote desktop (which is a Windows system).

A: Perhaps you could set up another keystroke to produce @ via system preferences/language & text/text/symbol and text substitution.

A: Perhaps not an answer, but on a UK keyboard @ and " swap places from Mac to Windows
 Shift ⇧   2   is @ on Mac, " on Win
 Shift ⇧   '  is " on Mac, @ on Win

A: You could use the character palette.
System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard tab
Check "Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar"
(If necessary, press Input Sources... and enable Keyboard & Character Viewer)
Then open the Character Viewer from the menu bar, locate the character you need, and double-click it to insert it.

A: I use Cord and Danish keyboard and I get the ampersand (&) using
Right-alt + right-cmd + 2.

A: alt gr (the alt symbol on the right hand side) plus semicolon worked for me

A: Shift + ± worked for me when I typed all the characters on the keyboard using Shift key

A: alt + 0 worked for me. (under mac its produce ø, under vm win7 its produce @)
