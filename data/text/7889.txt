Q: What makes the iPhone video encryption so tough? It seems that there isn't a single iPhone app that does video encryption.
There are a lot of "privacy" apps that "protect" videos and photos with a password and without encryption and there are some apps that actually do AES encryption of photos, but absolutely none that would do the AES encryption of videos.
Why might this be? Is it performance or resource related?

A: Two explanations:


*

*Video files are significantly bigger than your usual iPhone picture -> encryption would take a very long time

*No real need (aka market)
