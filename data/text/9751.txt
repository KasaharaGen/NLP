Q: RSS reader and archiver application? I am looking for a decent RSS reader app that would double up as an archiver. It would let me flag any posts that I find valuable for PERMANENT storage in a database. Even when the blog is no longer online, this application would let me browse and read the articles I've saved, for YEARS to come.
So I am really looking for the ability to backup RSS posts. Reading offline is only a side effect. I want to be able to flag some of my feeds for permanent storage too, so I don't need to flag each post individually.
Some of the blogs I have been following on personal development topics have a distinct voice and just won't be replaced. Unfortunately, as I have found out blogs (and forums) do disappear. And with them, a treasure trove of information that would have continued to be useful to me for years to come.
Does a solution exist on OS X or iOS?

A: Newsfire archives entries as long as you want it to.
