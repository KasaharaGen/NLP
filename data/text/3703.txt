Q: Control-F2 "Move Focus to Menu Bar" only works occasionally I don't want to use my trackpad too much due to a strain injury, hence I use the Control F2 "Move Focus to Menu Bar" a lot.
However this feature only works occasionally, it can work for hours and then suddenly stop working, sometimes I can fix in the Keyboard Shortcuts pref pane by unchecking and checking the "Move Focus to Menu Bar" checkbox, at other times it takes a restart of the system.

I'm a big Apple fan-boy, and I always marvel at the cool features in OSX, this is the first time I have a Windows-esque experience with the OSX UI :(

A: When you're sure you've got your Fn key settings the way you want them and it STILL doesn't work:
My solution:


*

*Go back into Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts pane.

*For the item "Move focus to the menu bar",
assign a DIFFERENT function key, other than F2.
(Something you're not using, like, say...^F9...or whatever.)

*Now use THAT key instead.
Sounds kind of nuts, I know.  And it's annoying to use a different key.  But I've found that ^F2 just won't consistently work after I've been using enough 3rd party programs, particularly if they're complex.  Sometimes ^F3 will also fail, and that keyboard pane can start acting a little strange on its own to be honest.  This does seem to work though.

*I've had the same struggle with keyboard shortcuts to the menu bar (tried many different combinations).


the only one that has consistently worked is the help shortcut ⇧ ⌘ ? (shift+command+/)
from the help menu just use the arrows to navigate to file/edit/view…

A: Same here: ^F2 almost never works
Workaround that works for me (without assigning new shortcut):
press ^F3 and then immediately ^F2 

A: From this other question:
Why do Ctrl+F2 and Ctrl+F3 sometimes stop working?
A possible cause is accidentally hitting Ctrl-F1, which (wait for it...) disables Keyboard access! So use it again to toggle these keys back on.

A: I asked a question in the following link and got a hint to answer your question:

What I do is as follows:


*

*create an .app using Automator using the scrip in the above link,

*create a hot key for the .app,

*create a key stroke linked to the hot key (using KeyRemap4MacBook in my case).


It works great for me at least.
