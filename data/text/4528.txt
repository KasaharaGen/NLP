Q: Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter and Widescreen (FullHD) Monitor Just got myself Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA to connect my early 2011 (pre Sandybridge/Thunderbolt) 15" MacBook Pro to Samsung SyncMaster 2494HM monitor.
The monitor is currently connected to my PC via DVI, so I wanted to use its VGA port to connect my MBP as I frequently need to use them both at the same time and want to avoid shuffling cables.
Anyway, I have a problem with making it work in FullHD (1920x1080 Widescreen, monitor's native resolution).
The widescreen part in particular.
Basically if I choose its native resolution it doesn't fill the whole width of the screen. When I selected it for the first time it was on full width until I clicked Refresh Rate dropdown menu - no changing involved as was only able to use 60Hz anyway). Then, oddly enough, it switched to something between 4:3 and 16:9. So everything is a bit... too narrow.
Interestingly full width widescreen works perfectly on other 16:9 resolutions, but the res is basically too low for the 24" screen.
Anyone has any idea why's that and how to fix it?

A: The solution for me was to hold down the Option key while clicking on the "Scaled" radio button in Display Preferences. That offered many more display resolutions, including widescreen ones.

A: I can't remember where I found the solution for this issue, but I had to remove /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist and restart the machine.
This seemed to reset any remembered displays and the the resolution and aspect ration returned to normal.
