Q: What do I need to set up two DVI monitors on a 2011 Mac mini? As a software developer who recently bought an iPhone, I knew it was just a matter of time before I started dicking around in the iOS apps space. Today Apple released a new line of Mac minis and I am going to buy one. I'd like to just buy a KVM switch and flip between my current two monitor PC setup and the Mac. What kind of adapters do I need for the Mac mini to be able to take two DVI outs?
I've been told that I can use a mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter with the Thunderbolt port then just a HDMI to DVI in the HDMI port, is that possible?

That's what I do with a 2010 mini (MDP instead of TB). 
Yes, it works perfectly.
The tricky part comes if you want three monitors. For that, you need to be sure to buy the video-boosted Mini model that has discrete graphics, or use a (slow) USB video adapter for the third screen. But for two, any modern mini is fine out of the box.

This should be theoretically possible. The only other option I can think of is to get a splitter for the thunderbolt port and get 2 dvi adapters. 

A: I was just looking into hooking up two displays to my yet to arrive Macbook Air and found a Mini DisplayPort | Thunderbolt to DVI (2 DVI Output) Converter.
I don't see why this wouldn't work for the Mac mini as well.
