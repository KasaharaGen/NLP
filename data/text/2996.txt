Q: Can I add my own commands/scripts to the mail.app toolbar? Is there a way (or an add-on) that lets me customize the Mail.app toolbar beyond "View -> Customize Toolbar"? At a minimum, I want to add buttons that do "Move to <somefolder>".

A: I think you can use Mail Act-on for this, it provides Shortcuts for doing stuff with various mails. Not a Visual Shortcut, but a Keyboard one.

Move messages by keystroke only Mail
  Act-On’s interface includes the
  ability to move or copy messages to
  any folders by keystroke, even if you
  don’t have an Act-On rule for a
  particular mailbox.

A: Read CocoaDev: HowToAddButtonsToAppleMail.  It references a page of links to articles/examples on writing Mail.app plugins.  You will also need to do some programming of Mail.app, e.g. using AppleScript - which you can learn more about here.
Here is a year-and-a-half old blog post by a guy who managed to get some useful control over Mail.app from AppleScript.  You might use it as a model. He built his with a third-party module but you might find a way to write your own, if necessary.
The scripting of Mail.app might be stable.  However, from what I have read - the rules for how to construct a Mail.app plugin may be in flux from one major version of Mac OS X to the next.
That could be enough to discourage you from writing what you want for wide distribution but it might not be much of a handicap for personal use.

A: *

*Open Automator 

*File -> New -> Service -> Choose

*Service receive no input in Mail.app

*From library select Utilities -> Run AppleScript

*Insert the code provided below and save under name Move to trash [Gmail] 

*Edit the script and change your account name. Name of the account could be found at Mail -> Preferences... -> Accounts

*Open Mail.app and select Mail -> Services -> Service Preferences...

*Assign a shortcut to the service Move to trash [Gmail]

*Restart Mail.app

*(Optional) You should be able to see the assigned shortcut in the menu 

*Open inbox, select messages to be moved to trash and press the keyboard shortcut*. Messages will be moved to [Gmail]/Trash


*Note: For the first time the script works quite long, but all the following times it should proceed much faster.
AppleScript:
on run {input, parameters}
    tell application "Mail"
        set s to selection
        repeat with i from 1 to the count of s
            set msg to item i of s
            set box to mailbox of msg
            if name of box is not "[Gmail]/Trash" then
                move msg to mailbox "[Gmail]/Trash" of account "<Your account name here>"
            end if
        end repeat
    end tell
end run

This approach does not allow to add a button to the toolbar, but it's very close to what you are looking for.
