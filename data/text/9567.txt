Q: How do i get the low battery warning back on my MacBook? I have a MacBook and I did not take care of the battery properly. It started to shut down unexpectedly at around 20% and then even at 30%. I got a new battery and it seems to work fine; it lets me get down to 6%. The only problem is that even with the new battery, a warning does not pop up telling me that it is time to plug in my computer. I was waiting for it to come up when my computer was at 6%, and instead it just died. I don't know if I need to change some kind of setting or what. Any ideas on how to fix this?

A: I had reset SMC several times and changed my battery once. Unfortunately, my MacBook did not show low battery warning anymore. Then I found
SlimBatteryMonitor, it works for me. You can customize the percentage of battery (if drops below x%) to show the warning panel too.

A: Try resetting the SMC. Details are listed here. You will notice that the symptom you described is listed on that page too as "The computer sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly."
One additional piece of advice. You only need to do this SMC reset once. Don't reset your SMC repeatedly and consecutively. That's not advisable.

A: I'd really recommend Battery Medic
It's completely free and supports notifications based on a battery threshold that you can set
