Q: Is there a way to add shortcuts to open a particular folder in Save Dialogs and Finder Windows? I know that when you're saving or opening a file ⌘ shift D shoots you to the Desktop folder, and pressing ⌘ shift D whilst using finder shoots you to the desktop folder as well. 
Is there a way to create a custom shortcut to jump to your own choice of folder? (e.g. ⌘ shift W for your 'Work' folder).

A: By default, no.  What I've done is drag folders I access frequently to the Places section in the left side bar.  There is software to accomplish this though.  Default Folder X does this, and more.
If you're in a save dialogue you can press / to get a file path dialogue, or press ⌘+Shift+G to get a "Go to folder" dialogue.

A: Not a shortcut, but you can drag finder proxy icons (in the titlebar), folders and even files into open/save dialogues to jump to the folder (if you drag a file, the file name field will be prefilled with its file name).
