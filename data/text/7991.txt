Q: How can I convert a .eml file to a .mbox file for Apple Mail? How can I convert a Windows Live Mail eml file to Apple Mail mbox file

A: Assuming you have access to the PC with windows live mail.


*

*Install thunderbird on the PC. This will allow you to import windows live mail, outlook express
mails etc. 

*Create a gmail account, with IMAP enabled. Upload your imported email from thunderbird to gmail. This should be as simple as dragging the mail over.

*Point your Mail.app at gmail and download your mail. 

A: There is a shell script and also a ruby script here - http://tinyapps.org/blog/misc/201110180700_eml2mbx.html
Ruby script did not work for me but shell script worked nicely. Both are free options. 

A: Here is one solution I found... Here is another, and another. I thought there was a free solution, but I cannot find it.. Hope these help. I will keep looking..

A: Klammer will open Outlook .msg files, standard .eml files, and also winmail.dat files on your iPad. We purchased the app and took it for a spin on our iPad, testing its ability to open both eml and Outlook msg files. 
It will be found at apple store.
