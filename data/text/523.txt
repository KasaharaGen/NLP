Q: Twitter for iPhone dead after update I updated Twitter for iPhone on my second generation iPod Touch running iphone OS 3.1.2. After the update, the icon was nowhere to be seen, and I had to restart my iPod to get it back. Attempting to launch the app would get a White screen for a few seconds, and then a crash. 
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and I've had no luck. How can I get the app working again?

A: Twitter announced that the Twitter app is broken on 3.x.x and that a update fixing it is on its way. There's no way you can manually fix it; you just have to wait for the update. Usually a crashing issue is due to low RAM (which is fixed with a restart / reinstall) but this one is a firmware issue.
