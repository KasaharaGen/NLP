Q: Automator or AppleScript Rename Workflow Is it possible to automate the following action:
Example
Folder name: "TEST" the name of the file inside the folder is: "Evelyn.jpg".
How do I rename the folder using the name of the file inside of it:
Result
Folder name: "EVELYN" the name of the file inside the folder is: "Evelyn.jpg".
Any ideas how to achieve this with Automator or AppleScript?

A: Here's a script:
set thefolder to "path:to:folder" as alias
tell application "Finder"
    set filename to name of first item of folder thefolder
    set oldDels to AppleScript's text item delimiters as string
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "." as string
    set itemname to first text item of filename
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDels as string
    set name of thefolder to itemname
end tell

It gets the name of the first item in the folder, clips off the extension, and renames the folder.
Note that it doesn't convert to uppercase as in your example. This is less than trivial with AppleScript, but let me know if it's real important and I can give you the code.

A: Here is an Automator Workflow that will do it for you.
