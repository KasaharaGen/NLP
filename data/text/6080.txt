Q: How can I make ⌘H send an app to the back of the ⌘Tab stack on Lion?

Can I get back Snow-Leopard-like application hiding (Cmd-H) in Lion? 

I just upgraded from Tiger (on an old MacBook) to Lion on a new MacBook Air. I had become accustomed to using ⌘H to both hide an application and to put it to the back of the ⌘Tab order.
On Lion, the ⌘H command still hides the window but doesn't change the position of the application in the ⌘Tab order. Pressing ⌘H then ⌘Tab brings the application right back to the foreground. By hiding the app, I want to say that I'm not interested in using it for now.
Is there another keystroke that sends an application back to the bottom of the ⌘Tab stack? Or is there a way to change the behaviour of ⌘H to hide and send to the back of the stack?
