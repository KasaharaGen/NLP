Q: How can I change Finder's default sort to filename? Since I updated to Lion, every time I bring up a new Finder window the default sort order is by modification date. I want the default sort by filename. Is there any way to change this?

A: Open the finder window and hit cmd+j.
Select the settings you want and then at the bottom hit Use As Defaults.
