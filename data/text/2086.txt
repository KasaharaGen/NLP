Q: Triple finger tap for middle click? I can single tap my trackpad for a left click, and tap it with two fingers for a right click. Is there any way to bind a three finger tap to perform a middle click?
I tried MagicPrefs, but it's limited to the MagicMouse only, it doesn't work with the trackpad.

A: You can try BetterTouchTool. There might be a setting to do that. Maybe you'll even find another gesture to triple-click that you'll like better.

A: There is also another tool that I like more then BetterTouchTool,
it's called MiddleClick and does exactly what you expect :-)
