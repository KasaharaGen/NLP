Q: Jailbroken iPhone dead; What firmware "load" options do I have? I jailbroke my original iPhone first gen to version 3.14 (I think) and since then I'm unable to use the phone. 
I've done this before and never once had an issue (so I'm semi-experienced with this).
Symptoms


*

*iTunes says the phone is in recovery mode.  





*

*The screen looks like a newly loaded (not activated phone)



Attempts to fix


*

*I've loaded almost every original (not jailbroken) ipsw from 3.0 to the latest one (for this model) and am not able to get back to defaults. I get the following error:


*I've loaded many different Jailbreak programs and none of them can make the phone work.
I'm OK if I don't ever get cellular service and just use it as an iPod Touch.  Anyone know how I can get past this screen in either jailbroken or original mode?

A: From every piece of literature I can find on the topic, and my own past experience, this normally indicates a hardware failure. Your best bet would be to take it to your nearest Apple store and they might be able to assist.

A: if I remember well, since 3.1.3 you can't reinstall firmware on jailbreaked phones with itunes. I had the same problem and 3.1.2 restore worked without problem.
needed for iphone 2g:
BL-39.bin and BL-46.bin boot loaders files
resdn0w-win_0.9.4 - to jailbreak - other versions were not working with the restore file below
iPhone1,1_3.1.2_7D11_Restore.ipsw - restore file worked with itunes 10
I'm sure you can find these files easily for download.
