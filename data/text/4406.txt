Q: Synchronizing iPhone and Mail.app inboxes I have IMAP configured on both my iPhone 3G and MacBook and I have push enabled on my iPhone.
When I receive an email and read it on my MacBook, shouldn't it mark it as unread on the iPhone too? 
I didn't really notice it before, but recently, it has been annoying me that once I have viewed them on my MacBook I have to view them on my iPhone to mark then as read.
Just checking for new mail in the iPhone doesn't suffice.
Is there a way to make sure the changes on the Mail.app inbox are applied immediately to the iPhone?
I have my own email servers on my own domain(maquib.com hosted on dreamhost). My brother who also has an account and configured the same way has also noticed this.
Here are some screenshots of how my iPhone and Mac are configured:



A: I don't think it's an iPhone configuration problem.
Maybe a Mail.app problem, it seems it's no syncing back the changes correctly. Except I don't think there's a preference to change that.
It's most likely a server configuration problem.
To be sure, we'll need more information about your mail servers. Do you have access to the configuration? What is maquib.com? From the look of it, it looks like your personal server (with a project to make a Mac OS Tiger app!)

Can you try to download Sparrow? (there's a free version)
Add your account on it and see if the problem is still there. That way we'll know if the problem is on the server or on the software side.
