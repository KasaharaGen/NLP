Q: How can I open files in the Coda editor file browser using the keyboard? I am using coda as my main editor on mac. But I want to use just the keyboard for navigating through file browser. This I was able to quite easily by installing the plugin to switch between editor and file browser and then turning off the feature which opens files on a single-click or when it is focussed.
Now my problem is how to open a file in editor when I press enter - the file rename mode gets activated when I press enter while navigating in file browser. any ideas?

A: Both return and command + O work to open files in my version of coda.
Is your enter key only an enter key or combined?
It doesn't look like that plug in changes key bindings so you might have to search elsewhere for something that is altering the standard behavior. Other tweaks or software possibly? 

A: Press ⌘ Command ↓ to open a file you have selected.
