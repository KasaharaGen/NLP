Q: How can I remove Firefox using terminal? I'm a beginner with Mac OS X. Would somebody please tell me how to fully uninstall Firefox using Terminal on Mac OS X Lion?
I'm experiencing hangs and crashes with Firefox 5.0.1, so I want to remove it then re-install it.
Thanks so much in advance.

A: To remove Firefox.app:


*

*Login with an administrator account

*sudo rm -rf /Applications/Firefox.app/
You get the same result by just dragging the Firefox app from /Applications/ to the trash. 
If the crashes continue after reinstalling, deleting preferences and support files in the user library may help:


*

*~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox*

*~/Library/Application Support/Firefox

*~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla

*~/Library/Mozilla

*~/Library/Caches/Firefox

A: It's very probable that your profile is corrupt, rather than Firefox itself (in which case, deleting Firefox won't help as any new installation will use the corrupt profile). 
Creating a new profile may help - the safest way to do that is using the Profile Manager.

A: You might also consider uninstalling it using AppZapper, which will remove the app and all of its configuration files.  There is a fully-functional free trial available.
