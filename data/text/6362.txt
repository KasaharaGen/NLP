Q: Apple SSD TSC 128 GB on Windows desktop My MacBook Pro 2011 is having problems. When I turn it on, I hear the chime but the screen is black. I am planning to send it off to Apple since I have AppleCare. But before I do that, I need to backup my hard drive. I have taken the hard drive out and plugged it into my desktop, but I don't see it. I see it in device manager - > Apple TSC 128 GB, but how can I browse through the contents and save the stuff? Thanks.

A: Your MBP uses the HFS+ files system which Windows cannot natively read. You will need something like HFS+ for windows or MacDrive to get it to work. Catacobae looks to be free and people like it on SourceForge.
