Q: Is it possible to downgrade modemfirmware? I've updated the iOS on my iPhone 4 to 5.0.1 the baseband was also updated to 04.11.08. I've downgraded the OS it but the baseband didn't change, can someone help please?

A: In general, it's not possible to downgrade the modem firmware / baseband software version on iOS, even if you jailbreak the device or use software designed to install modified software on an iPhone. 
It's a popular request, so I imagine many people are working on it but nothing is out today to perform the task you ask on the iPhone 4.
