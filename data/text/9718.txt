Q: How do I get my videos off my iPad 2? I put a bunch of videos onto my iPad 2 a while ago, syncing them over iTunes. The PC that I set this up on is no longer available. All I have now is my iPad with the videos, and a new computer with a clean install of iTunes.
Now it seems that iTunes wants to wipe all those videos off the iPad in order to set up a sync.
Can I get these videos off the iPad somehow?
(connecting the iPad as a camera doesn't help: this only shows videos shot using the iPad camera, but not the videos I recorded with my camcorder and synced over iTunes)

A: Have you looked into software like TouchCopy to transfer the videos? It offers a Windows and Mac version. I prefer PhoneView to this software on a Mac, but you have tagged this windows so TouchCopy seems a better fit.
