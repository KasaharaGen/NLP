Q: Espresso Libre theme for MacVim? I recently changed editors from TextMate to MacVim. Thanks in part to vimtutor, things are going pretty well. But I miss the Espresso Libre color scheme:

Is there a place where I can get Espresso Libre as a MacVim theme?

A: If you have the TextMate theme file, you can use this online converter to spit out a (Mac)Vim theme file for you: http://coloration.sickill.net/
It should do a pretty good job of converting it for you, as it did for the ones I've tried.

A: You'll probably be able to find something quite similar if not identical using vimcolorschemetest
