Q: UK MBA keyboard layout vs Apple external keyboard layouts This question is not about remapping keyboard layouts and different languages. This is about the actual differences in the physical location of keys.
My June 2011 UK Macbook Air has the same keyboard layout I'm used to from previous Macbooks - a double height return key and the backtick/tilde key inbetween left-shift and Z.
I recently got to Australia and bought an external keyboard in the Apple store, not realising the physical layout would be different. The keyboard looks like this:

I want to get an external keyboard which matches my Macbook Air - which I guess would be the external wireless keyboard. Unfortunately, even the Apple Store suggests the layout of the "British" one is not what I'm expecting:

Can anyone explain if/when the keyboards changed? Is is possible for me to get an external keyboard with the same layout as my MBA?
Thanks y'all

A: Regarding the extra key to the left of the z, you should get that with any "ISO" keyboard sold in Europe.  In the US, keyboards are "ANSI" and are missing that key.  Other countries may vary.  See this note:

A: The pictures in the Apple Store are just wrong. The picture below is of a US keyboard layout (or a layout similar to it), not the British one that's actually being sold:

The British layout should look like this:
