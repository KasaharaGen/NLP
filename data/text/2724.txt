Q: Uninstall VMWare Fusion and VMWare Tools on boot camp partition I was using VMWare Fusion on a boot camp partition and installed VMWare Tools on the Windows volume.
How can I completely uninstall everything related to VMWare Fusion?

A: *

*Uninstall the VMWare Tools in the VM using the uninstaller in Add/Remove Programs

*Use the Fusion uninstaller on the installation DMG to remove VMWare Fusion

*Follow this VMware KB article to clean up Fusion completely.


Sidenote: I can't find an official KB article for removing the tools, and those I do find all only mention Add/Remove. I am assuming it does a complete removal.

A: *

*Uninstall VMWare Fusion: (source)

*

*Quit VMWare Fusion, making sure that the VM is not running.

*Run the uninstaller that came in the original .dmg file.

*Launch the uninstaller.


*Restart the machine and boot into the Windows partition.

*Uninstall VMWare Tools normally via Add/Remove programs (source).
