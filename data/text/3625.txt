Q: mouse move wakes up sleeping mac.. how to prevent? When the cleaning man has been by my desk then my computer wakes up from sleep. How can I make it insensitive to mouse movements?

A: If it is a bluetooth mouse you can disable it waking the computer by unchecking 
Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer.

in System Preferences - Bluetooth - Advanced
This will also effect the wireless keyboard waking the Mac so you will need to use the power button to wake it.
