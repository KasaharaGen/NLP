Q: How do I split a Bootcamp Partition on a second drive? I have a Mac Mini Server 2011, which has 2 Hard disks of 750GB  each.
I want to install Windows 7 on the second disk, but i want to split this disk on two partitions: One of 450 GB for Windows and one of 300 GB with exFat to share data between Windows and OS X (is Lion by the way). 
I tried with the Bootcamp assistant, but it took for the Bootcamp partition the whole disk, and so I installed that way, but I prefer to have both partitions as I mentioned above.
Can I split it the way I want? I don't mind if I have to reinstall Windows as long as I have the best compatible solution for this.

A: Open Disk Utility and format second HDD with Partition Map Scheme to be Master Boot Record.
Then start up from Windows Install Disk by pressing Alt or C and create partitions from there.
You should probably use Bootcamp Assistant before (or after) just to save Windows drivers and Bootcamp taskbar utility to the flash disk or elsewhere.

A: Should work without problems, but didn't try: Open Disk Utility. Create two partitions, an exFAT-partition and a mac-partition. Then, start bootcamp assistant and use the mac partition to install windows.
