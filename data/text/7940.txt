Q: Which one is faster? iMac 27 with Quad Core i5 2.7GHz or a Macbook Pro 15 with Quad Core i7 2GHz? They are about the same price ($100 difference, iMac $1699, Macbook Pro $1799), and
iMac: Quad Core i5 2.7GHz
Macbook Pro: Quad Core i7 2.0GHz
How can you tell which processor is faster?
(the iMac shows 4 processors in the Activity Monitor, while the Macbook Pro shows 8 processors)

A: They are the same, or the i5 would be infinitesimally faster, which would translate into no real world difference (certainly none above perceptual thresholds).
This article compared the i5 750 (2.66 GHz clockspeed) vs. the i7 860 (2.8 GHz clockspeed). Data shows the i7 inched ahead by an average of a 3% performance improvement on the whole. Make note that this is a lopsided comparison in favour of the i7 (if only marginally). The Macs you list would favour the heavier clockspeed on the i5. The i7 has hyperthreading (hence seeing the 8 cores) but that doesn't do enough to give it a substantial lead.
The article also shows the i5 outperforming the i7 in power consumption, which should be a deciding factor when buying a notebook.
But at the end of the day, you are comparing a notebook with a desktop, so it's a little lopsided. The iMac has a much better video card and a larger screen with a higher resolution. There is much more to a system than the CPU. On a whole, the iMac is a faster (better) machine, but not portable.

A: Faster is not objective category since it always should be asked faster for what?
Geekbench in 64bit mode gives ~ 8600 for Intel Core i5-2500S 2.7 GHz (4 cores) and ~9500 for Intel Core i7-2635QM 2.0 GHz (4 cores)
by this numbers alone we should say Macbook Pro is faster, right?
But Geekbench only take processor, cache and RAM speed into account.
What does it mean is for example encoding video in well threaded application (let's use Handbrake's h.264 engine as an example) MBP will finish around 10% faster if we abstract from i/o speed (hdd or odd)
But in a case of not so well threaded application (Adobe Photoshop for ex.) iMac's faster clock will probably gives better results.
And since iMac's HDD is a bit faster than MBP's one this will also add to a difference.
