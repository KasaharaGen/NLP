Q: How to save an iTunes Podcast to a USB stick? I have downloaded WWDC 2010 podcast from iTunes. How can I find the Podcast file and save it to a USB Memory stick so people who doesn't have iTunes can play it using quicktime?

A: 
Right-Click on the file in iTunes, then select "Show in Finder"

There you have your Podcast-File. You can copy it on your USB-Drive or wherever you want!

A: You can:


*

*Go into podcasts in iTunes.

*Select "Show Feed" at the bottom if you haven't already to show episodes not yet downloaded

*Click the Cloud Icon With Down Arrow next to the episode you want to download

*Open USB Stick in Finder

*Drag and drop the downloaded episode from iTunes to USB folder (no need to find the file, this creates a copy on USB stick)
