Q: Can I use the same Lion OS X license on a home and a work machine, or do I have to buy one for each? I bought a Lion OS X license for my home Mac. Can I use this same license to install Lion on my work computer?
The Can I use the new Lion OS X license on two machines, or do I have to buy one for each? question is similar, but that question is about installing on two home machines. My doubt is caused by this excerpt from the App Store license (emphasis mine):

(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial use [...]

If the moderators feel it's more appropriate to complement that question instead of opening a new one, please say so.

A: Since you purchase it from the Mac app store the licensing is the same as other Mac App store purchases. I can't find the exact resource but I believe you can install it on up to 5 Macs.
Here is an article with some information about licensing in Lion. http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/07/single-purchase-of-lion-installs-on-all-macs/
Update: I found some clear language from Apple's Lion press release

The Lion upgrade can be installed on all your authorized personal Macs


A: I believe if you want to follow the letter of the EULA you will need to buy it twice.
With respect to installing a single purchase of Lion on multiple machines, your options are: all the machines you personally own or all the machines that your employer owns and you exclusively use.[1] 
From the Lion EULA:


*

*install for personal, non-commercial use... on each Apple-branded computer...that you own or control;â€¨

*If you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution, to download, install, use, and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software for use either: (a) by a single individual on each of the Mac Computer(s) that you own or control


Basically all machines that are your property you can install it on.  If you'd take your work computer home if you got fired then you only need one license, otherwise two.
[1] - there is also some provision for machines used by multiple people.

A: Please refer my answer here for your question: 

Can I use the new Lion OS X license on two machines, or do I have to buy one for each?
