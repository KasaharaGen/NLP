Q: good dictionary which support text to speech or real voice pronunciation? I have just switch to a mac recently. Trying to find some thing equivalent to Babylon on windows but haven't found any. 
I wonder if are there any good dictionary software which support real voice pronunciation or at least text-to-speech? Other functions like one-click translation is also necessary.

A: OSX has a built in speech synthesizer which is quite good if you're looking for English pronunciation.
You can open up the terminal and enter the following command:
say "Hello! How are you?"

For dictionary I use the Dictionary application which is shipped with your OS as well. You can import multiple dictionary files into it. Here is a tutorial to do that.
The best part is that you can type âŒ˜ + ctrl + d to bring up the inline dictionary in cocoa applications. It's really handy.
