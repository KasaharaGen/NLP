Q: iPhone: play podcasts via voice command? Is there a way to get the iPhone 3gs to play a Podcast via voice command?
I've tried all sorts of things and it doesn't seem to work. I believe the official answer is no, but I was wondering if there was a Cydia or other app that can achieve the same result?

A: The official answer is No.
As of iOS 4, there is a simple workaround, however. You can just add a podcast to a playlist and speak "Play playlist PlaylistName".
