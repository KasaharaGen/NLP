Q: How can I swap the shift key with another key? I'd like to swap the shift key with the / key. Ukelele says that it can't be used to change modifier keys. DoubleCommand has static settings that you can either enable or disable. It doesn't let you chose your own custom bindings, and needless to say, this remapping I want isn't available.

A: You can swap shift key with some other with key using  KeyRemao4Macbook but I am not sure can swap with / .


A: PCKeyboardHack will do that.
