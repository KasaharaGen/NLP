Q: Converting HTML to PDF using convert utility in Mac OS X I'm trying to convert a bunch of HTML files into PDF files. I'm looking for an automated solution so that i don't have to open each HTML file individually and convert it to PDF. In Mac OSX, convert utility can be used to convert HTML files to PDF. I'm facing two problems. 


*

*convert utility is not applying CSS style to generated PDF content.

*My AppleScript for batch convert is not working.


Here's my AppleScript:
on open input_documents
    repeat with this_document in input_documents

        if this_document is not document file then
            set this_document_path to POSIX path of this_document
            do shell script "/System/Library/Printers/Libraries/convert -f " & quoted form of this_document_path & " -o " & quoted form of this_document_path & ".pdf"
        end if
    end repeat
end open

I use this script to create a .app and then drag the documents folder onto the generated .app file. Note that all images associated with images are placed in a subdirectory/subfolder. My document structure looks like this:
/HTML
/HTML/Images/
/HTML/a.html
/HTML/b.html

Any suggestions?

A: Have a look at wkhtmltopdfâ€” a command-line utility that uses the WebKit rendering engine to produce PDFs from HTML. I've found that it produces a nicer result. You shouldn't have any trouble integrating it with your current script.

A: Have you considered writing an AppleScript script to open each HTML file in a scriptable web browser (like Safari) and then using the browser's standard print command to print to a PDF file?
