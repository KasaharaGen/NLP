Can I upgrade my 2008 Mac Pro completely? 

I have a 2nd Gen 2008 Mac Pro 2.8ghz Quad Core with an 8800GT. I'm sure I can get away with the processing power and more RAM for now.
Is there any way possible I can put a modern day GPU inside this machine?
What does it entail to do such customizations? 
Could I gut this machine and upgrade it fully to current technology?
Thanks.

A: You should be good to upgrade to a modern GPU (PCI-X). Keep in mind that you will need to purchase an 'Apple' version of any graphics card you upgrade to.
