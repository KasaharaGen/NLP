Q: How do I set a persistent background image for a USB drive? I'm trying to change the folder background image on a USB flash drive, using the View Options panel. However, when I eject and re-insert the drive, these settings (as well as icon positions, etc.) aren't saved. In fact it doesn't look like Finder is even creating a .DS_Store file. How can I make this work?
