Q: Can't find coda plist I can't seem to find my Coda plist. I've searched all throughout my library (including the Preferences folder), and I can't seem to find it. I've searched my computer, and that doesn't work either... Can anyone else find their coda plist?

A: Coda's preference plist file is stored here:
~/Library/Preferences/com.panic.Coda.plist

There's also ~/Library/Preferences/com.panic.Coda.LSSharedFileList.plist. I'm not sure what this does exactly, but it doesn't appear to store preferences.

A: I found it in my system using FileZilla :-) which shows hidden files.
