Q: Emoji in Keynote I cannot insert emojis in a keynote presentation. More precisely, when I insert one (Edit > Special characters), I have a blank space instead of the emoji.
This works very fine with textedit.
Does anyone successfully did that?
(Lion 10.7.1 and Keynote'09 5.1)

A: I think iWork has not yet been updated to support the Apple Color Emoji font.
The vast majority of the special characters that are monochrome work fine - you might try the old way of specifying a font directly - Symbola has emoticons that might work until Keynote gets updated. 

A: Emoticons and other symbols work for me as only when I am typing inside a text box.
I tried dragging them to keynote but nothing happened.
But when I 'called' them using the Edit... menu that you found they were inserted in my text.
I was able to resize, move...
