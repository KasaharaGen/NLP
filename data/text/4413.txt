Q: Macbook 5,2 Black Screen Issue Macbook screen goes black a few seconds after been woken or started up. I've tried everything outside of opening it up or bringing it back to the hive.
Has anyone else run into this issue, or am I a lonely sailor sailing up a creek of sticky brown paste that's not chocolate?
It's a Macbook 5,2 (early 2009, 10.5).

A: A couple of things to try would be:
Reset the PRAM

*

*Restart your Mac


*As soon as you press the power button to turn it back on, hold the
⌘ +  ⌥ + P + R keys until you hear the startup chime twice
Reset the SMC

*

*Shut down your Mac


*Remove the battery and unplug the power cable


*Hold down the power button for 10 seconds and then let go


*Restart your Mac normally
These steps may not resolve your issue, but it's worth a shot. If they do no resolve the issue, it is likely related to the inverter board, which sends power to your display backlight. It's relatively common in this model MacBook.
It shouldn't be to expensive to repair, but I would not recommend doing it yourself. It's taken me hours to do that repair, and that's in an Apple Store with all the right tools, Apple Technician Guides and the proper training.

A: It's probably broken (usually by heat).
My friend got similar problem and the service changed his graphics "card" in the notebook. He played a lot WoW on his notebook and sometimes got it really extremely hot.
