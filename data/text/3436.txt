Q: Is there a way to display more metadata fields in the Finder list view? If I view and sort files in a directory using Finder's list view I seem to be limited to a rather anaemic:


*

*Name

*Date Modified

*Size

*Kind


Now, take an .mp3 file for example. There is potentially a lot of metadata associated with that file, and this may be a useful basis to sort by.
Is there a way to make available more fields to sort by? Or do I need to resort to a Finder replacement? I realize that iTunes could do most, but not all, of what I want. (iTunes doesn't display some .mp3 metadata fields.)

A: I'm pretty sure you're (sadly) limited to the fields in the view options windows (cmd+j).
