Q: Import Google Voice Contacts Into iPhone What I'd like to do is have my Google Voice contacts available on my iPhone, not the other way around.  I recently had to restore the phone to factory defaults and it's a pain to manually enter all them all.
When I make a new GMail e-mail account on my iPhone it won't let me import contacts from my Google account, but even if it did I don't want every single contact in my phone.  Google for some reason adds every single person I've ever sent e-mails to into my contacts list, which as you can imagine is quite a large list by now.
Does anyone have any suggestions for how to do this?

A: *

*Go to the Contacts tab of the GV sidebar. 

*Click the Export link at the top right. 

*Select which you want to export. 

*Use the Outlook CSV format if you've got a PC and the vCard format if you've got a Mac. 

*Import it to Outlook or Address book (depending on your system) and set iTunes to sync contacts to the iPhone from that program.


A: You can trim the contacts you have and setup google sync via exchange and it should only sync your contacts from "My Contacts"

A: Set up your iPhone with the Exchange Servers that Google has. I have mine set up for just Calendar and Contacts sync. For instructions, take a look over here. Also, take a look over at the Google Voice iPhone app - it's fairly useful, and it can (and indeed has for my dad at least) replaced Messages.App and Phone.App on his iPhone.
