Q: How can I rip my DVD to play them on my TV? I would like to rip a DVD on to Mac then onto a multimedia device to play them on my TV set.
Is there a software that will help me to do so?

A: I absolutely agree that Handbrake is a great tool to use.
However, I got Ripit in one of the Mac software bundles, and it's a great program too, especially if you want something that will:


*

*automatically start running as soon as you insert a DVD (and eject when it's done, if you want)

*not only rip the DVD but also pull out individual episodes from a DVD of a TV show, etc.
Generally I use RipIt to make VIDEO_TS folders out of DVDs and then use Handbrake to convert the Video_TS files into video files. The nice thing about that setup is that I can rip a bunch of DVDs, and then set the Handbrake queue to process the VIDEO_TS files, and just leave the computer to run unattended until it has finished.
RipIt is $25, which will be a deal-breaker for some, especially when HandBrake is free, but if you've purchased Mac bundles in the past, you might already have a license code for it.

A: You can use HandBrake. 

HandBrake is an open-source, GPL-licensed, multiplatform, multithreaded video transcoder, available for MacOS X, Linux and Windows.

There are a lot of built-in preset  you can chose from to rip your DVD to a format you'll be able to play on your multimedia device.

A: I use ripIt mainly because it's so easy to use (I also tried handbrake). it cost 25$ but you can rip 10 DVDs for free to try it...

A: Just use itunes movies and burn to disk... DVD-R's are pretty cheap, then just convert it on videora (free) or if you have a ps3, just stick it on a USB stick

A: My vote goes to Handbrake for ripping, but you could also use Disk Utility to simply make an ISO of the DVD.
