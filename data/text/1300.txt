Q: Reply button not working I have a MacBook Pro, which uses Safari as the web browser.
When I check my company's e-mail online, I cannot use the Reply button (it simply does not respond.)
I wonder what I should do to fix this problem. (My computer is new.)

A: Does anything else not work, or is it just the “Reply” button? A few things you could try:


*

*Restart Safari—or your computer. Sounds dumb, but it's amazing how often this does the trick.

*Use the menu item “Safari -> Empty Cache…” to clear Safari’s cache.

*Try to use your company’s webmail in another browser. There may be a subtle bug (or feature?) in the website’s code that Safari is not handling properly. Here are a few alternatives:

*

*Mozilla Firefox

*Google Chrome

*Opera

*OmniWeb

*Camino

*Internet Explorer, on Windows, just to check. Even in this day and age, some websites still only work properly with IE.

*Netscape Navigator (Yuk yuk yuk. Just kidding, don’t download this. For the love of God, don’t download this.)



A: Ok. I figured out. It is that the Block Pop-up Window that was checked.
