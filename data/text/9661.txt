Q: Ubuntu Disk isn't showing up at Boot I recently installed ubuntu on a flash drive, following all of the instructions on the ubuntu website.
When I started up my mac, it didn't appear in the boot menu. Has this happened to anyone else here booting their thumb drives onto their macs? If so, what did you do to fix this?
(I asked this on the Ubuntu forums as well, but I thought that it would be relevant here as well)

A: hold option at the sound of the chime.
