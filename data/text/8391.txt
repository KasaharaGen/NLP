Q: Can you copy files to /Applications using Launchbar? For lot of applications, the disc image (.dmg) contains the .app files which needs to be copied to the /Applications folder. 
I use Launchbar's Instant Send feature to open the selected files quickly in some text editor. Is there a way I can use this feature to quickly send a selected application to /Applications?

A: Once you use the Instant Send hotkey to select the file in Launchbar...

You can start typing "Applications" to select your /Applications folder.

Then press Return and select Copy to "Applications" from the menu.
