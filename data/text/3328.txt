Q: iPad VNC client: Edovia Screens: Does it support multiple displays? Does Edovia "Screens" support multiple displays?  My Mac has two displays, and I need to be able access applications that open on either one of them.  

A: Screens does let you select a specific display on the fly when you connect to Mac. This is a feature built in Screen Sharing, which is Apple's VNC protocol.
If you're connecting to a PC, you can use ports 5901...590x to specific the display to use before connecting.

A: In short: Screens supports multiple monitors but they'll appear as one wide display.
