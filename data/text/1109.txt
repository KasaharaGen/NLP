Q: iPhone: How to prevent maximum screen brightness when charging? I've set my screen brightness to about 50%. This works fine for me, except that the setting seems to be ignored when it's charging: then it's 100%. I've got a desktop charging stand on my bedside table, and this is exactly the place where I don't need maximum brightness!
How can I make my iPhone respect the brightness setting even when charging?
This is an iPhone 4 (iOS 4.1) but I noticed the same with the iPhone 3G (iOS 3.1.3). 

A: Upgrade to iOS 4.2. It fixes both the charging brightness and the locked screen brightness bugs. I just tried it and it works. 

A: I can't seem to reproduce this issue. Is it possible that ambient light is increasing the brightness? Does it still go to 100% brightness if you turn off Auto-Brightness?

A: Can't fix it -- currently.
Based on postings so far, this is a bug in iOS 4.1 (less prominent/problematic in 3.x versions). 
The only solution would be to upgrade to a newer version when that becomes available if this bug has been fixed in that version.
