Q: Can the macbook air trackpad play nice with the iOS simulator? Does anyone knows if (and how) I can get my MacBook Air trackpad to feel more natural when used with the iOS simulator ?
It should be easier to use the iOS simulator with the trackpad - but it's not, it's way more difficult to scroll :-( It feels weird but it's the only time I wish I had a mouse on my mac book air - to emulate a touch screen :-|

A: Unfortunatly the simulator was not built to understand multi-touch gestures which is strange considering the rest of the OS has. I think you will just need to wait until Apple updates the simulator.

A: This might help, I posted this elsewhere:
Enable 3 finger drag: 


*

*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.

*Click the Accessibility icon

*Choose Mouse & Trackpad from the options on the left

*Click Trackpad Options

*Place a checkmark next to "Enable dragging" 

*From the related pop-up menu, choose “three finger drag” so there's a checkmark next to it

*Click OK

A: Have a look at the iOS Simulator Plus utility I wrote. It's not really a 100% solution but I think it is one step more convenient.
