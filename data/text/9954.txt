Q: iPhone 4S stereo sound

iPhone 4 - sound only comes out of one speaker 

I finally got my iPhone 4S! But when playing a song, I noticed the sound isn't stereo. The right box is doing all the hard box, while the left one is producing a very minimal sound. Is this standard on the iPhone 4S or is it a hardware/software issue?

A: This is expected - the iPhone 4S does not have stereo speakers. The left "box" is actually a microphone:
