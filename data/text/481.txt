Q: Is there a backquote on the iPhone keyboard? Is there a backquote (backtick `) on the iPhone keyboard, and if so, where is it?
When I'm writing a post on a site in the SE family (especially SO), I want to use the backquote for inline code blocks. Under the single quote key, I've found two curly/angled quotes, but those (’ and ‘) don't seem to do the trick...

A: The backtick/backquote was added to the iOS keyboard in 4.1. You need to switch to the numbers keypad and then press & hold apostrophe to access it. Once the variations show up - slide your finger without removing it from the screen. Remove your finger when it's over the correct ` key.

A: It seems like you have to resort to a hack to use the character:


*

*Go to an email address field (e.g. open up Mail and compose a new message).

*Go to the symbols keyboard (3rd one).

*Type the ` character located on the top left.

*Copy and paste the character wherever you want.


A: go into settings > general > keyboards > text replacement and add it with a phrase into your phone copying the backtick symbol to your clipboard and pasting in the shortcut.
ie: i put for phrase:  "' (quotation symbol apostrophe)
and shortcut: ```(3 backticks)
because in the english language thats not a thing that would really be typed in conjunction.
