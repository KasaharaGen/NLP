Q: How can I drag and drop email attachments in Mail on Lion? I use Mail.app on Lion with Classic View enabled so it works like it did in Snow Leopard.
When an email comes in with an attachment, I used to be able to select one or more attachments and drag them to my desktop.  In Lion, it looks like I have to click "Save" and then choose a location for the file.
How can I drag and drop email attachments in Lion?  
If the answer is I can't, then can someone explain why the change?  Having to click the "save" drop down, click an attachment, choose a directory in the pop-up, and then click the "save" button is much more work than drag-and-drop (and it feels decidedly Windows-esq, frankly).

A: I had a similar problem when doing a complete hard drive erase and reinstalling Lion and all other software including Mail. 
When Mail was launched for the first time I was unable to drag and drop attachments anywhere - Finder nor desktop.
Usually at the top of an email with attachments there are buttons with save options. This button was not visible. 
Above where buttons usually appear there are two hyperlinked text options.
If you click the 'details' link, buttons re-appear.
For some reason this was stopping the drag and drop option from working - now it works fine.
