Q: Whats the last OS X that supported Power PC? I still have an old Power PC machine and was wondering what the latest OS X build I can install on it?

A: 
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) is also the
  first Mac OS release since the
  introduction of System 7.1.2 that
  does not support the PowerPC
  architecture, as Apple now intends to
  focus on its current line of
  Intel-based products.

Thus OS X supported PowerPC up to and including version 10.5 (Leopard).

A: 10.5 Leopard is the last to support PowerPC as far as I know:

A: Snow leopard does support PowerPC applications, this function was dropped with Lion. I base this on one MacBook with Snow Leopard on it works fine with Microsoft Office X, Quake II (OS XVersion), Halo, Roxio Toast Lite 5.2.2. 
However on my upgrade MacBook running Lion they are tomb stoned and when you try to run them the message you receive is PowerPcC no longer supported!
