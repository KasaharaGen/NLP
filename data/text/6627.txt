Q: Lion seems to have made both Safari and Chrome pause when opening more tabs I recently upgraded to Lion and am mostly very pleased. However I'm having some errant behaviour when CMD clicking on links in Safari and Chrome. Instead of opening the page in a new tab, often nothing happens until I do the same again, at which point two tabs open to the target page.
This doesn't happen every time, but now it's happening more often than not.
I'm using a late 2008 Unibody MacBook with the glass trackpad.
Since both Safari and Chrome pause when opening more tabs, I'm a bit at a loss where to look next for a cause or solution.
