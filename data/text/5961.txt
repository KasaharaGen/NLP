Q: How to reload autofs on Lion without restarting? I'm trying to get my host machine running Lion to automount an NFS export on my CentOS VM.
I was able to get this working on a system running Mac OS 10.5 by modifying /etc/auto_master and then restarting the autofs service per the instructions in http://alanlam.blogspot.com/2008/06/restart-autofs-in-leopard-without.html:


sudo service com.apple.autofsd stop
sudo service com.apple.autofsd start


However, in Lion, the service command appears to be missing.
How do I reload the autofs service in OS X Lion without restarting?

A: You can use launchctl instead of service:
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.autofsd

You should not need to restart autofsdt manually; launchd will notice that it has stopped, and immediately start another instance.

A: this works for me:
sudo automount -vc
