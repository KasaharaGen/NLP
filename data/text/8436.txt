Q: Is the iOS5 GM identical to the final version? Are there any differences between the iOS 5 GM seed released to developers and the final version released to the public? If I have the GM installed, do I need to do anything?

A: No changes in file bytesize at least.  The first GM seed for 10.7.2 was initially marginally different to the final version in some way and was updated, but the iOS 5 release is identical.  No need to change anything.  If you were not already on the GM/release version, it would have complained by today and deactivated your phone...
