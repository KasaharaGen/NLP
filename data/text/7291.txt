Q: Emoticon keyboard on iphone, not emoji How to have a keyboard that presents shortcuts for common ascii emoticons?
I specifically do NOT want anything that uses the emoji unicode symbols. But instead a keyboard that provides shortcuts for the standard emoticons such as :-), :-(, ;-), B-), :-*, <3, and so on.
Update: so far, it seems there is no way to do what I ask for. So I asked a more specific question asking for SMS apps that support ASCII emoticons.

A: As Apple doesn't allow for third-party keyboards outside of apps, you'd have to find (or make) an app that does what you want and design your own keyboard to do that.

A: You can set up shortcuts under Settings → General → Keyboards → Shortcuts.
For example you could set up a shortcut as follows:
phrase = :-]
shortcut = sml

A: If you add Japanese Kana or Chinese simplified keyboards there is a smiley face button with a bunch of ascii art smiley faces, but they're not exactly the "standard emoticons" that you refer to.
Eg.
