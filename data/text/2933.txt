Q: Unable to install from downloaded disk image file My Mac G4 (running OS X 10.3.9) won't install from any .dmg file I download. It keeps popping up a message: "name of setup & no mountable file system" or "application file cannot be found". Is there some setting I need to change to get around this problem as I need to install some extra programs urgently.

A: It is likely the disk images do not support Mac OS X 10.3.9.
The command line tool used to create disk images is called hdiutil. This hdiutil manual page documents the DMG format's history and compatibility with older editions of Mac OS X.

A: I think a lot of the DMGs that you find on the internets today are compressed, which older disk utilities may not support. You might be SOL here  =\ (unless you upgrade or has another computer with a newer OS)
