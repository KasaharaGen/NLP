Q: iPad app for reading and writing guitar tablature I'm looking for an iPad app for guitar tabs reading and writing. I'd prefer that one had an auto scroll feature.

A: For reading tabs, I like Songsterr Plus, have heard good things about TabToolkit too. For writing tabs, Progression and Guitar Script supposedly both quite good, haven't tried either of them myself, though.
