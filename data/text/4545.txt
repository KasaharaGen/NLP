Q: Free OS X solution for getting screenshots, cropping and annotating them I am looking for a simple/fast, free solution that will allow me to get screenshots from different windows, crop areas that are interesting to me and adding some comments to them.
It's main use case would be to track UI changes in applications, so it would be a good idea to support layers.
On Windows I was using Paint.NET but this is not available on OS X. Also, do not recommend GIMP, it's free but not simple and loads really slowly.

A: If you prefer an all-in-one solution to the Grab + Preview combination, try Skitch.
The lite version is free and should be enough for your -described- needs.

A: If you are interested in a portion of the screen, try Cmd+Shift+4, which turns the cursor to a crosshair; you can then select the portion of the screen and it will be captured to your desktop. By the way, Cmd+Shift+3 captures the whole screen. As far as annotation, you can follow jm666's suggestion and use Preview.

A: i am using jing from techsmith for a long time now and enjoy it very much:

you can even record screencasts in the free version. and it's cross platform (windows and osx).

A: Use Apple's built-in Grab.app to capture screenshots, Apple's built-in Preview.app to crop, and the open-source Inkscape to annotate the bitmap.

A: You can do everything from OS X’s Preview app.
Under File you’ll find Take Screen Shot. After you take it, the image will open directly in preview, and you can use the Annotate options under Tools, and more that appear from Show Edit Toolbar under View.
