Q: Prettify OS X console by coloring output? OS X terminal is not using colors for highlighting output from different commands, for example ls. 
When compared with other systems like Ubuntu, this is a big loss of accessibility/productivity.
What solutions do I have to improve this experience? For the moment I found only this guide for colored ls output under OS X but I am looking for a more complete solution.

A: You can easily change the ls output color by installing "TerminalColors" plugin. I am a big fan of "Solarize" theme which looks terrific on my Mac.

A: *

*you should change the Terminal.app preferences->advanced into xterm-color.

*enter the following into your ~/.profile


for enable colored ls:
export CLICOLOR=1;
export LSCOLORS=exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad;

and from now, you will get colored ls output.
