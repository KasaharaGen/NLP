Q: Is there a replacement glass panel for iPad that is "matte"? I had broken my Unibody MacBook screen and took the opportunity to replace it with a matte screen, via TechRestore.  I loved the improvement, as I dislike glossiness in almost every context.  Even my car is painted matte!


Anyways, I stupidly broke the glass on my 3G iPad1 today and want to replace the glass with a "matte" version...  Is there anything like this anywhere?
I know I can get a film or what not, but it's just not as satisfying.  So far, I've found a steady stream of probably-good-enough faux-OEM glass panels on eBay starting at $50 each (with the hilariously name spooge tool, included!)
But they're all glossy!!  I hate the gloss!!
Does anyone know where I can get some matte replacement glass for my iPad?

A: If I were you I would:


*

*repair screen at local apple authorized service provider

*cover new new screen with a new matte screen protector for ipad 1

1 Please read reviews before buying one, because some people complain about different issues like a little blurred screen, grain etc.
