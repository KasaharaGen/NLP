Q: IP Masquerading Mac OS X I am trying to figure out how to use this command with mac os x
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE

The only thing I have found that seems like it might work is
ipfw add m all from me to 0.0.0.0/0

but I get: ipfw: invalid action m\n'
Does anybody know how I could translate the iptable code to mac compatible code?

A: If you are just trying to share your internet connection, you can do this from System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing
If that's not why you posted this and you still do it manually(see Eir Nym's post). Don't forget to:
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1


A: You can try something like following. Please, read all details here. I hope this is working with non-server Lion (as FreeBSD nature of this OS), but I haven't tested it. 
 ipfw add 00010 divert natd ip from any to any via (ext int name here)
 /usr/sbin/natd -config /path/to/SL/natd.conf.apple


A: Below are the steps needed to set this up. en0 in this case is the external interface:
/usr/sbin/natd -interface en0
/sbin/ipfw -f flush
/sbin/ipfw add divert natd all from any to any via en0
/sbin/ipfw add pass all from any to any
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
