Q: Where's the # key in Lion In Snow Leopard alt-3 used to print a #, in Lion it doesn't. 
I'v tried different key combination keyboard viewer but still no luck.
Any ideas were the # key went?

A: Since it varies by keyboard layout - why not open your keyboard viewer and find out?
In the US keyboard layout on lion, it's still shift + 3

You have to select this from the menu bar after enabling it in the menu bar


A: It's still Alt-3 on my UK keyboard -- ###.

A: I like to use the widget:
CharacterPal
Searching and copying a needed character is faster than with the keyboard viewer:

*

*You do can look through all characers at once. With the keyboard viewer you need to hold ⌥ and ⇧ to see more characters.

*Characters are sorteded by type: greek, keyboard, math...

*TOP: You can find special (keyboard) symbols like ⌦, ⌘, ⎋, ⏏, ⌤ ...




A: You're talking about the hash key? Doesn't it print when you press Shift+3 ? Or maybe your keyboard layout is different but on every keyboard I've seen in the United States that's where the hash key lives.

A: on a french keyboard # is: alt-shift-£
crazy huh?
