Q: I noticed a .myPassword file in my home folder root. Is this supposed to be there? I ran "$ ls -a" in Terminal from my home directory and it listed a .myPassword file which contained my user account password. Is this file where the password is stored? It seems like it should not be that accessible. 

A: This is not where your password is stored.  At least by the system, no way.  I don't have one there, which tells me you have a 3rd-party app that's doing this.  Take a close look.
