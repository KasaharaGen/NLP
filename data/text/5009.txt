Q: My Developer Account cannot be activated because I used a relative's credit card So now I have an "identity cannot be verified" message whenever I activate it from the activation code Apple gave me via email.
Is there anything I can do about this or is my $99 "doomed"?

A: From the iOS Developer Program Support:

If I enroll as an Individual in the Standard program can I use someone elseâ€™s credit card to purchase the Program?
The billing information provided for
  the purchase must exactly match the
  Program enrollment information. If
  this information does not match your
  enrollment will be delayed and you
  will be asked to provide a notarized
  copy of a government issued
  identification.

I would contact support and ask them what to do next.

A: I have used other individual's credit cards for this purpose.  You should have no problem after phoning Developer Support Hotline http://developer.apple.com/contact/phone.html
Occasionally it gets stuck for no apparent reason that Apple could explain.  Happened to a client of mine yesterday.  We phoned and all was made well in minutes.

A: You will have to get in touch with Apple and perhaps they will ask your relative to call, because they will want to make sure that you didn't "steal" the credit card. Other than that, you're not "doomed" in any way.
