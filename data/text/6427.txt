Q: Is vHub Updater for VisualHub legit? I got a newsletter to go to store.kagi.com It's an offer to buy an update to the discontinued video converting software Visualhub by Techspansion. What makes it a bit suspicious that there is no contact whatsoever to ask if this is the real deal. I'm a fan of Visualhub no question but an anon update to a discontinued product? Would you buy this though?
