Q: Does appleutd@xmr3.com belong to the Apple up to date program? I applied for the apple up to date program through their site and got now the e-mail with a password protected pdf attachment in it. Xmr3 doesn't really sound like apple. Has anybody some additional info on this?
NOTE: I didn't visit their site because the WOT add-on in safari rated the website with a poor reputation score.

A: I wonder if you signed up for their Up to Date Program on a web page pretending to be the Apple website. That PDF is most likely a scam, do not open it--It could execute some malicious code. In the last seven years I have yet to see e-mail communication from Apple that does not come from apple.com. Also, I think all of their invoicing is done by using HTML-formatted e-mail messages sent to your Apple ID, not PDF's. Hope this helps. 

A: It appears that xmr3.com is a spammer domain. Google "xmr3.com spam" and you'll get a large number of links to scams that have run through that domain over the years.
I can't remember the last time, if ever, Apple has sent out a password protected PDF. Best not to mess with it.
I suggest you call AppleCare to make sure that you are properly signed up for the Apple Up to Date program. 

A: The Offical Answer is that OS X Codes are sent through the domain xmr3.com (I suspect that he meant the sender appleutd@xmr3.com)
Source: I first called the Apple Support hotline and they said that I must contact the iTunes Store through express lane on theyr site. Express Lane didn't work at that moment so I went through the contact sheet http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact.html and got my answer.

A: appleutd@xmr3.com is not a scam. I received an email containing encrypted PDF. The email said password to unlock the PDF will follow and today it did. I unlocked the PDF and it contained the redeem code also it contained the reference number i got when submitting the up to date form. That number matched. Redeem code worked.
