Q: iChat periodically disconnects About twice a night, iChat will disconnect (though it'll still show me as connected).  After about 10 minutes, it'll realize it's disconnected and bring up a dialog telling me it lost the connection.  I can then close the dialog and reconnect with no trouble.
My computer's network connection seems to be fine throughout this.
Any idea:


*

*What might might be causing this?

*How to fix it?

*At least how to make it tell me more immediately when it loses the connection?


A: Your problem might be your router loosing connection temporarily to your ISP.
I use Chax, an extension to iChat which, among other great things, auto-reconnects when connection is lost. Chax is donationware.
