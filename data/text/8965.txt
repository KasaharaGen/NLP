Q: Devs, can 3rd party apps access Safari's Reading List? Any chance iOS 5 lets devs access Reading List in Safari? A potential Read Later option for Twitter clients, etc.
I've been asking devs through Twitter for a while, but am yet to hear anything back.

A: Well, I don't think there is official support for third-party access to the reading list from Apple, but I know they are stored in this file on the Mac, and I would assume it is the same on iOS, or close to:

~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist

Just look for a key that has an entry named "Title" and a key value of "com.apple.ReadingList". It's the last one in my own file, but I don't expect it to be like this all the way.
And I suggest looking at it with a property list editor, like Xcode 4, it's a binary property list, doesn't look right when opened in TextEdit or other similar app.
