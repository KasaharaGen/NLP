Q: How can I make preferences boxes open in correct display with SecondBar? I've just started using SecondBar to provide a menubar for applications that I display in an external monitor. It's a big help, except for one thing: dialog boxes (like Apple Menu -> System Preferences, or Firefox's add-ins) open in the main display.
Is there any way to make dialog boxes open in whichever display the menubar was clicked from? So that if I use the main Mac menu bar for apps in my main display, the dialog opens in the main display, and if I use the SecondBar menu in my external display the dialog opens in the external display?

A: I'm not familiar with how SecondBar works, but it looks like it's just a hack that duplicates the menubar on an external monitor. There's no operating system support for a second menubar so no support for determining which menubar was clicked and which monitor to open the dialog in.
Perhaps the developer of SecondBar could somehow intercept the command and redirect the dialog, but I really doubt this low-level jiggery-pokery is possible.
