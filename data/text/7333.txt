Q: How to send 'print' key with RDC (Remote Desktop Connection)? I use Microsoft's RDC on Mac. I need to click on print key to have some screen capture, but Mac Keyboard doesn't have one.
How do I send print key with Mac through RDC?

A: Try Option + F4- it worked for me!

A: 
The MS RDC has a preference menu so that you can customize the shortcuts.

A: Try using the virtual keyboard windows has under the "accessibility" programs menu

A: Shift+Control+3
⇧+Ctrl+3
It worked for me! (I'm using rdesktop on Linux > Windows Server 2012 R2, with -K option).

A: The print screen command on a Mac is:
Shift+Command+3 
⇧⌘3
So on Windows it would most likely be:
Shift+Control+3
⇧Ctrl3
