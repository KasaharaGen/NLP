Q: Is there a way to reach the multitasking bar on the iPad via a keystroke on the keyboard dock? When the iPad is plugged into the keyboard dock, you can reach the home screen by pressing the "square" button in the upper left corner of the dock's keyboard. Is there a keyboard analogue to the double-press that brings up the multitasking bar, or do you have to reach for the physical button?

A: Double-hitting the Home key (at the Escape key place) will bring the multitasking bar much like the Home button on your iPad.
Confirmed on my iPad Apple keyboard dock.
