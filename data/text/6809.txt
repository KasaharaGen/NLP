Q: How to remove an accidentally dropped file shortcut icon from Finder toolbar? I accidentally dropped a file in the Finder toolbar instead of the destination folder (the ZIP icon on the right of the screenshot):

How can I remove it from the toolbar?

A: *

*Hold down ⌘ Command

*Click file and drag it out


A: Maybe it's different on older versions of the OS, but I'm running OS X Lion, and I have to hold ⌘ + ⌥ and then drag it off.

A: I had this issue with a bunch of my files, until I realized that like all toolbars, there's a default set. Here's how to restore it:
Control-click (right-click) the menu bar and click Customize Toolbar...

In the sheet that presents itself, drag the default menu bar on top of your "messy" one.


A: I had this problem, too.  Right click, select "customize toolbar," THEN just drag the folder out of the toolbar.  No need to hold Cmd.

A: You need to hold down Command ⌘ and Fn and then drag the file off the toolbar.
