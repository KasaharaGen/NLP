Q: connecting a PS2 keyboard to Mac I have a keyboard that has only a PS2 interface. I tried setting a PS2 to USB connector over it and connected to Mac. The keyboard does not work. It works fine on a Windows XP though. 
Is there a way I can get this PS2 interfaced keyboard to work for Mac ? (assuming there is no information on support of Mac)

A: It looks like you need something like this (Good info on the page too). I've never used one of those so I can't vouch for the specific device or vendor.
