Q: Create audiobook from mp3 files? How do I transfer a folder containing mp3 files to my iPod/iTunes to be recognized as an audiobook?

A: I use iTunes 10 in Windows 7.

*Select the tracks.

*Right-click and select Get Info.

*Open the Options tab.

*Set:
Equilizer Preset = Spoken Word
Media Kind = Audiobook
Part of a compilation = No

Also, make sure the correct track numbers and disc numbers are set for each track.

A: I used to do the method that Hand-E-Food used. It works fine, but you still end up with a ton of individual mp3 files. This was a pain for me because of the way they showed up when I plug them into my car stereo. 
After a bunch of looking around, I found AudioBook Builder. It takes all the mp3 files and converts them into a single .m4b audiobook file. Assuming you are on a Mac, it's worth a look.
The app is available directly in the App Store. I've only used it a few times, but that's only because I don't have that many audio books. It was quick and easy and more than worth the price for the hassle it saved me.
