Q: Getting Applications location in Automator How do I get the directory where the app created in automator resides?
Example:


*

*Create App using automator

*Save to ~/Documents/Automator

*Run automator app, which does something in it's directory


A: Add an AppleScript step which contains:
on run {input, parameters}

    set p to POSIX path of (path to me)
    return {p}

    return input
end run

From there, you can use the "p" parameter.
