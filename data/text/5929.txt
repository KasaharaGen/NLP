Q: What happened to the Finder window 'jellybean' in OS X Lion? Before I updated to Lion, whenever I would mount a disk image (.dmg) the Finder window that would pop-up would always have a little 'jellybean' in the top right corner that would expand this window into a 'full' Finder window with the left-side panel, thus allowing quick and easy access to be able to eject the disk image.

I do not know if this feature has been completely removed from the OS or if its just disabled. Is there a way to get this back? I miss the jellybean!

A: Note that the lozenge or "jellybean" as you call it used to show and hide the toolbar.  Pre-Lion, it did exactly the same thing as the cmd-opt-T keyboard shortcut, and this shortcut remains in effect in Lion.
Lion adds a new cmd-opt-S shortcut which toggles only the sidebar (which is in any event displayed only when the toolbar is already present).

A: It was removed completely in Lion.
To eject disk images I normally just drag the icon in the window title to the trash. Quick and simple. You can also right click on the window background and eject it via the context menu.

A: The jellybean was removed completely in Lion. However, keystroke Opt-Cmd-T or menu option View - Show Toolbar will achieve the same thing.
I miss the jellybean too!

A: You can also eject with a keyboard shortcut:


*

*Select the Finder window of the disk image (click the background to deselect anything).


*Press Command+E to eject the disk image.
