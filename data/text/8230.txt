Q: iOS 5 change AppStore language After upgrading to iOS 5 my AppStore language changed to German. Referring to that quesiton it is possible to change the language by selecting the country in iTunes like it is described in this apple KB.
My problem is the following : I have a Swiss AppStore account, as you may know Switzerland has many official languages (German, French, Italian, ...) that why a Swiss AppStore account could be in German, French or English as default language.
Before upgrading to iOS 5, the AppStore language was in English as I want it.
I've tried the solution given by the Apple KB. But even doing so, you can only select the country but not the language (German is the first language in Switzerland, that's why it falls back to german). By the way, when I go to the iTunes store the language is also German.
I have tried to set English as default language in the following places :


*

*iOS's language in ENG

*iCloud.com account in ENG

*MacOSX Lion's language where I have my iTunes in also ENG


Where can I specify the language so the AppStore & iTunes Store language will be in english ?

A: Settings -> General -> International -> Language -> Make sure it's set to English.
If this doesn't work, SYNC to your computer and see if it goes back.
