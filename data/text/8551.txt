Q: Hold mouse at the edge of the screen to jump to other monitor on Mac OS X Lion I just set up my new TV on the wall above my iMac, so I arranged the external monitor above the main one in the preferences. The problem is that it got very hard to access my menu bar on top of my main monitor, when I move my mouse up so fast it would jump to the other screen! So I have to be precise and move my mouse slowly every time I want to hit something on my menu bar.
The question is, is there a way that I would have to hold my mouse on the edge of the screen to jump to the other monitor instead of it jumping right away?

A: Not by default in OS X there isn't a way to do that, and I don't know of any third-party utilities that do that either.
You could put the TV on an upper corner of the monitor (see below for ASCII art). Then you'd only be using a corner to transit the screens, not the whole top of the monitor.
