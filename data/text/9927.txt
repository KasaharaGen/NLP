Q: .app appended to all apps in Applications folder When I open my applications folder, all the apps inside have their name below the icons appended with the text .app. I don't think it used to be this way, is there a way to remove the .app text? I'm on OS X snow leopard.

A: Go to Finder->Preferences->Advanced->Show all filename extensions
