Q: iPhone application to edit text files I need to edit some local text files on my iPhone but so far, all the apps I have downloaded do not navigate the OS3 file tree for me to open, edit and save them.
I need to do this on my iPhone as I can no longer access it via ssh or with the iPhone cable. One of the files I want to edit is an ssh config file which is what is not allowing ssh connections.
Any suggestions of applications or other simple methods that I could use?

A: You can do this with iFile.
This application will let you browse the local file system.
Locate your config file, then open it using the built-in Text Viewer
(it also has viewers/players for other file formats such as PDF or MP3).
Despite the name the Text Viewer will actually let you edit and save the file.

A: Try this https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pretext/id1347707000 that wonâ€™t require jailbreak
