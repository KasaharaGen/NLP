Q: Apple Shortcut Icon I'm pretty sure this is the best site for the this question, if not please feel free to point in a different direction,
I am using the Mac version of Eclipse and I'm stumped as to what the Keyboard Shortcut for "Run as.." is.
The image looks like this:

I recognize the COMMAND key and the OPTION key, but whats the X key?
Thanks!

A: You hold down ⌥+⌘ simultaneously, then you press the X which open a small yellow popup like this:

where you then press J - and after that you release ⌥+⌘.

A: That's the X on your keyboard.
In Eclipse you have to press the ⌥ ⌘ X simultaneously and then release all of them and press J.
