I know, that my iMac has Wi-Fi access point.
How can I share the internet connection of iMac with iPad?

A: The answer you're looking for, though, is Internet Sharing:


*

*Go into the System Preferences on your iMac

*Go to Sharing, then click on Internet Sharing

*In the dropdown, indicate that you want to "Share your connection from" Ethernet

*Check the Airport box

*You have the option to set your network name, channel, and to use WEP encryption by clicking "Airport Options".

*Finally, check the box next to "Internet Sharing" on the left hand side.

*At the prompt, click Start.


You should now be able to connect to the internet on your iPad by selecting the network you set up on your iMac.
USB sharing is also now easy and fast: Can I share my iMac's internet to iPhone or iPad over USB?

A: You can also share connectivity with iOS by USB cable (if you can not use WiFi), but it is little hacky: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/232937/98580
