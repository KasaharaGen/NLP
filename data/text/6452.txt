Q: My iOS 5 Beta 1 Expired! Now what? I recently brought an iPod 4g. And one of my friend who was an iPhone application developer helped me upgrade my os to iOS 5 Beta 1. Now he is out of station and my iPod is locked. 
I cannot do anything with my iPod. 
Please advice me on how to degrade the OS to my previous version? 
Thanks & Regards,

A: Well, this is timely.
Download the iOS 4.3.5 iPod touch firmware image, put your iPod touch in DFU mode, then use iTunes to restore to 4.3.5:


*

*Launch iTunes.

*Connect your iPod to your computer.

*Shut it down by pressing and holding the power button for five seconds, then sliding to the right.

*Press and hold the home and power buttons for ten seconds. Afterwards, release the power button, but continue to press the home button until iTunes detects the iPod.

*If iTunes doesn't ask you for the file, âŒ¥-click the Restore button. This should let you select the .ipsw file you have downloaded.


A: Not sure you can downgrade but try: Settings -> General -> Software Update ... there have been new Beta's so that might solve the problem.
