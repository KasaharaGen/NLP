Q: Are there any consumer style websites that offer WebDav support? iWork for iPad now has WebDav export/import options, DropBox doesn't support WebDav.
Where can I find a service that has WebDav support? Besides setting up my own server, is there any consumer (and ideally free) site that does this?

A: The Omni Group Forum thread, List of free webDAV sync providers, has links to a number of  possibilities.

A: I believe you are looking for Box.NET. It has WebDav access (among other things)
