Q: How can I combine multiple photos into a single image on my iPhone? I want to combine multiple photos like this

I tried  many apps like diptic, picstich and many more.
But they all combine like this.

Just a bit of clarification: I don't want to create panorama, don't want to stitch and mix images. I just want to add multiple images horizontally or vertically.

A: Have you looked at Frame Magic. There's a free version and a 99Â¢ version
