Q: Fill rectangle with diagonal lines (stripes) in keynote I want to create a rectangle in keynote which is filled with diagonal lines, like shown in the example image.

How can I do this?

A: After some searching about, it would appear that you cannot do this in Keynote; however, you can import an image (like the one in your question) and then do what you will with it.

A: Old post, I know.
Just searched for the same question. Read this post, did the following.


*

*Open blank keynote document

*Draw a vertical full height line, 2 point, in my preferred colour.

*Duplicated the line a dozen times

*Selected all and duplicated the selection a few more times

*Used align to make sure all lines were vertically positioned the same way

*Moved one line to the right edge of the slide

*Used distribute to set the distance between objects

*Used rotate in the inspector to rotate all lines 45 degrees

*Exported as a pdf

*Opened my original document and dragged the pdf into it

*Double clicked and used default keynote tools to mask to the shape I wanted


Hope that helps someone else.
