Q: How can I listen to free radio on an iPhone? Is it possible to listen to the radio for free on the iPhone? 
Do I need a special app? 
I have downloaded some apps for digital radio that require payment, but I just want to listen to regular free radio

A: If you're referring to normal, terrestrial radio such as you'd get in your car or a cheap clock radio, the answer is that you cannot. At least, not without buying a receiver, something like this Griffin radio receiver.

A: There are radio apps in the iPhone app store that will give you radio stations in your area and elsewhere.

A: At the risk of stating the obvious, you can listen to Pandora—internet radio—for free on your iPhone.  And for a small fee you can listen without advertisements. 

A: There's a good radio app called Tunein Radio Pro which allows you to listen to over 50,000 radio stations across the world and which is cheap to buy, $0.99 in the US.  There's also a non-Pro version which is free.
