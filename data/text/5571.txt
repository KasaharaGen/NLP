Q: Safari 5.1 (OS X Lion) Inspect Element / Web Inspector always pops up and is not docked to main window Been using OS X 10.7 Lion since early developer previews and there is this bug (or feature that's not implemented). Clicking Inspect Element/Web Inspector of the Develop tools will always pop up the Web Inspector window. It used to be stuck or used to remember my preference and used it as default.
It is docked by default on Chrome and FireBug is well docked in Firefox and it was docked by default (or remember my settings) in Safari 5 on Snow Leopard.
Anyone faced this issue and have a fix?
Much appreciated. 

A: At the bottom left hand corner of the popup there is a little button that looks like a dark square with a white square in it. That button pops the inspector in and out. 
Don't know if that will fix your problem but you can try

A: Since I actually like to use it as a separate window, it does not bother me that much. However, the thing that drives me to the edge of suicide is the change that AJAX requests are not logged if the Web Inspector is not open. My usual development workflow of testing the UI -> in case something is broken, open Web Inspector -> check what's happening has been completely broken -- now I need to open Web Inspector and try to repeat the bug. Grrh, why Apple why?

A: See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6819523/safari-web-inspector-showing-up-in-new-window-by-default ; this is a bug that has been reported and appears to be fixed in the nightlies.
