Q: Connecting headset to iPhone's iPod player I have a Plantronics ML10 headset and after setting it up through bluetooth it can handle calls. But when I play music with my IPhone, the sound is not coming through the earpiece. 
Is there anyway I could "channel" the sound to the earpiece whenever I play songs with the iPhone?

A: Sorry, but I don't think it will work. To send music over Bluetooth, the device needs to support the A2DP Bluetooth profile. Your headset (and most others not specifically intended for music) only supports the basic handsfree profile, so the iPhone can't send it music from the iPod app.
