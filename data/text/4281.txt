Q: Third-party service that syncs preferences? Like MobileMe Are there any third-party software or services that offer synchronization of user-preferences the same way that MobileMe does?
Iâ€™m thinking of the user defaults that live inside ~/Library/Preferences/
With conflict resolution and merging of property lists, of course.

A: I've got a system set up with Dropbox to do something like this.  I have several settings files (.profile, .gitconfig, ~/Applications, etc) living in my Dropbox, and then I run a script to iterate through them and set up symlinks to their appropriate location.
You could probably do something similar, perhaps even by symlinking your entire ~/Library/Application Support folder.
