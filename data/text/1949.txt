Q: Time capsule speed issues Whenever I browse my Time Capsule's AirPort Disk, it seems very slow in simply listing the files it has. I am looking in directories with upwards of fifty music files in each. 
Scrolling is really slow. I have turned of Icon Preview in the View Options etc. But it's still slow.
Anyone know how I can speed it up?
Thanks.

A: This is the nature of wireless networks and Apple's AFP protocol. I'd reccomend either connecting to a wired network to browse your music, or using the command line to find what you're looking for, as Finder adds a deal of latency to the file-listing process.
