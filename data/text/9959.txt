Q: How to update company's MacBook Pro with OS X Lion? How a company I work for should update my MacBook Pro to Lion? I have some options but I'm unsure which way to go?
Note: volume license is not an option (not that many Macs at my company).

*Update to Lion using my Apple ID and ask for reimbursement. Cons: not
quite the right thing IMO as license is on myself then. Pro: pricing (€23.99)

*Ask company to buy an USB stick with update. Pros: seems the
easiest way. Cons: pricing is at €59.99, so the company may not be willing to go that way when the update is cheaper in App Store.

*Maybe a company can update via App Store by logging in with
company's Apple ID?


What you recommend? What's your experience?

A: The company should have an Apple ID set up. I would recommend that this is registered to a member of the IT team who is most responsible for software purchasing.
Then they can download OS X Lion from the app store, and have the license.
Is there a business requirement to be running Lion or is this user preference?
