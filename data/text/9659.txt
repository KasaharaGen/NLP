Q: Is there a way to build a simple iPad pen yourself? I wonder about the technology used by the multitouch and the pens and brushes that are sold. Is this really high technology or can we build a pen for ipad ourself ?

A: Well, http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/05/diy-ipad-stylus-actually-extremely-easy-to-make/ looks interesting.
It seems that the ipad screen reacts to conductive surfaces, so if you can make one of those your point on a stylus, you're set.

A: Here's a Walt MossPuppet video on making on a stylus out of a protein bar wrapper:
