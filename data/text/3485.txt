Q: What is the best Subversion GUI? I'm looking for "the best" SVN GUI/manager for Mac OS, allowing things like line by line comparison, merging, branching, ...
I tried Versions for a few days but now I found that Cornerstone might be a good alternative (better ?).
I was wondering if anyone would have some feedback on these two apps (or on others ...).

A: I've used both, bought Versions in the end. They were both about equal in my use cases. What really helped was adding Kaleidoscope to my tool box and using it for diffs instead of the XCode diff engine or the simple diff engine in Versions. 

A: It's really subjective, but IMHO it's Cornerstone. In my setup I use:


*

*Cornerstone

*Kaleidoscope

*svnX

*svn via iTerm2


A: svnX

SvnX is an open source GUI for most features of the svn client binary. It allows you to browse your working copies, spot changes and operate on them but also to browse logs and revisions of your repositories 


A: Nice GUI, freeware, multiple function: SourceTree
