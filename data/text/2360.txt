Q: How to run Applescript on Disk mount I want to run an Applescript when I mount a specific disk. It isn't if the script is located on the disk or not, it should just run when OS X mounts the disk.
I tried to accomplish this with folder actions, but it looks like it isn't possible to do it this way.
Clarification:


*

*I get home with my Macbook

*I plug my USB Hub into the device

*External disks are mounted in OS X

*My Applescript gets run, does some stuff on those disks 


I want to automate step 4.

A: You don't mention under which context you are mounting the disk, but what about going the other way and mounting the disk with the Applescript? 
I mention context because when mounting a disk with Applescript is the big caveat that if it is a network volume, and the network is password-protected, then the user name and password would have to be stored as plain text in the script for a seamless execution.
UPDATE: A bit of searching found a similar question elsewhere. Essentially, a script can be made to do this by applying the script as a Folder Action to /Volumes: 
on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items
    repeat with aItem in these_items
        tell application "Finder"
            if (local volume of aItem) and (name of aItem is "[Name of Hard Drive]") then
                -- do something with the drive
                -- eject aItem
            end if
        end tell
    end repeat
end adding folder items to


A: Use a Finder FolderAction that monitors /Volumes. When a new folder appears, that means a new disk has been attached. Now your FolderAction can run an Automator action, AppleScript, or shell script to do your thing.

A: The likely most robust solution is to create a launchd job with the StartOnMount property set to -boolean YES:

StartOnMount <boolean>
  This optional key causes the job to be started every time a filesystem is mounted.

This is how Time Machine does it (see /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-attach.plist).

A: MarcoPolo can do actions based on disk attachment.

A: A solution would be to create an Automator application chaining the 3 following actions :


*

*Get Specified Finder Items 

*Mount Disk Image

*Run AppleScript


A: Depending on your needs, this can be applied to specific folder/mount points and is great to use when mounting a USB flash drive for example...
