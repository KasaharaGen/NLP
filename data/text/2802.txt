Q: Cold temperatures cause finger resistance on  iPad screen I have an issue that I've been experiencing: semi-cold fingers, iPad, and/or room make for a very stubborn drawing experience (I'm an artist that uses the iPad).
I'm talking indoors, and it doesn't have to be that cold to trigger the problem: even slightly below normal room temperature.
There's a real resistance that happens. My fingers don't seamlessly glide around. Slows me down like heck.
I can't figure out how to fix it (I can rub my fingers quickly on my pants to create friction for a very quick fix).
Could this be a humidity or a room pressure thing?
It's not about too little oil on one's fingers or if the glass is clean. I can't find anything online, although I've talked to some folks who say they sometimes have this problem with their smartphones.
Anyone know anything about this; and, more importantly, how to circumvent it in a reasonable way?

A: I've had similar issues, and my guess has been that it's due to poor circulation when the temperature drops.
The solutions I've come up with are to buy either:


*

*a stylus

*a pair of gloves with conductive tips (like these)

*something like the GloveTips 3-Piece Touchscreen Texting Glove Tips (which you can apply to an existing pair of gloves).


A: Use some hand lotion or wash your hands and then try again. Dry fingers may cause that.

A: A lot people find anti-glare screen protectors do the trick! They're slightly textured.
