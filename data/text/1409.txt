Q: Ethernet via Cinema Display I want Ethernet on a MacBook Air running in clamshell mode.  Will the USB<-->Ethernet trinket work from the Cinema Display?

A: I’ve seen people have an external powered Hub connected to the Air, then connect the USB to Ethernet trinket to the hub and have no problems with it. If the Cinema Display functions as a normal hub, then you should have no problems with it. 
The USB specification doesn’t make distinctions from internal/external ports (in theory).
