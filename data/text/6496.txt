Q: Why is the filesize of downloaded disk image different? I have a disk image which I uploaded to a web server and then downloaded with Safari 5.1 in OS X 10.7.
Finder reports the original as 34,911,334 bytes, and the downloaded file as 34,909,684. Both appear to contain identical contents when mounted.
What's going on here?
Edit: See output of ls -l@ and md5 as suggested:
$ ls -l@

$ md5 Original.dmg
MD5 (Original.dmg) = 4c1ed7a85de6ae51479a136ea23ac69e

$ md5 Downloaded.dmg
MD5 (Downloaded.dmg) = 4c1ed7a85de6ae51479a136ea23ac69e


A: The difference of 1650 bytes is probably the result of the resource fork being stripped from the uploaded disk image.
To test, I created a disk image from a folder in Disk Utility. I then used 
ls -l@

in the folder that contained the disk image, and it showed the image had a resource fork that was 1650 bytes.
