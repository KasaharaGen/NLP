Q: Built-in WebDAV client able to connect via HTTPS with client certificate? Using Mac OS 10.6.8, I'm trying to connect via HTTPS to a WebDAV server that requires client certificates. Without luck so far. The certificate is stored in the keychain.
Is this possible with the built-in WebDAV client?  
Are there alternatives that integrate somewhat smoothly?

A: This question on the apple discussion board suggests that it is not possible through Finder, but works in Firefox.
