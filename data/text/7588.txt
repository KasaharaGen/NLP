Q: How do you test network speed without an app? The usual Internet speed test is written in Flash. Is there an HTML one that works with iPad and iPhone?

A: SpeedTest.net has an iPad/iPhone/iPod app.

A: Try http://speedof.me
It use html5 and works without flash.
You can also see your bandwidth graph which is interesting.

A: ISPGeeks.com has a non-flash java based bandwidth tester. It pretty accurately measured the speed of my iPad on my home connection, as compared to similar tests on the usual Flash-based sites.

A: dslreports.com is my go-to resource for carrier/network info and diagnostics. Free membership, no spam, genuine user generated content, reviews, and support all are part.  The "tools" section is very robust.
