Q: Importing vCards from a website into iOS’s Contacts.app I have a web page with tables full of people & their contact information. I started writing a pairing of php & javascript to automagically generate vCards (*.vcf) for each contact. Half way through this process I’ve discovered that iOS is none too cooperative with .vcf downloaded by Mobile Safari.
When a .vcf files is received via MMS or as an email attachment, iOS provides a very obvious & simple interface for adding it as a new contact. I expected Mobile Safari to exhibit similar behavior to Messages & Mail, but that is not the case.
With Dropbox installed, on my iPhone or iPad, things look like:
Mobile Safari “handles” a .vcf file http://mlkshk.com/r/66OX
Without Dropbox installed, Mobile Safari just throws up its hands and says it cannot download the file.
Anyone have a way forward on this one? Is there a way to coerce Mobile Safari into doing something meaningful with the .vcf file? Will this be supported in iOS 5? Wy on earth is it not supported now? Is there another way to markup the contact information so that Mobile Safari will allow for seamless creation of a new entry in Contacts? Microformats, serving the .vcf up with a MIME of text/plain, some markup & JavaScript bookmarklet (clumsy and awkward as they may be), etc. ?
N.B.

*I want to know if this can be done on iOS using Mobile Safari. I’m
not looking for work arounds that involve syncing with a desktop
machine, using Dropbox, or some other 3rd party app.

*Yes, I
understand that sending a user the .vcf file as an attachment via
email is an option (a terrible, time consuming, non-elegant option
which requires the user to enter their email address without typos
or otherwise bolloxing things up).

*I also understand that <a
href="tel:+1 617.555.1234">phone</a> can create a new contact with
a tap & hold (this too is a terrible, time consuming, non-elegant
option which requires the user to remember & then enter the
person’s name without typos, otherwise bolloxing things up, and then
forces them to tap, hold repeat, for each piece of info [phone,
email, address, home phone, home email, website, …])


A: I expect you found my solution on Stack Overflow but if not you can see the source code and full description at http://www.mobicontact.info or on Stack Overflow
BTW - it involves wrapping the VCARD (.vcf) file inside a Calendar appointment (.ics) which IS handled by mobile Safari.  All the required user agent sniffing and PHP to auto create the calendar appointement is included.  Feel free to use the code, post a comment or up vote on Stack Overflow to spread the word.  Enjoy and good luck.

A: Please check the manuals from iOS6. This should be possible via Safari. I called Apple Support, but unless there are enough people complaining about this, they won't fix it.

Method 5 Import VCF (vCard) contacts to iCloud directly

Note: You can edit the contacts information, add new contacts to the iCloud, or delete the repeated contacts by left-clicking the contact and tapping on “Delete” from the “Setting” button, all the changes of contacts will be reflected on your iPhone contacts too.

A: Mobile Safari does not handle downloaded files (including vcf) for security reasons.
Sending the vcf as a message attachment is the only current solution for transmitting  vCards or adding contacts via Mobile Safari.
An option you might consider is presenting visitors to the page the option to select (multiple) contacts that they wish to download, then generating a singly vCard with multiple contact data — so that the user wouldn't have to re-enter their email address each time (at least that makes it somewhat less laborious).
Somewhat more complex to set up, but perhaps simpler experience for the user, might be for you to set up SMS messaging via a gateway such as Amazon Web Services and give the user the option to enter their phone number to receive the vCard as an SMS.
Lastly, you may consider building a native first party app to provide your users with a list of available contacts and the ability to add them to their own Contacts.

A: Of course I forgot the other obvious answer, which is to set up something like a Google Apps account that stores all of the contacts, and then invite your users to configure their devices to use it. This way, contacts are stored and managed in a central location and can be updated.
(Since you are asking about sharing contact information, I assume this is a closed group that you are sharing data amongst, such as a business or school).
