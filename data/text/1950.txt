Q: Connecting iPhone to TV What cable do I need to display my iPhone on my TV?
I have a jailbroken iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.2.1.

A: The Apple Component AV Cable will let you connect from the iPhone's dock connector to RCA jacks on your TV. It won't be HD.
Standard Disclaimer: Since it's jailbroken, neither I or Apple can guarantee full/any support.
