Q: Can I stream music from my laptop to my iPod Touch over wifi? Rather than running a long cable from my Laptop to my stereo, I've been thinking for a while about getting one of those wireless devices that lets you transmit audio from your PC to a receiver plugged into the stereo.
Then I realised I already have hardware that can potentially do this - I have an iPod Touch, and a Wi-Fi network in the house.
So, is there some iPod Touch App that will let the iPod act as a Wi-Fi music receiver? And presumably, a corresponding piece of broadcast software for my (Windows Vista) Laptop?
edit: Bonus points for a solution that lets me stream all audio from the laptop, rather than just streaming music tracks.

A: You can use the Windows version of Airfoil to send any audio to an Airport Express connected to a stereo.  The page above claims it can do the same via an iPod Touch as well.  And you can try it for free.

A: You can also share your iTunes library on your Mac of PC and then stream your music from your computer to your iPod touch by selecting that shared iTunes library in the Music app on your iPod touch.
This solution doesn't require any extra software or app.

A: On the road I use the Simplify Media application to do this. It requires an application to be installed on both the computer and the iPod touch/iPhone. Once installed I can play almost any track from my desktop to my iPod touch.
However at my house the simplest solution I have found is to use an Airport Express. I use iTunes to manage my music and then choose to play it on the Airport Express which is connected to my stereo in the living room. I can then use my iPod touch as a remote for iTunes to control what plays.

A: You can use the wifi2hifi app to stream any audio from your Mac but not on your PC to your iOS device.
