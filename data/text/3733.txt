Q: Mounting cue/bin files There are many suggestions on the internet on how to use cue/bin files on a Mac.
Is there a native way of mounting cue or bin files and seeing them as Volumes in Finder?
Alternatively, are there any tools—in the vain of Daemon Tools on a Windows machine—that provide this functionality?
I would very much like avoid converting the files I have.

A: I use binchunker to convert .bin/.cue files to a single .iso file on my Mac. You can obtain binchunker via Homebrew or Macports.
Here's some more info from the manpage:
bchunk - CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr

SYNOPSIS
       bchunk [-v] [-p] [-r] [-w] [-s] <image.bin> <image.cue> <basename>

DESCRIPTION
       bchunk converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.

       The  bin/cue  format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing pro-
       grams.

       image.bin is the raw cd image file. image.cue is the track index file containing track types and  offsets.   basename
       is used for the beginning part of the created track files.

       The  produced .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or
       written on a CD-R using cdrecord.  The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can be either written on a
       CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using sox.

       It  is  advisable  to  edit  the  .cue  file to either MODE2/2352/2048 or MODE2/2352/2324 depending on whether an ISO
       filesystem or a VCD is desired, respectively.  The format itself does not contain this feature and  in  an  ambiguous
       case it can only guess.


A: Stuffit Expander (Select StuffIt Expander Only if you want to download it from that site, dont get any adware crap) can open bin files, and from what I remember cue files are just information maps about bin files. 
I forget if you can view them as Volumes, but that seems like a secondary concern, converting them is a lengthy process if you have more than a few files.

A: Have you tried Control+Click (right click) on the .bin file and open with Disk Utility?

A: I've just used Unarchiver and its extracted all the files in the .bin and i've been able to get the .wmv files that way.

A: You can get Daemon tools free trial for OSX to mount bin file.
