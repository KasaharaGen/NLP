Q: What is the best way to open an 80GB iPod classic? I'm looking for the best way to open an iPod classic, meaning taking it apart. Mine got wet and now doesn't work and I would like to open it up and check that everythin's in place. I would like to do so in the safest way, so as not to dent the iPod. Any suggestions?

A: All you need is the plastic opening tools and follow this iFixit guide.

A: I've had good luck opening iPods with guitar picks in the past without damaging them. You can put them in the side crack and use them as a lever if you are gentle with it. See here:
