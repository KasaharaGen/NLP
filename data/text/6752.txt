Q: How can I fix my Mac-Router-Mac network? My network is amazing slow, and my question is what can I do about it.
I have done the following analysis:
Transfer from MacBookPro -> Router -> Mac Mini Intel Core 1
264,3 MB = 2114, MBit in 432 seconds. == 4,89 MBPS
Transfer from MacBookPro  -> Mac Mini Intel Core 1 (Direct network)
264,3 MB = 2114, MBit in 295 seconds. == 7,16 MBPS
Transfer from MacBookPro -> Router -> MacBook Air
90,2 MB = 721,6 MBit in 147 seconds. == 4,90 MBPS
All connections via WLAN: 54 MBit/s, WPA2, WMM, autochannel.
Router is a FRITZ!Box WLAN 3170 
So, the router sucks a bit performance, thats OK. Anyway as the router shows me that all clients are connected with 54 MBit/s, shouldn't the transfer time less? What can I do/check to increase my networks speed?

A: Looks closer to 802.11b than 802.11g, the speed advertised for wireless networks is confusingly not equivalent to an Ethernet cable of equivalent speed.

Basically buy an Apple Airport Extreme to replace your current system, and try to use the 5Ghz frequencies instead of 2.4Ghz as you are probably suffering from a lot of interference.
Example setting up with existing router:


A: One thing you can do is to make sure that your wireless router is using a channel that doesn't overlap with the channels of the other wireless networks around you. The frequencies of adjacent channels (e.g., 2 and 3) overlap, which can result in interference. Lifehacker has some good tips for picking a channel here.
