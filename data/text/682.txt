Q: Decompressing .sit file I have recently downloaded a .sit archive file.
Is there a way to decompress it at the command line?

A: The Unarchiver
Includes a commandline tool. Can unpack some SIT files. I think I have experienced problems with a few SIT files though.

A: I’m sure that Stuffit Deluxe has two command line utilities called stuff and unstuff (they're in /usr/local/bin) as far as I can remember. But you need the Deluxe payware version. 
If paying is not your idea, you could technically do the same using the free Stuffit Expander. You have to invoke it from the Terminal with something like:
osascript -e 'tell application "StuffIt Expander" to expand posix file “/path/to/full/file/compressedfile.sit”’

It might not be the best, but it should work.
