Q: ImageMagick Errors while installing dependencies I'm using this script:
https://github.com/maddox/magick-installer
to install imagemagick and it's dependencies
i have a few errors the first run for some missing files or borken links but now i have all this solved.... but when it's installing the libpng, i think, the scrip stops and trow this error:
ln: ./libtool: File exists
i don't know what to do, seems like the first run it created some symlink somewhere and not it found this symlink and stops the script.
thanks.

A: Try installing ImageMagick with HomeBrew 
https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew
Once installed just type 
brew install imagemagick

This will download any dependancies, compile the source and install it.
