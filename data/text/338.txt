Q: Make a link to login items? In the course of installing some app, I came across the following.
Put a link to it in your Login items to have it start up automatically when you login.
How can I do that? How to make a link to login items with Mac OS X?

*

*Open up the Accounts Preference Pane in System Preferences

*Click on your Account and the click on the Login Items tab on the right hand side of the window.

*Click the '+' button to navigate to the application or document you wish to open up on login.

*If you wish you can check off the "Hide" checkbox to hide the application by default after it launches during login.
