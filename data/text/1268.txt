Q: How can I change the VoiceOver language for a song on my 6th gen iPod Nano? Is it possible to change language used for reading song album/artist/title for certain songs? I.e. when I use slovak as default iPod nano language, but I have songs with english titles, I would like to hear those in english. I think this was available for previous iPod nanos, but I cannot find it in iTunes when syncing songs to 6th gen nano.
Update: This is how Options panel looks when I right-click on song stored on my iPod Nano (6th gen):

VoiceOver language is not there :-(

A: Right click on the song (you can select more than one), select "Get Info", choose the Options tab, and pick English for the voice over language.

If you don't see this in your info panel it means that the VoiceOver Kit is not installed: Follow the instructions on this KB Article to download and install it.
However those instructions do work on the Shuffle and the 5th generation Nano, but I just tried my daugther's 6th generation Nano and the check box is not there. Sorry.
