Q: Mac ports package name search from command line? I tried to install gnuchessc with Mac ports, but there's nothing like that.

sudo port install gnuchessc
Error: Port gnuchessc not found
Before reporting a bug, first run the command again with the -d flag to get complete output.

Actually, it should have been gnuchess not gnuchessc. Is there a way to let Mac Ports teach me that there is gnuchess instead of gnuchessc from command line? 

A: port search $TERM
The MacPorts Guide is really useful for these sorts of things.
