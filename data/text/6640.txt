Q: Can no longer download podcasts to iPhone I normally get new podcasts by doing the following on my iPhone:


*

*Go to my list of podcasts

*Select the podcast I'm interested in getting an episode for (e.g this week in google TWiG)

*Select 'Get More Episodes'
This takes me to iTunes where I can normally see a list of all the episodes and download the ones I want. However, all I see now is the podcast logo (e.g., This Week in Google), 
how many reviews the podcast has had, but no list of podcasts.


I've tried deleting a podcast (by deleting all the episodes on my iPhone) and then trying to add it again via iTunes, but still no list of podcasts.
Where has the list of podcasts gone? How do I get them back?

A: Which version of iOS are you running? I've just checked and it's fine for me so it's not a server side problem. The obvious recommendations are try rebooting etc. If you go into iTunes can you access any podcasts from navigating through rather than from the iPod app? 

A: I'm having the same issue with TWiT and This Week In Tech.  When I try Tekzilla, I can download in some formats (HD M4a) but other formats (QT small or QT Large) just show the logo with no episodes to download.  Sounds like Server side issues.
