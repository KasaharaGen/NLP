Q: iCal & me.com file error (Snow Leopard) Every day I get a couple of error messages on my Mac Pro iCal, presumably from Me.com, saying that I have a calendar file waiting. I click on OK, and then I always get another message, saying that iCal cannot read the file. It doesn't seem to have an effect on my calendar, but it is annoying to have to go through this every day. Any ideas on what I could check?
