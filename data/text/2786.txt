Q: How to get MacBook Air to automatically connect to company guest network? My company has a guest wifi network for use by non-company issued machines. Since getting my MacBook Air recently, I've wanted to bring it in and use it around the office. 
I can easily connect to the (unsecured) guest wifi network but then the first time I try to access a website I get a login page where I need to use my company userid/password to gain access. This is kind of like it works in a hotel. 
This works fine except if I put my machine to sleep and wake it up again, I need to re-login again. This re-login happens all day long. Very annoying. I'm wondering if I can configure my Mac to automatically login for me. Is there a way of configuring the wireless networking on my Mac to automatically pass my userid/password for when upon connecting?

A: If the login functions through a Webpage, it's probable that the closest you could come is to write a script to fill in the form for you.
If you're lucky, the login form might use a HTML GET request so you could to bookmark the page that logs you in. Pay attention to what redirects occur once you login. If you see something like this:http://example.com?name=fred&pword=qwerty, you can bookmark that and go to it to log in automatically.
This is unlikely, though, because it isn't a very secure choice for your company. The form probably uses a POST request.

A: It is possible to do a POST request using curl from terminal. You need to figure out the key/values pairs that are being passed, and the action url, and then submit to that url.
