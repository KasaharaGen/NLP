Q: Is there any way to change the snooze time for alarms on the iPhone? It seems that the default snooze time for alarms is 9 minutes. Is there any way I can change this setting?

A: There's no obvious way to change the snooze interval for the built-in iOS alarm. However, there are a few free apps available from iTunes App Store that offer this functionality:


*

*Theme Clock Alarm: Snooze timer configuration (up to 60 minutes)

*Alarmed: offer multiple snooze timings - Drop-down panel for easy access to key features, including Nag-Me, snoozing options...

A: An alternative to the alarm app are CalAlarm and Snooze Me. Both apps provide a snooze function.
CalAlarm is an calendar app, while Snooze Me is a calendar app add on.
Both apps let you choose a Snooze interval and Snooze your events.
App store link Snooze Me: http://itunes.apple.com/app/snooze-me/id474192688
App store link CalAlarm: http://itunes.apple.com/app/calendar-alarm/id367803799

A: A primitive work around would be to set two alarms, both with no snooze. Alarm 2 can be set X minutes after Alarm 1.
