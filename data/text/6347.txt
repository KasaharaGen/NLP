Q: Why does iTunes want my Security Code when I have Store Credit? I have $10.00 next to my name in the iTunes screeen.
I click to buy "Surfin Safari" (by the Beach Boys) for $0.99.
I am then asked for the security code on my Credit Card.
Why?
Why can't it just take it from the iTunes gift card I put in?
GRRRRRrrrrrr.... Frustration!

A: Duh!
Just click 'None' for the credit card type.
Not totally intuitive, but I should have figure this out without a question...
