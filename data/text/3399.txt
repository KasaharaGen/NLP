Q: Why is SSH forwarding happening even with port forwarding disabled? I am using an Aiport Extreme as my wireless router, and it has port forwarding set up but disabled for SSH:


However, I keep seeing instances of ssh login attempts from outside -- someone is trying to access my computer using a series of user names. Moreover, I can still log in from outside my home network using SSH, so I know it's open to the world.
How is this happening? How do I stop it?
Edit
Here is the log for a connection attempt:
==> /var/log/system.log <==

A: I am pretty sure when you select remote log in in the sharing preference pane, OS X opens the port on the router programmatically using NAT-PMP. Have you tried disabling that on the airport and rebooting?

Also be sure you are not editing a profile that is not active on the Airport. I have fallen into that trap once or twice every so often.

A: I would turn off your remote access until you know your home network isn't public so that someone doesn't access it besides you.

A: I am not familiar with the Airport Extreme admin but it looks like you have SSH remote login turned off in the first dialog, and then in the second dialog add it manually mapping external port 22 to internal ip 191.168.1.10 port 22. What you are seeing is someone (usually a script kiddie) trying a dictionary attack against your system. 
If you must have ssh access then I would suggest running it on a non standard external port, which you map to the internal address and port 22. On Linux boxes to prevent this type of activity I normally install DenyHosts which seems to have a Mac port available. This monitors the logs of the ssh daemon, and adds the ip of any system that had a configurable number of failed login attempts within a time window to /etc/hosts.deny
