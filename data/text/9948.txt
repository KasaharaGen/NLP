Q: First Generation Macbook Air Firmware Locked I have a first generation Macbook Air, and the firmware is locked.
I tried taking it to an Apple store, and they recommended swapping the Logic Board.
Is there anything I can do to reset the password?

A: I've solved it using MacOS installer. There is 'Firmware password' application in Utilities (top menu). Just use it.
