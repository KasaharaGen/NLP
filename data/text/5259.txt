Q: Can water seep into my laptop through the sides of the trackpad? If I use the my laptop while my hands are (very) wet, will the water get into the insides of the computer through the gaps at the side of the trackpad?

A: Yes - capillary action is strongest in small gaps like the one surrounding the glass trackpad and the unibody frame. That liquid would likely seep and pool on top of the battery.
