Q: Textmate: removing sidebar on the left Is there a way to remove this sidebar from Textmate?


A: From the View menu, select Gutter, and click to uncheck all of the selected view options there, i.e. Foldings, Bookmarks, Line Numbers, and Soft Wrap Indicators. Once all of the above are unchecked, the gutter will disappear.
