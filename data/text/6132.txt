Q: Is there a way to sync Lion's Reading List across two or more Macs? For example: if I add a URL to the Reading List on my iMac, can it then be synced to the Reading List on my MacBook? It does not appear so even though I believe Reading List is going to sync with iOS 5 devices? (if it is not officially supported, is there a hack to do so)?

A: Syncing between all macs, pcs and iOS devices will be possible when iCloud is released to the public along with iOS 5.
