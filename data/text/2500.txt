Q: Canon Selphy CP780 Printer for MacBook Air Where can I find information on set up?

A: Perhaps you should try the GutenPrint print drivers. These open source drivers work for a huge number of printers, the Selphy CP770 and 790 are listed as supported so either of those might work.
The drivers work with all versions of OS X.

A: Apple's Mac 101 guides for installing a printer: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, or earlier versions.
Canon's extra drivers (you probably don't need them, but install if you have a problem).
Hope this helps. If you have a specific problem, please post with more details.
