Q: Can't see bootcamp anymore after OS X install My mac pro (first gen) previously had a whole disc dedicated to Windows/bootcamp. I've now added a new disk to the machine. On this new disk I have installed OS X 10.6.
Now when I boot the machine, it loads straight into OS X without offering me the Windows option. Help?
