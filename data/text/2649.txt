Q: 3ds Max alternative for Mac Is there a good alternative to Autodesk's 3D modeling software 3ds Max that works on a Mac? 
I like 3ds Max because it's very powerful and easy to use for someone who is not an expert in 3D modeling.
I tried Blender, but it was really hard to understand and control, and I found its commands to be very counter-intuitive.

A: Autodesk's Maya has a Mac version.
I can't say I've used it, but it's quite popular.

A: It's not as feature-laden as 3DS Max, but like Blender, Art of Illusion is free and cross-platform, so it can't hurt to have a look.

A: I was always a big, big fan of Carrara back when I was working with 3D software, and it looks as though the non-Pro version still packs a lot of punch.

A: You can give Cinema4D a try. Personally I find it even easier to understand than 3dsMax.

A: I'd second Maya if you want a professional app that natively runs on a mac. I use it for architectural visualization.
However if you already own a 3DS Max Version why not run it on your mac via Bootcamp or Parallels. Autodesk even supports this kind of usage of their software.

A license of parallels + windows might be cheeper than spending the extra money (and time training) on a new software.

A: You can Use Archicad, is for Architecture but it has a powerful tool called morph that works just fine to me, then you can export the file to 3ds or c4d. You should give a try with that one.
