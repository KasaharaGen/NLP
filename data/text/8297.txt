Q: Built-in card reader in MacBook Pro doesn't work As the title says, the built-in card reader in my MacBook Pro doesn't work. It simply doesn't do anything when I instert an SD card. I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.8.
I guess one of the issues might be Parallels. I have it installed, but it's not running. In the properties of Parallels I've set that all USB devices should be loaded in Mac.
