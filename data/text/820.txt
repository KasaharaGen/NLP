Q: Password keeper for iPhone, Mac and Windows? Are there any (preferably free/cheap) solutions for syncing and accessing encrypted passwords on a Mac, a PC and an iPhone?

A: http://lastpass.com
Runs on virtually anything, and has awesome security. Not the prettiest, but the best features for the price.

A: I use KeePassX, which does the job, although it isn't as polished as 1Password the price is right. It does also work pretty well storing the file in DropBox and accessing the same file from KeePass for windows.

A: I've used http://supergenpass.com/, it's a bit different than the other solutions but it works well.

A: 1Password
It's great and syncs on the iOS platform, and has a beta for Windows too now. :)

A: I've used PasswordWallet to synchronize my Mac with my mobile device -- first a Palm Pilot, then the Treo, now the iPhone.  Very nice, I couldn't manage without it.
