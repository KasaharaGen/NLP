Q: Where can I find this old app: Biorhythms by Andrew Regan The most recent version if possible. Maybe you have it ?
The developer's site has disappeared, here's the MacUpdate page.

A: You can download it right from MacUpdate, can't you?

A: You can also use The Wayback Machine. I've used it on numerous occasion to download something that doesn't exist anymore.
