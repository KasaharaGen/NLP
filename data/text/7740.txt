Q: Can't eject Windows 7 install disk to get drivers from Snow Leopard Install Disk Alright.  I'm angry at this.
I'm on a 2008 Macbook Pro, running snow leopard trying to install windows 7.
During the "find drivers" phase still in mac, it can't.
So according to apple I'm supposed to continue on anyways and use my snow leopard install disk to install the drivers.  But once I am installing windows 7, there is no way to eject disks because I don't have drivers installed yet.
How am I supposed to get around this?

A: Turn the machine off.  Turn it on again, and hold down the trackpad button. The disc should eject.

Restart and hold down the mouse or trackpad button until the disc ejects.

(The other suggestions don't apply; you're not in MacOSX yet, you don't have an eject hole, and you have an Intel machine so the firmware thing won't work.)
The other Apple support page is here:-

A: You should be able to eject the CD in Windows:


*

*Click the Start menu & choose Computer

*Bring up the context menu for the CD by either right-clicking it or selecting (but not opening it) it then pressing Shift+F10

*There should be an option to eject the CD in the context menu
You could try downloading and installing the Boot Camp Update 3.3 while booted in Windows. This update should install the Boot Camp drivers even if no previous version of the drivers have been installed yet.
If those don't work, you can hold the mouse button down after turning on the Mac, or you can startup in OS X to eject the CD, then reboot into Windows. Hold Option down at startup to choose whether to boot OS X or Windows.
