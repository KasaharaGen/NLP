Q: Replacing all white spaces with commas in a 46MB text file How long should replacing all white spaces with commas take in my 46MB text file using a simple text editor such as textmate on my Mac?

A: This should be even faster than the sed solution:
tr ' ' , < orig.txt > modified.txt


A: TextMate can sometimes be very slow with big files like this.
I recommend using a command line utility like sed.
sed 's/ /,/g' orig.txt > modified.txt

will do what you need extremely quickly.  Obviously replace the filenames with your actual filenames.
