Q: Cannot compile C code after installing xcode When I installed Xcode on Snow Leopard, gcc was not in my path. I manually added /Developer/bin to get gcc. However, I wrote a simple C program to include stdlib.h and stdio.h and print a string, but I get linker errors. 
I think this is because I don't have my include path configured. Can anyone tell me why this was not done automatically and how I can get my C compiler set up?

A: I think there was a bug in Xcode 4.1 where the command line tools were not installed. I just ran the 4.1.1 delta installer from the App Store and things work just fine.

This should work out of the box with the latest Xcode. Have you made sure you are using the latest gcc / Xcode and not having previous path or binaries installed?

A: Without knowing the build errors, you either are missing a tool or have header issues. In the case of the latter, here is how llvm-gcc issues in geos were overcome: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/463.
