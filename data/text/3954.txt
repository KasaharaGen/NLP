Q: Codebox, or another code library manager? Since I have Papers for all my documents, iTunes for my music/videos I'm only missing a good "code library manager/snippet manager" for all my pieces of code (especially for small projects or test code, as the bigger ones are easy to archives but little piece of code usually get more or less lost).
So I found Code box but there's no trial version available. I looks like it has the features I want, so something like Paper but for code.
My question is: is it worth buying it ? Would you recommend another one I could test first ?

A: You might also consider http://www.mcubedsw.com/software/codecollectorpro.

A: Have you seen Snippets?  It's very comprehensive, easy to use and has a 30 day trial.

A: Try Snipper App. It's a native MacOS snippets manager with modern, lightweight GUI, syntax highlighting, and Markdown support.
