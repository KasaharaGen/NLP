Q: Making it so programs aren't restored after startup from a forced shutdown Whenever I boot up from a forced shutdown (aka holding down the power button), OSX restores all the programs I had open before the forced shutdown. Is there a way to disable this? If my computer turns off for whatever reason, I want it to boot up fresh.

A: Log out once and uncheck the Reopen windows when logging back in toggle.
It should stick and cover you next time you have to crash land your mac. 
Do be sure to check this setting in the General preference.

Lastly, some more tacky per-app solutions are running around like locking the folders where state is saved. OS X Lion: App-Specific Resume
