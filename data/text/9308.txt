Q: Lion Preview window stuck as always on top After accidentally pressing some wrong keys, it seems my Preview window is stuck in 'Always on Top' mode.  I can't figure out how to undo this.  Is anyone aware of what might have happened?
edit: Well I just closed the document and re-opened it, and it seems to be behaving normally now.  Still curious as to what happened though.

A: This happens to me in Lion as well, but only with big PDFs. Closing and reopening fixes it.
