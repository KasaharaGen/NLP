Q: Is there a way to reopen last windows when you launch TextMate in Lion? I know TextMate isn't Lion optimised, but is there any way to do this?

A: As mentioned in the troubleshooting section you can achieve this by entering the following into your Terminal.app:
defaults write com.macromates.textmate NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool NO


A: The latest build of TextMate 2 does this!
