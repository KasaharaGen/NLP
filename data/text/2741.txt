Q: What's a good Mac app for making timelines (Gantt charts)? What's a good native Mac app for making timelines on Macs? I'm looking for an easy-to-use program that I can use to create timelines easily without delving into graphics programs like Illustrator. (Which I can use, but would be quite time consuming.)

A: Merlin is a fairly user-friendly tool for making Gantt charts. It's commercial software, so it is going to set you back. The interface is a clean "Mac" interface.
OpenProj is another possibility, and it is free.

A: Bee Docs Timelines might suit your needs. The marketing is towards the 3D functionality, but I've had good results generating 2D timelines. Doesn't do Gantt charts, though.

A: Revised because of edited question...
OmniPlan can create very nice looking Gantt charts and timelines out of project plan data. It is a full-on project planning tool, which might be overkill. But the output is quite lovely.

A: I've been looking for a replacement for MS Project for a long time. I haven't found an acceptable native app on the Mac that works well enough and opens/saves Microsoft Project files. The best i've found up to now is Gantter, which is web based and integrates with Google Docs. Surprisingly good.
For serious Gantt charts, nothing beats Microsoft Project, so i often end up running that in a virtual machine (Parallels) on my Mac. Oh the pain!

A: Project Libre is the closest to MS Project.  Actually nothing is really close to MS Project.  But as a MS Project user, I find Project Libre file compatible and quick to use.

A: I've been using TikiToki for a while and it is good for graphical timelines.  It has a Web App and desktop app.  There's a trial here.  And the web app is here: http://www.tiki-toki.com
Another option is http://www.scribblecode.com Aeon Timeline which I have used the demo of and found good but haven't purchased yet.
