Q: Where does Lion's autosave feature save past versions? I just plugged in a USB stick, edited a text file a few times, and found that I could browse through the revision history of the file, even though it's on an external drive. Are these revisions saved on the USB stick? Where exactly?

A: There are a couple SQLite databases located in a hidden folder on the root of your hard drive that are tasked with tracking the files and the differences between the versions.
The directory is:


*

*/.DocumentRevisions-V100


The two databases are:


*

*/.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1/db.sqlite

*/.DocumentRevisions-V100/.cs/ChunkStoreDatabase
