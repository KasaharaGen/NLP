Q: iTunes U showing up in song list Iâ€™ve just started using iTunes U on my iPhone 3G running iOS 3. For some reason, they are all mixed up in my songs on my iPhone, rather than another section such as podcasts which would be far more logical.
In iTunes, they appear in the iTunes U section. Is this meant to happen? If not, how can I fix it?

A: Changing the "Media Kind" to "iTunes U" under the Options tab of the "Get Info" dialog will move them from the Music section of your library to the "iTunes U" section. 
This tends to happen when you import/rip audio files (audiobooks, podcasts, iTunes U, etc.) to iTunes rather than subscribing to them or buying them through the iTunes interface.

A: I think this answer may apply to your problem as well.
