Q: Is a refurbished Macbook Pro's battery new? When you buy a refurbished Macbook direct from Apple, is the battery in it new? I cannot seem to find a definitive answer on their website or on the internet. I am concerned that the savings from buying a refurb will be cancelled out by having to replace the battery in less than a year.

A: I called Apple's Sale Support, and I asked them what their policy was for batteries in a refurbished Macbook. Their answer is that the battery will be replaced if it has a defect, but if nothing is wrong with it, then the laptop will include the original battery which may or may not have many used cycles.

A: This is not answering your question, merely providing a data point, but my refurbished MacBook Air (purchased very late December 2011) currently has a single cycle on its battery. I didn't check the machine when it came out the box, but I'd imagine it was probably at zero cycles when I received it (as I've probably put that cycle on it myself in the month I've had it).

A: mine had 3 cycles when i received it. currently at 7% life left and have not yet charged it since I got it.

A: I just received a refurbished 2015 MacBook Pro today (April 20, 2017) and the power cycles shows 0.  The product also looks brand new.
I have bought several refurbished iPads before, and the same thing.
I would guess the only way Apple leaves the original battery in there is if it had a relatively low power cycle count.  Apple wants you to buy the refurbished products from them.  And I stand by it.  Every refurbished product I have bought through them looks brand new.  Well worth it!

A: I was told by an Apple employee (not a store employee) that most refurb computers are just returns and open boxes, and not computers that were actually used by anyway.
