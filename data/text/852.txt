Q: How can I get Preview to open up in the Foreground? Here's what's currently happening:
I use Chrome. I go to some website that has a PDF that I want to view on a hyperlink. I don't like viewing PDFs in the browser (even though I know this is possible), but prefer to have the pdf download and be viewed in Preview.
When I click the link in Chrome it asks me where I want the file saved, and then it downloads it. I click on the completed download tab at the bottom of the screen, and Chrome remains in the foreground. I can see that Preview has indeed been opened and the PDF is viewable, but I have to switch to Preview to view it using expose or command-tab.
Once the document has been opened in Preview and even when Preview is quit out of, it will always open Preview up in the foreground. This only happens on the first instance of opening a document. Also, if Preview is already open (in fore or background) downloading a new document will bring it to the foreground. So, what's happening only happens when a new document is downloaded and preview is not executed.
Here's what I would like to have happen:
I want to click on the completed download in the Chrome download bar at the bottom, and have it open and Preview and application-switch directly to Preview so that Preview is the foreground active application. This happens when I open other file types, but does not happen with PDFs into Preview. 
My question:
Is there a way to change this behavior? Is there a central place where I can change the default behavior of whether apps open in the foreground or background?

A: Auto-opening a downloaded file from a browser is done on pretty much a browser-to-browser basis. Since you asked about Chrome, here's the relevant blurb from Google's Docs: 

Automatically open certain types of
  files
If you want certain types of files to
  always open after they're done
  downloading, click the arrow next to
  the file button in the downloads bar
  and select Always open files of this
  type. To prevent potentially malicious
  files from automatically downloading
  to your computer, this option isn't
  available for executable filetypes,
  such as those with .exe, .dll, or .bat
  extensions (for Windows), and .dmg
  extensions (for Mac).

Personally, these features weren't visible when I tried it, but then I hardly use Chrome other than for the odd web site test.
