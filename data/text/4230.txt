Q: Couldn't locate MessageTracer database (at path /var/log/DiagnosticMessages) Whenever I open "About this Mac" > "More Info..." and navigate to logs there is an entry with the following content. Any idea what I can do about it?

/usr/bin/pmset -g log:
Description: Power Management logs
Size:    77 bytes
Last Modified:   5/19/11 11:26 PM
Recent Contents: Couldn't locate MessageTracer database (at path /var/log/DiagnosticMessages)

I am on a MBP with OS X 10.6.7
TIA
