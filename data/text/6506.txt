Q: What is EFI in partition scheme? Recently I changed my partition scheme from MBR to GPT, and during after conversion I saw a another partition named EFI ... I don't have a good idea what does it do or its purpose ... but I think it's use for backup's.
So my question here is can you explain/tell me about EFI and it purpose?

On Appleâ€“Intel architecture Macintosh computers, the EFI partition is initially blank and not used for booting. However, the EFI partition is used as a staging area for firmware updates;
