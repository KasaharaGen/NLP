Q: Report a problem with an app I purchased on the Mac App Store I have purchased an app on the Mac App Store which doesn't work at all on my computer. Is there a way to contact the App Store team and report the problem and maybe get a refund?

A: Apple will give refunds, though it’s not a very advertised thing.
Point your browser at the Mac App Store Support Page, which can also be found in the right side bar of the Featured page in App Store.app. From there choose Account & Billing. From the Specific Request select menu, This app didn't function as expected should be the option you’re after.
Be polite, state your case, ask nicely (don’t demand a refund), and you should have good luck.

A: Apple has updated the process to ask for a refund or report a problem. Simply go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com/. Sign-in with your Apple ID and choose the app to report. You can also find the link at the bottom of the iTunes receipt you receive after purchasing an app.
