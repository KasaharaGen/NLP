Q: Is there a replacement for Rosetta in Lion? I have a few PowerPC Mac binaries I would like to run under MacOSX 10.7.
I guess Rosetta is not going to be Open Source, isn't it? Any petition about this? I would start one or contact someone at Apple about this if I would know whom or where.
Can Rosetta be downloaded somewhere or copied over from an 10.6 and made working on 10.7?
Then I thought about user the userspace QEMU emulation. This would be the same thing as what Rosetta was doing (right?). However, from here, it says

  
*
  
*target PowerPC on x86: Not working as the ppc commpage canâ€™t be mapped (yet!)
  

I'm not sure what that means. I would like to work on this if this isn't too hard but not sure where to start. (Btw., because of this, maybe this question is better suited for Stackoverflow?)
Here is a mail from the mailinglist (from 2007) with some more information (not much though).
What are other possibilities?

A: I know it sucks, but really you might just need to drop the PPC stuff (Apple isn't going to support it at all in the future) or look into trying to get the source code and recompiling it yourself.

A: At this point, the open source PPC Mac emulator Sheepshaver may be your best bet.

A: Install Snow Leopard (and Rosetta) in Parallels 7 in Lion.  Installation guide here:
