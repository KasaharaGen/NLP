Q: How to define the VPN PPTP port in OSX Lion? Is there any change to set the port to use when connecting to a PPTP VPN from a Mac?
I configured a VPN at home from Server 2008 so I can access my home server and use ports like RDP, VNC, IMAPS (Gmail), ..., that are blocked.
The problem is that port 1723 is also blocked. So I configured my home router to accept requests on port 443 (HTTPS) and forward it to port 1723 of the VPN Server.
Can I tell the OSX to use port 443 instead of 1723 for that VPN connection?
Thanks!

A: Unfortunately, it is not possible to change OS X's built-in PPTP client's port. However, you can use a third-party client such as OpenVPN. OpenVPN has many more options and will allow you to specify the port with which to connect to the server.
Good luck and happy tunneling!
