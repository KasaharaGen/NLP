Q: Is there any app to monitor how long has each app been actively used? What I'm looking for is basically some monitoring application, which will log how long has each of my applications been actively used. By that I mean it got focus.
The point of this would be to monitor the workflow and to see where do I spend most time.

A: I believe RescueTime will do this. It will also break down your browser usage by site, which is useful too.

A: I've used Active Timer for this in the past.  Wakoopa will do it as well, but you can't get a very detailed breakdown.
