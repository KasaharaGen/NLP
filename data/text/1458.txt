Q: How can I change the keyboard shortcut key to open Quicksilver? Fyi.. I searched Apple.SE and didn't found an answer, so I am posting here.
Currently I open Quicksilver by Ctrl + Shift + spacebar. And my Spotlight preference is Cmd + spacebar.
Most of the time I use Quicksilver, I would like to change this. I know how to change this for spotlight, but not sure for QS.

UPDATE:
Now I am able to see the preferences screen with some menu's and here is the screenshot. Am I running very old build/ version ?


A: Open QuickSilver, and press ⌘+, to access Preferences.
Go to the Command tab and change HotKey Actionvation to the shortcut you want to use.
If the command you want to set is the same as the Spotlight one, you'll first have to change the Spotlight shortcut.


A: I would try upgrading your version.  Mine is currently at ß58 (3841).
If after upgrading you're still having issues, I would remove the app and all related files/folders and reinstall.
