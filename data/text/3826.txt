Q: Is there a limit to how many iOS devices I can synch with iTunes? I've heard about the 5 computer limit.
I'm wondering if iOS devices are included in that or not.

A: There is no limit to how many iOS devices you can sync with iTunes.  
The 5 computer limit is how many computers you can have authorized simultaneously with iTunes.

A: I'm pretty sure this has changed now.  Apple updated their policy in August '11.

A: I've had no issues syncing 300 devices with one library.
Other than disk space to track the backups of each device, your time and money, I don't think there is any pre-defined limit.

A: No, iTunes has no limitations for iOS devices. You can use as many devices to sync you want.
