Q: Continuing pages in Page Layout Document in Pages I have a Page Layout document in Pages currently. Is there a way to convert part of the document into "word processing" mode where when you run out of room on one page, it automatically creates a new page?

A: Someone has to give you the bad news: 
You can't. You have to copy/paste and re-edit again in the other mode. When you create a new pages document, you have to wisely chose the one that suits you best. You canâ€™t go back and forth between them nor mix the types in the same document. 
Sad but true. ;)
