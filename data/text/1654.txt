Q: Why is Firefox randomly reopening itself after quitting? I've had a strange problem that's been bugging me for awhile.  It seems that every couple times I quit Firefox, it will reopen itself automatically.  Basically:


*

*I'll hit cmdq

*Firefox will shut down

*the little 'open' light underneath its icon in the dock will disappear

*suddenly the FF icon will start bouncing and it will open back up


Usually when this happens, my previous session will appear to be loading but all the tabs will stay blank.  However, this is not always the case, sometimes my tabs will load.  Another thing I just noticed is that after it reopens, Firefox is 'hidden' (like when you click 'Hide Firefox' from the main menu) until I click on it.  
If I quit FF a second time, it stays closed.  The next time I open FF, my original session will be restored and everything works normally.
This has happened on two different Macs for me, and my wife has occasionally seen this behavior as well.  Any ideas on what might be happening, and has anyone else had this happen?

A: I had the same problem ! I downloaded version 3.5 for mac & it works fine for me now.
Please Take Note of following.
Even in FireFox version 3.5, I faced a strange behavior.
When I try to open a new tab sometimes it goes adding new tabs in bulk, I mean infinite loop of adding new tab. In that case, I used to quit fireFox by force. ( force-Quit ).
It happens quite frequently, even though I couldn't determine the exact steps to produce that bug. So, If you face same kind of behavior, please let me know by comments.
