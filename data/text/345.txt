Q: un-sync iPhone and iPod Touch I bought an iPod touch first. I registered it with iTunes, gave it a name, etc. All was well, it synced when I connected it, made backups, etc.
Eventually I got an iPhone. I didn't need to register it with iTunes, it found my iPod touch data somehow. I don't think it ever asked me to give it a name. And the most annoying part, is that it syncs all the apps I put on the iPod Touch with the iPhone, and vice-versa.
How do I separate these two devices?

A: If the two devices are named the same it will backup/restore the same items. My recommendation is to rename one of your devices and a new profile will be created for it.
