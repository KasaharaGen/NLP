Q: Use finder to connect to IIS ftp server I would like to be able to use Finder to connect via (read-only) FTP to a IIS file server. However, I need to log in using the pattern domain\username. I've tried all the combinations I can think of to get this to work (domain\username, domain\\username, domain%5cusername) and none of them work. I have no problem connecting with the command line ftp client (though it's quirky), or any graphical clients. Has anyone been able to get this working for themselves?

A: On a Mac I've actually had some trouble with FileZilla as Chris mentioned.
I personally prefer Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.ch/) which has worked very well for me. Especially in cases where Finder could not handle things like:
ftp://siteaddress|user@logindomain


A: The best thing I've found is to use FileZilla. It's a free FTP program.
Domain\username is the best way to log in.
Just make sure to have the right settings when connecting to server.
IIS's FTP is kinda quriky sometimes, make sure you know what your doing, and try it on a windows client too!

A: Answering my own question: In the end, I don't think it's possible. You have to use a third-party FTP client to pass domain information. That is extremely sad.
