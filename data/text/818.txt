Q: First iPhone, what should I Do? So, I've decided to go for an iPhone 4. But since I am new to the whole iPhone thing, what are the things that I should know, to make the maximum use of the device?
Some of the questions I would like to know the answer:


*

*what are the apps I should install? 

*How do I charge the battery? 

*The temperature the iPhone should be exposed to in order to prolong the lifespan?


A: 1) That entirely depends on what you want to do. There are a bunch of app recommendation discussions here based around games, productivity, etc. Rather than rehash them, I'd suggest searching those out.
2) Plug it into a USB port on your computer. The phone also comes with a wall adapter for the USB cable so you can charge it from a wall socket.
3) Don't stick it in the oven or the freezer and you should be fine.

A: Apple has a handy "iPhone Temperate Zone" chart on their iPhone battery page.
As for what apps to install: the reason apps are user-installable is because everybody wants different ones!  But also, if you're in Malaysia, you probably have a different selection of available apps in your App Store from most other users here, anyway.
