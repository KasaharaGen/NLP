Q: How can I share a Cisco VPN connection? I am using ICS on my Early 2011 MBP (latest version of Snow Leopard) to share a connection to various devices, e.g. XBOX.
Normally this is by manually configuring the network settings on the client, and connecting to the MBP via Ethernet.
I can share the Airport connection wifi fine, but when I connect to a VPN using Cisco client it does not work. The Cisco adapter seems to be hidden when trying to select it as a source option for ICS.
Any possibility to recreate the Cisco connection using Native mac client?

A: I don't know if this option was also available in Snow Leopard, but if you are on Lion you could try the following:


*

*Set up the native cisco client - if you don't know how, you can use this handy guide I created a few days back

*Once you have tried and confirmed that everything works, your VPN connection should show up as one of the options in the Internet Sharing part of Preferences Sharing.

*select the connection, choose on which network connection you'd like to share it and you're done.
