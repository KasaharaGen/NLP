Q: Can I install mac mini and wireless keyboard/mouse without USB keyboard/mouse? I want to buy mac mini.
But I do not want have USB keyboard/mouse, which will not be used after installing them because I will use wireless keyboard/mouse.
Can I install or reinstall mac os and install wireless keyboard/mouse without USB mouse/keyboard?

it is acceptable for me to have only a usb mouse because it is small.
if there are no ways to install os and wireless mouse/keyboard without USB mouse/keyboard,ã€€are threre ways to install them with only a USB mouse?


A: you have to buy a usb bluetooth, mac mini comes with no Bluetooth module installed! If your not it you have to buy the usb stick! Once this is done you can assign the keyboard and mouse to the mac mini! ;)
