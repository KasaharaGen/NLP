Q: Can't gain write access to secondary hard drive root-level folder I have a second hard drive installed on my Mac. On its several root-level folders there's only one I can't get write access to.
I've tried right-clicking it, select "Get Info", unlock it, click the plus sign, select my name, change my name, & everyone to "Read only to "Read & Write", click the gear icon, "Make Me the owner" & "Apply to enclosed items." 
Even after repeating those steps I still can't rename or delete this folder. How can I gain write access to it? 

A: Do you need permissions to exist on this volume?  If not use the "Ignore permissions on this volume" checkbox, and that will take care of all of the problems.
Also - I would run disk utility's verify to see if there are any problems with it.
