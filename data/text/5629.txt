Q: I'm looking for a good, lightweight email client I'm looking for a good, lightweight email client.
What do you guys recommend?

A: Apple Mail. Nothing is as integrated into the OS as apple's own mail. Works seamlessly with Gmail

A: Popular email clients for the Mac include:


*

*Apple Mail - my current favourite, especially in Lion.

*Postbox - Paid for, but feature-rich and quite polished AFAICT

*Thunderbird Free and open-source. Extremely configurable with a similar extension ecosystem as Firefox.

*Microsoft Outlook - A very fully featured email and calendar package. It replaces Microsoft's previous Mac email client, Entourage.

*Sparrow - A unique email application. The layout encourages casual, Twitter-like conversation by evoking the timeline view of popular Twitter apps. It's pretty trendy at time of writing.

*Mailplane - Basically an optimised, dedicated Gmail browser window. Worth looking into if you're a heavy Gmail webmail user.

*MailMate - I hadn't heard of this one before, but it has a good review at Lifehacker.


A: Try Sparrow, you can try the free version and if you like it, buy it.
