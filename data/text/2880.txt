Q: Is there a beginners guide to Unix from the OS X point of view? I'm hoping to build on my embarrassingly-limited knowledge of the command line, and I know there are a ton of great resources out there. I'm wondering if there are any books or other resources that are tailored specifically to the OS X user running Terminal.
Thanks.

A: Well, there is always Apple´s official command line guide but back when I learned my way around the Terminal, I found Unix for the beginning Mage (PDF, free) quite entertaining and educational (given it suits your humour). 
If you´d rather go for a book, I´d highly recommend "The Mac OS X Command Line: Unix Under the Hood".

A: This Mac OS X Unix Tutorial has a lot of information in there which you could start from. All in all, I think that if you start up with any of the good resources on Linux (or Unix), you should be able to get up to speed with most aspects of Unix on OS X. 

A: O'Reilly has several Learning UNIX for Mac OS X books. They were all published several years ago, and the most recent one is for Tiger. But they are still relevant to UNIX, as one of the great things about UNIX is that the fundamentals are quite stable. 

A: I'm a fan of Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal, by Joe Kissell. It's a $10 ebook that is specifically designed for beginning command line users on Mac OS X. I think it's exactly what you asked for. I find many O'Reilly UNIX books to be frustratingly opaque for the beginner.
Book blurb from the above link:

If you've ever thought you should
  learn how to use the Unix command line
  that underlies Mac OS X, or felt at
  sea when typing commands into
  Terminal, Joe Kissell is here to help!
  This 111-page ebook will help you
  become comfortable working on the
  Mac's command line, starting with the
  fundamentals and walking you through
  more advanced topics as your knowledge
  increases. And if you're uncertain how
  to put your new-found skills to use,
  Joe includes numerous real-life
  "recipes" for tasks that are best done
  from the command line.

Disclaimer: Though I wrote a Take Control book seven years ago, I have no financial interest in Joe's book.
