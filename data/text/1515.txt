Q: RSS feed for new AppleTv titles? Is there perhaps an RSS feed or some other method of being notified of new AppleTv titles as they become available?

A: There should be, but almost all I found were people complaining that there wasn't one.
Given that, one or more of these might help:


*

*Apple TV Junkie has a feed of at least some new movies.

*Apple has an iTunes RSS Generator
While it doesn't do new movies, it will give you top movies and top movie rentals.

*If you felt like getting into the code, here's the  iTunes search API.

*This URL launches iTunes and goes directly to the "New Movies to Rent or Own" section of the iTunes store.
