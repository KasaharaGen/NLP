Q: Taglocity "Clone" For Mac Outlook 2011? I'm a huge user of Taglocity on Windows (Outlook 2010).  Being a recent convert to a Mac, I'm very interested in using the Outlook app from Mac Office 2011.  However, I can't get by without some at least basic functionality that I depend on from Talocity, which is Windows-only.
The most important feature is the ability to automatically keyword tag emails as they are sent and received and to have those tags follow emails that are subsequently sent/received in that thread.
Workflow is typically something like this --


*

*I receive an email.  Take a look at it and manually tag it with the "Widget" and "Red" keywords.

*I reply/forward that email and my response is automatically tagged with the same keywords.

*A new email arrives from the same thread.  It is automatically tagged.

*Rinse, repeat...


A simple keyword search/filter mechanism is needed as well.
Any ideas?  Thanks.
