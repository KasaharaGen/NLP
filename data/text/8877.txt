Q: iPhone 4 cannot restore to iOS 5 in DFU mode I download the iOS 5 firmware file for my iPhone 4 (GSM): iPhone3,1_5.0_9A334_Restore.ipsw. I put my iPhone in DFU mode and Alt+Clicked the Restore button in iTunes. I then selected the .ipsw that I downloaded and then it extracts the software and gives me the following message:

I just can't seem to upgrade the phone, any ideas anyone?

A: As iOS 5 is public, there is no need to download the firmware file yourself. Just click on 'search for updates' and let it upgrade.
