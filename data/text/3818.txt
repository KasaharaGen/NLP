Q: Can I get (something like) an Apple wireless keyboard with numeric keypad? That would be perfect; their current wireless keyboard is too laptop-like. I like having wide arrow keys, the delete/end/page up/page down/home keys.
Otherwise, can someone recommend a similar option?

A: Agree with Lo√Øc that this question should be rephrased, but if you're looking for a possible solution without being subject to Apple's whims, there are many third-party bluetooth keypads available...

*LMP Bluetooth Keypad -- meant to attach to an Apple wireless keyboard, but has mixed reviews

*Microsoft Bluetooth Keypad -- blasphemy, I know, but it has good reviews

*Logitech Wireless Keypad -- non-Bluetooth alternative that uses Logitech's mini USB receiver


A: Apple made a "normal" style wireless keyboard a few years ago. They are still available second hand.  Search for "apple wireless keyboard A1016"

A: Speculating on when Apple will release something is pointless, but here's a nice-looking alternative:

A: I have this one. It has the command key instead of the windows key you'll find most of the time.
It's been discontinued but I still see it regularly at the local Futureshop and Best Buy here in Sherbrooke, QC Canada.
