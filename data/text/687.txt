Q: Mail: Separate unread counts (badges) on dock icon for different accounts I have multiple accounts configured in Mail and I would like to see the separate unread counts in the dock icon.
I was looking at dockstar. When I google I see that another plugin Mailbadger is also available (the homepage is down for quite sometime now, and the download available via macupdate and others seem to be outdated)
Is there another/better app/plugin for customizing Mail's dock icons?

A: For all the software I searched and see the detailed specs, Dockstar is the best choice for the feature you are requesting.
