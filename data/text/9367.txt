Q: How do I create a new user in Lion from the Terminal? The older method of:
dscl . -create /Users/username

doesn't work because /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist can't be found. From what I gather, OSX Lion doesn't use this method anymore.
How can I create a new user solely from the Terminal?

A: They renamed the Directory Services daemon in Lion:
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist
