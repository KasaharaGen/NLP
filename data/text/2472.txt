Q: RSS reader with Instapaper or Readability integration? One of my main information stream inputs is RSS feeds. Yet many link to long articles on strangely designed web pages, so I regularly read using Instapaper, or Readability.
Is there a RSS reader with built-in integration with Instapaper?
I want to quickly scan lots of feeds, and hit one button to send to Instapaper. Yes I know that I could use Google Reader, on a browser, with the Instapaper extension installed. 
I find the web interface of google hard to scan quickly, and I would prefer an offline RSS reader.
thanks

A: NetNewsWire integrates with Instapaper and also syncs with Google Reader.

A: Reeder (for both the iPhone and Mac OS) can send articles to Instapaper.

A: My favourite, Feedler, although only the Pro (paid) version supports Instapaper.

A: There are LOTS of them. My favorites are:
River of News for iPad - $3.99.
MobileRSS for iPad/iPhone/iPod - Free/Paid versions.
Reeder for Mac - Free for now while in beta.
If you use Safari, PureReader extension makes Google Reader webapp SOOO much nicer.
By the way, you didn't say which platform you're using.

A: I'm currently using Gruml, a slightly clunky but useful RSS reader for the Mac. It seems to support a lot of services, including Instapaper. It is also a beta and slightly buggy.
