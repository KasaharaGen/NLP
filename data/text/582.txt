Q: Should I use MaxiVista or Air Display for a Windows 7 monitor extender? I'm about to go on a trip and I'm wondering if anyone has tried both MaxiVista and Air Display as monitor extenders for Win7. MaxiVista was first on a PC and Air Display is still in beta for PC. 

A: I use Maxivista and have no problems. I use it on my Windows boxes for a very long time and it just works as promised.

A: Balexandre: The Maxivista App does not cost $40, it cost $9.99.
MaxiVista is awesome. I never thought that a monitor can be that fast over W-LAN.

A: I've used both.
Air Display is better at updating the iPad display quickly and smoothly.  Air Display also has some additional features, like being able to use the touchscreen as a mouse, and it can be used with both Windows and Mac, so I'd say it is a better deal.
Maxivista is a little easier to get set up on Windows.  It just worked.  I had to futz around a bit to get Air Display to work, but it wasn't too hard (just have to remember to Run as Administrator).
For more details on what I found when I compared them, see my blog.

A: if you only use windows, then you should go buying MaxiVista as it's stable and works great.
Air Display was firstly for iPad as a extra monitor, and they are now doing the Windows part witch can take time.
But there again... the Air Display beta is free while MaxiVista costs 40 bucks (or $100 is you want mirroring and high res)  
:o)
my recommendation: try Air Display for free :)
