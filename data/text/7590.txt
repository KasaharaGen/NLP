Q: Creating a wifi hotspot on OSX with a connected USB wifi adapter instead of airport (OSX Lion) I am using a USB wifi adapter on my Lion imac.  I am trying to use that connection to create a working wifi hot spot with the imac's internal airport. 
I tried following these instructions:

It didn't work, though. It feels like i need to do one more step to get the connection bridged between the usb adapter and the airport. 
Thanks,

A: I think this will only work on wifi adaptors that support bridged mode wireless. Not all of them do. The internal Airport does which is why it can be turned into a hotspot. 
I think you'll be able to go this way
Share your connection from : [usb wifi adaptor] 
To Computers using : [airport] 

Setting up all security features as per normal.
