Q: Using timed access control in airport extreme base station I have an airport base station model A1354. I am attempting to setup MAC Timed Access so a laptop can only connect between 5:00AM and 11:00pm through the Airport Utility version 5.5.2 (552.11). My AEBS is running firmware version 7.5.2
When I try to enter the time values by double clicking over the time and entering 05:00 AM and 11:00PM the time values don't stay as soon as it looses focus. Instead they become what is in the following screenshot, and the laptop looses connectivity as soon as I update the base station. I also tried entering the values in military time with the same result. 

Here is the requested screenshot:


A: When you've altered the times, click the '+' button so a second line appears, then click 'Done'.  

A: Are you typing your times in the following format:
HH:MM  ?
as in, with a space between the time and AM/PM?
I know this sounds like a stupid question, but my AEBS has done some stupid things when I tried to type it without the space (e.g. 12:43PM).
