Q: iPhone custom label in contacts I am having trouble saving a contact with a custom label in iOS4. I received a phone call from a number not stored in my phone. After the call, I clicked the blue chevron next to the number >> Create New Contact >> Entered name info >> click "mobile" >> Add Custom Label >> Entered my label name >> Save   
At this point, the phone number shows up correctly, with the custom tag. When I press Done, it goes back to the "mobile" tag.  
I was able to do this in 3.x. Is this an iOS4 bug?

A: I did this when editing a contact a few days ago. So the functionality is there.
