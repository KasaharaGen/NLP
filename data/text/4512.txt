Q: App to Ensure Healthy Coffee Consumption? If I don't drink enough coffee my brain doesn't function.
If I drink too much coffee, I end up over-percolating my brain.  
Is there an app that will recommend how much coffee you should consume to keep your consumption at the optimal rate, so that your brain functions but doesn't over-function?  
Ideally, the app would go so far as to slide back your coffee consumption so that your body doesn't get used to an amount so that it requires more.

A: so there's an interesting web tool I would recommend: http://chartmyself.com/
You can use it to figure out just how much coffee you're drinking and how much you can get away with not drinking. There are articles on the site to recommend how to not drink too much :)
