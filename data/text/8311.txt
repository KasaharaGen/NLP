Q: iPhone battery life is awful even after replacing it I have an iPhone 3gs 32gb. As they do, my battery was noticeably depleting as well as conflicted with the device having been slightly water damaged (dropped in quickly but immediately turned off and dried out. Works "fine"). I decided to replace the internal battery with a factory OEM version but even after doing so my battery life is awful. I am talking about losing 10% during one 4 minute phone call or 30% in the first hour or less or simple standby. 
Are there things I should look for or perhaps additional parts which could be causing the depletion? 
For reference: I charged the phone to 100%, turned the phone off, then 3 days later (with phone off) the battery was completely dead. Something else seems to be constantly running or draining the battery.

A: It is a common issue for an iPhone to have premature battery life draining, I can't speak to the self replacement, but generally the fastest and best course of action is to follow the steps for syncing your information to a personal information management software(address book, ical, etc) and restoring the device as new.
The step by step instructions are listed in: 
 How to back up your data and set up as a new device
Again just to reiterate, you do not want to restore from a backup in iTunes, but restore the device into a factory default state. If it isn't fixed by that, it's likely a permanent hardware problem.

A: There´s a lot to do when problem is battery not lasting, mostly it´s user´s fault. 5 hints that may double your battery:


*

*close all unused app - You hit home, but app is still running! use an app to free mem and close them up, or close 1 by 1, in multitasking bar;

*set you brightness lower, and smaller time on autolock - Screen leds are one of the items that uses more bat power. with low brightness, lower power consumption;

*only activate 3g when you´re really using it! The same with WiFi, Bluetooth Etc. Using SBSettings makes it even easier (cydia tweak);

*why location turned on 24/7? let it on only when you want to use it!

*full cycle bat once a month - let it drain almost completely, and charge it for at least 8 hours with all apps closed;

*less notifications, or shut it off - notifications also uses a lot of resources, as run in background most of time.
my iphone4 lasts up to 4 days, so I assure it really makes difference!

A: Here are a few tips:


*

*Turn Off Keyboard Clicks Sound

*Disable Background App Refresh

*Turn off the Parallax Effect/Animations

*Turn off Wifi/Bluetooth/Airdrop

*Disable Location Services

*Close Running Apps in the Background

*Remove the App Garbage Files by CleanMyPhone
