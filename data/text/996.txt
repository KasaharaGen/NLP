Q: Is there free software for recognizing a song when it plays? I have few .mp3 file that have no name or have a wrong name(artist name and song name) is there any free software exist to recognized what exactly this song is(by playing the song and this software search their database and find similar signal wave)?
I see some similar app in iphone (if you play song and run this app after some second this app recognize the song)
And I Also use Tunatic in windows and it was a good software but I can't use Tunatic in OS X (Tunatic is available for MAC OS X too)
I know some software exist to tag music like TuneUP and MusicBrainz and ... but I want some thing else. I don't want answer like this one.

A: I'm not sure if you have a smartphone, but Shazam and SoundHound work well by using the phone's mic to identify songs while they're playing.  And I know you said you don't want to use MusicBrainz, but have you tried the scan feature?  It scans the song and tries to identify it based on a musical "fingerprint", not just by metadata.
