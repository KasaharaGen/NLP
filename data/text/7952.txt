Q: Apple screen gets scrambled randomly Recently I upgraded to Lion, since doing this upgrade I am now getting a bug with Safari where the browser window "scrambles". By this, I mean that the entire window breaks up into rectangular blocks say .8cm x 1 - 2cm of different colours etc. Each of these blocks can be a solid or mixture of colours.
I have noticed this happen with the desktop once, and the Finder as well so I'm pretty sure its not just Safari-related, although it happens in Safari ~99% of the time. If I am watching something like YouTube, the video remains ok but all other page content gets scrambled.
To add some background to this I have had this MacBook for 4+ years now and never had any issues like this until I changed to Lion from Snow Leopard.
I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue or heard of it and knows how it can be fixed?
