Q: OS X keeps crashing while compiling I have a fresh install of Snow Leopard on a 32bit Core Duo.
Ever since I installed Snow Leopard, I have random crashes when compiling:
i.e. - during brew install imagemagick. While brew installed dependencies (tiff and little-cms) it finished just fine, but when it went to compile imagemagick itself, it crashes.
During make install for imagemagick, the system fans just spin up then my computer shuts down.  
I've looked at mkmf.log and CrashReporter, but nothing is in them about this install.  
I'm using Xcode is 3.2.6 with iOS SDK 4.3.
Any other log files I can view?  Any ideas?

EDIT - I noticed that this was happening during compiling only.  Also noticed that fans started to spin up before crashes but never got a chance to spin to max speed.  I guess somewhere along the way, either one of my fans went out, or something of the sort.
So I did the following:
I downloaded and installed MenuMeters, then smcFanControl.
I set the Higher RPM in smcFanControl to max.  Right before I started to install apps which needed compiling like imagemagick I turned smcFanControl to max and monitored CPU temp.  So far I've been able to install without crashes, but now I know I need to be replacing my mac soon.

A: Maybe this is a hardware error. Heat or memory related issues?
You should try the hardware test using your Install CD.

A: The most serious issue here is your shut down. We need to see what the cause of this is.
