Q: How can I reset the PRAM if Recovery Mode keeps overriding the PRAM command? Lion uses the ⌘ + R to boot into recovery mode. Resetting the PRAM in anything less than 10.7 was ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R.
Recovery mode now seems to override the PRAM command. Does anyone know if there is a new way to reset the PRAM now that Lion is installed?

A: Nate , PRAM reset is not working because you turn on Password Firmware Protection.
Turn it off and P+R+Option+Command will work.

A: Resetting the PRAM works the same way it always did.  This is a function of the hardware - not the OS.  What makes you think it doesn't work anymore?  (tested on Macbook, Mac Mini).

A: Or she has spilt something on the keyboard and the shift key is telling the computer it's being held down, so no matter what, it will boot into recovery mode. I work for an apple specialist and see it all the time.
