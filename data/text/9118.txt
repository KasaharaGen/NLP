Q: Reinstall Mac App Store on Mac OS 10.7? I accidentally removed the Mac App from my Mac Mini while removing the iTunes 10.5 Beta. How can I reinstall the Mac App Store?

A: Here's the .app file off my machine: http://cl.ly/0f293H081S2e1Y2B3f1r

A: oh, good question. Maybe install a basic Lion system onto an external HD and copy the app from there? Or you don't have a backup like Time Machine or anything similar, do you?
Maybe someone with an identical version of the OS can zip the file and send it to you.
I think that whatever way you wanna do it, copying the app from one Mac to another should work. As long as the OS versions match of course...
