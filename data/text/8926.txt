Q: Network problem isolated to this macbook air, where to look next? Periodically, once or twice a day, I'll start to experience network issues (latency and dropped packets) on this one machine while I'm browsing:



*

*Other machines on the same Linksys WRT54G wireless network continue to function normally

*I've attempted shutting down all running programs that I can identify

*I've attempted disabling and re-enabling the wireless connection and reconnecting to the network


The only thing that seems to fix it is restarting the machine. So that's what I keep doing.
My best guess is I have either have something running on the machine that I haven't identified causing this issue ... or ...?
Very open to any ideas on where to look or what types of things might cause this :)

A: I advise you to download and run iStumbler http://istumbler.net/ on your Mac.
Run it around the place where you want to work and at peek hours
of the day (where your neighbours are also using their Wi-Fi PC and
routers).
This run should give you a clear indication of which channels are
received at a high power level. You should absolutely avoid these
overloaded channels (most probably 1, 6 & 11) and pick a channel which
is either free or received at the lowest signal level where and when you work.
