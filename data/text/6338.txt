Q: Why does my Terminal window close automatically? I need to use my Terminal window on a MacBook Air but it closes about 10 seconds after I open it.  Is there a setting or is it possible another program is causing it to close?  If I type quickly I can run say diskutil but it closes after it runs.

A: If you have a system administrator that has blocked terminal, you should get permission from your system administrator to unblock it.
