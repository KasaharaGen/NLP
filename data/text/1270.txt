Q: Is iOS 4.2 faster than 4.1 (iPod Touch)? I've read that iOS 4.2 is faster on the iPhone 3G -- they're making a big deal out of this.
Is this performance improvement limited to the 3G?  I have an iPod Touch 4gen and I'm wondering if I'll see any difference.
There's no features of iOS 4.2 that interest me, so I wouldn't bother with the upgrade, but if it also gave me improved performance, I might.
Thanks!

A: Having used 4.2 GM on my iPhone 4 for a couple of weeks now I personally find it much much better at managing and minimising memory usage (regular checks using iStat). This should translate to better performance on older devices with limited RAM as less RAM to flash swapping will be required.
