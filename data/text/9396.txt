Q: Unable to log in to open directory account I'm in the process of setting up my Mac Mini with Lion server. Everything appears to be working fine on the server, but I'm having problems logging into any open directory account that has a network share set as the home folder. If I change the users home folder to just a local folder, I can log in fine. I've confirmed my client is correctly connected to the directory server, because if I enter the password incorrectly, I get the password incorrect error.
The error I get when I attempt to log into the account is this, in a message box: "You are unable to log into the user account "testaccount" at this time. Logging in to the account failed because an error occurred."
I can't even log into "testaccount" locally from the server, I get the same error.
Is there some step I'm missing?

A: I happened to solve this, though perhaps not the "right" way. Changing the server to a local server with the address myserver.local instead of myserver.com fixed the issue with me. I then just use a dynamic DNS service to point my domain to my IP. Now everything works correctly and I can login on both the client and the server.
