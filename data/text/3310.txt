Q: Indicates fully charged when not 100% I recently (less than 1 month ago) purchased a new Macbook Pro 13". Love it so far, but have a question on the battery. It never reaches 100% - usually it makes it up to 96% then the light on the charger goes from amber to green, and the charging indicator says "fully charged".
I've tried recalibrating the battery as described here.
Should I just take it to the Apple Store and have someone look at it? Is this a typical behavior?

A: My 17" Macbook Pro battery, is at 95% after 260 cycles!
So this is not normal for such a new battery.
You should go to an Apple Store and probably they will replace it for you!
From Apple website:

The built-in battery of your MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.
