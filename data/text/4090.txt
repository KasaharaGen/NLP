Q: iPhone app which syncs Outlook memos while maintaining categories I am looking for an iPhone app which will synchronise with Microsoft Outlook memos, while maintaining the categories which I have set up in Outlook.  From my understanding, the Notes application which comes bundled in with the iPhone doesn't have any categories.
Any recommendations about an app which will do this for me?

A: It sounds like iMExchange 2 ($8 after trial period) might do the trick for you if you or your company are running an Exchange Server.
