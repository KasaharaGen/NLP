Q: Mac OS X locks up when I plugin in headphones on MacBook Pro Every time I plug in (or off) my headphones (even white iPhone ones), Mac OS X locks up for about 10 seconds, and then works as normal, and even displays the beach ball. Not everything locks up, as I can still switch screens, etc, but I think the Finder does.
Initially I thought this was related to Flash, as the Flash Player would stop working, but this happens even when the browser is closed.
I don't have any audio related apps installed.
Does anybody have any ideas of what could causing this, or tips on how to track down the problem?

A: Could you try creating a new user and see if it happens there? Create a new user. Restart your computer and log with the new user. Make sure you don’t have anything in the “Login Items” (nothing starts at login).
Also try starting your Mac in “Safe Mode” as described here and see how it goes. 
This could be related to a Kernel Extension (ktext) problem.
