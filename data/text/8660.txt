Q: Can OmniGraffle for iOS open and edit PDFs?   OmniGraffle for OS X can open and edit PDFs.  Can OmniGraffle for iOS do this?

A: The OmniGraffle product page for the iOS version mentions that it can export PDFs. They don't seem to mention anywhere whether it will open PDFs, but that seems likely.
