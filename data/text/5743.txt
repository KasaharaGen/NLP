Q: Special keyboard keys I have this applet made in java, which relies on the users keycode input.
The case is that I have to press "Insert" for a function, which doesn't exist on the keyboard. Another function requires the "Page Up", which is also missing from my keyboard.
I have the BT Keyboard (no numpad).
I did not make the applet and there are no options to change the keyboard-controls.
How can I send these 'keys' to the Java applet?

A: The page up Key is mapped to fn + Arrow UP. 
Other key combinations with fn and the arrow keys are:


*

*Arrow down > page down

*Arrow left > beginning of line or begin of page depending on situation

*Arrow right > end of line or bottom of page depending on situation


For the Insert Key there's no correspondant key on a Mac keyboard, but you could try using the fn + Enter which I found here. I can't confirm this though as I absolutely have no idea where I could test this out. 

A: On that keyboard, the Page-Up key code can be sent by pressing:
fn+â†‘
This can be found by turning on the Keyboard Viewer in System Preferences -> Language and Text -> Input Sources.
