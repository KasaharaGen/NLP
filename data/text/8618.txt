Q: How can I force an app to uninstall? I just installed an app that was a waste of my time. The problem is, when I long-pressed the app to delete it, it didn't show an (x).  How can I delete it?  I've looked through the settings.  I'm kind of new to iPods so if this is simple, just say it bluntly.

A: You open up Cydia>Manage and then delete the app. Enjoy!
