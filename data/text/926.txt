Q: Software for Mac OS X to view movies on my PS3 or Xbox 360 I want to see movies that are on my Mac on the screen connected to my PS3 or Xbox 360

A: Nullriver Software: 
Medialink - PS3
Connect360 - Xbox360

A: I use MediaLink, which lets you use your Mac as a server which the PS3 can connect to for music, pictures, and movies.  It seems to work well enough; my only problem is that I don't like the PS3's interface for browsing through large collections of things.  For example, when sharing my entire iTunes library, I'm just about restricted to playlists or random shuffle -- pulling a particular artist/album/song out of thousands is just a pain.  For movies, it's worked just fine for me.

A: I use Rivet for streaming to my PS3. It's completely painless to set up, while I've had trouble with another solution in the past (unfortunately I can't remember the name of that one).

Supposedly works with XBox 360 as well.  Supports streaming and transcoding.

A: I am using Vuze for that: http://www.vuze.com/features/device
Not sure if there are any alternatives for OSX.
