Q: Repairing Mac OS X Leopard without Time Machine I did a dumb thing and accidentally overwrote my copy of /usr/bin/sqlite3 on my Mac OS X 10.5.8. I don't have a Time Machine backup so I can't grab the file from there. When I try to run Apache2, I'm getting the error:
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/sbin/httpd
  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture
/usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture

How can I retrieve or rebuild /usr/bin/sqlite3?
Edit: Before all of this, I ran the 10.5.8 Combo Update in case something on my system was corrupted.

A: Reinstalling the entire Mac OS X is the guaranteed way to ensure all system components are correctly installed.
Sometimes you can get away with running a Combo Updater (the 10.5.8 in your case), it can repair a slightly damaged (or corrupted) installation.
If you are unsure of why things are missing or damaged, better to reinstall or at least run a Repair Permissions in Disk Utility. System files should be protected from deleting and you don't know if other protections are missing or changed.

A: The sqlite version is outdated anyway. I suggest you go over here http://www.sqlite.org/ and download the current client. (Yes Apple is one of the sponsors. they use SQLite a lot for their apps, eg Mail for instance)
If you are looking for the framework, that is only included in the base installation. 
Have a look here for a similar problem and solution:

A: Another trick is to extract the file from your installer disc. You can either open the .mpkg and look for the specific installer .pkg and extract the contents wholesale out of the .bom archive
An alternative is that you can use a utility like Pacifist to do the job for you. (I've never used Pacifist, it costs a small amount of money).
