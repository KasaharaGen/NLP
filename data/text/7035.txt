Q: Is it possible to automatically configure multiple iPads with the same settings? I need to configure a bunch of iPads with the same settings. For instance, volume level, auto-lock, side-button, timezone and light level.
Currently I'm doing this manually on each iPad through the Settings app in the device. This is both tedious and error-prone...
I'm thinking it should be possible to create a master settings file or image file (or something) with the correct settings which could then be loaded on to each device.
Is that possible?
Background: We need deliver iPads preconfigured with our "kiosk" app for customers to place in their office/retail locations. For instance, disabling auto-lock is crucial here. Currently I have some 20-30 iPads that needs to be configured the same way. 

A: iPhone Configuration Utility
You can use Apple's free iPhone Configuration Utility on Mac or Windows to create custom .XML configuration profiles for the iPad and install them to iPads over USB. I do not know which specific parameters you will have access to configure.
There is also a third-party MDM (Mobile Device Manager) server platform for rolling out custom apps and the like. That would probably be way overkill for your needs.

Update
March 7, 2012--Apple has released a new program called Configurator for mass deployment of iPads and iPhones in school, businesses, and institutions. It is free in the Mac App Store.

A: Apple Configurator
Apple released another program in April 2012 with considerably expanded capabilities. 
This should come much closer to meeting your needs.

A: You may want to have a look at Apple's iPad Enterprise Resources page. It has deployment guides, but I think the options you can set are more along the lines of security profiles and such. I'm not sure if general settings type options are in there. Worth a look however, as to my knowledge it's the only way of managing iOS settings other than manually on each one.
