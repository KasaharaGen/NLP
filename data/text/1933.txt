Q: How can I install boot camp if I have a Windows 7 upgrade CD? I have the following CD's:


*

*Windows Vista Home Premium (Upgrade)

*Windows Vista Ultimate (Full)

*Windows 7 Professional (Upgrade)


I would like to install Windows 7 on a mac with boot camp. It seems that Apple doesn't support installations via upgrade discs.
From what I understand, this means that I can't simply begin the installation using the Windows 7 CD, since it is an upgrade version. What I didn't understand, though, is if I can upgrade the OS once it is installed. For example, if I install the full version of Windows Vista Ultimate, could I then upgrade it to Windows 7? Or is my only option to purchase a full edition of Windows 7?

A: Actually, it's not that Apple won't let you install Windows from an upgrade discâ€”it's Microsoft that won't.
Think of it in terms of a blank hard drive on (what will be) a Windows PC. You can't use an upgrade disc to install Windows, as there's no OS there to upgrade.
However, once Windows is installed, you can then upgrade to a later version of Windows. This is covered in the Boot Camp
Installation & Setup Guide (pdf), page 15+.

A: What @dori said is correct. The ability (or lack of) to upgrade a Windows edition to another, is restricted by Microsoft. If what you have is correct, you could install Vista Ultimate and then upgrade to Windows 7, however, this is a bad idea in terms of final results. 
Windows 7 "upgrades" haven't been too smooth according to users doing that both in Virtual Machines, Bootcamp and Native PCs. In fact, I have some Microsoft friends who recommended that I perform fresh W7 installs. 
If you still want to try it, you can follow Microsoft's guide about Upgrading from vista to w7.
