Q: Print .docx without Pages.app Sometimes I simply want to print Microsoft Word documents. If I view them in Quick Look, they display as I would like to print them. However, when I try to print them from the Finder, it opens Pages.app and the rendering is significantly different.
Is there anyway to print the document as Quick Look renders it?

A: You can open Word documents with the built-in TextEdit app.
It will display and print them the same way (as far as I can tell) as QuickLook does.
