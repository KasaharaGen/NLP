Q: Entourage window resizing issue Could someone tell me how to retain the email window to the full page size eachtime I open entourage.?
When I open the new email window it opens in a small window, in then have to drag the window to use it comfortably.
I close down reataining these sizes and when I open the entourage later it always goes back to the small window!
It is driving me crazy?

A: It's most likely that your Entourage preferences file is corrupted in some fashion. Try this:


*

*Close Entourage. 

*Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Entourage.plist.

*Move the file to the Desktop. 

*Open Entourage, resize the window to your preferred size. Entourage will automatically make a new preferences file. 

*Close and open Entourage again to test that the change sticks.


If all is well, you can trash the original com.microsoft.Entourage.plist file from your Desktop.
