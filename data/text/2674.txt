Q: How to remove unfinished Boot Camp Partition? When I tried to create a new partition using Boot Camp it suddenly crashed and my computer restarted. Apparently the partition was created because the 50GB I specified during creation are gone from my HDD but the partition never got registered. How can I remove the partition and begin from scratch? 

A: One option is to boot from your Mac OS X Install CD and edit the partitions using the Disk Utility (found in the menu). This can be very handy for removing partitions that just won't die.
