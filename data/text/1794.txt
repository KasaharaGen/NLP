Q: How can I show the battery as a percentage on my iPod Touch? On the iPhone, to show the percentage of battery left, I can go into Settings > General > Usage and toggle "Battery Percentage" on.
My daughter's iPod touch doesn't have a Usage category.  Is there a way on the iPod touch to display the battery percentage?

A: If jailbroken, SBSettings has a toggle for this. 

A: No iPod Touches can show the battery percentage at the top of the screen (unless you jailbreak them). There are apps in the App Store that will show the battery percentage when you run them, but obviously not all the time. 
There's a discussion thread here: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1013295

A: If you would like your your iPod to tell you your battery level as a percentage go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Triple-click Home, and select "Toggle VoiceOver". After you are done, go to your home screen and triple click the home button. VoiceOver will activate. Then tap the battery icon. VoiceOver will say the battery percentage aloud. To turn VoiceOver off, triple click the home button again. 
This will only work on 3rd-gen or newer iPod touches and iPhone 3GS or newer.

A: If your charging an iPod Touch the lock screen will show the current battery percentage briefly when turned on while charging. 
Connect working charger percentage should show on screen.
Press power button to lock 
Press home or power button once
Watch for battery percentage to show under large current time.
Pretty lame would be nice if Apple could be consistent across all the iDevices for things like this including  battery health and a calculator too.
