Q: Can not update to Safari 5.1 in Lion I have updated from Snow Leopard to Lion with Safari Version 5.0.5.
Now I can not update to Safari 5.1. There is no update in the Software Updater, and on the apple-download page, I only found a Safari 5.1 for Snow Leopard. When executing it, there is an error message, that it is for 10.6 only ().
Any idea how to get full screen browsing?
