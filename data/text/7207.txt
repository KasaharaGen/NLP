Q: Lion login screen when using two screens When logging into Lion with a second screen attached, does the second screen always have a plain grey background as opposed to the textured background that the primary screen has?
Is there a way to change the login wallpaper on only the second screen?

A: I believe the answer is "no". You can select a custom desktop picture for Lion, but I know of no way to select different pictures for each screen.
