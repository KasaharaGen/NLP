Q: Display is set to Mobile PC Display on Windows when I run it on  Macbook Pro via boot camp Just installed Windows using boot camp. I downloaded the drivers using boot camp. After installing the display says: Mobile PC Display. I have 15 inch Macbook Pro.  What display driver do I need to get the right resolution?
Update: Okay. My bad. Went to Genius bar at apple they told me that Mobile PC Display is how Macbook sees your display on Windows. Resolution is 1440 x 900 what my resolution on Macbook. There is no missing driver after all. 


A: Your MacBook has a AMD Radeon HD 6490M video card per your properties screen. You'll need to download the driver from AMD's website.
For Windows 7:

For your display driver you might need to update your Bootcamp drivers which you can get from Apple's Boot Camp Support Drivers.
