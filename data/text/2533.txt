Q: Can I transfer photos from iPhone 4 to a MacBook via Bluetooth? Is there any way to transfer photos from the iPhone 4 camera roll to a MacBook over Bluetooth?

A: I know you asked if it was possible over Bluetooth and although my research didn't turn up anything for non-jailbroken phones, here is a WiFi solution which you could use on an Ad-hoc network that would work effectively the same way.
Non Jailbroken


*

*WiFi: WiFi Photo Transfer (App Store)

*iPhone to iPhone: Bluetooth Photo Share (App Store)
Jailbroken

*iBlueNova (Cydia)
