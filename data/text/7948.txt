Q: Message tone played multiple times on receiving message/notification on iOS 5 I've an iPhone 4 and I've installed iOS 5 on it. Since then, whenever I receive a text message or an app notification, the tone plays like "tre..tre..tre..tre..te..tre..tre...tring". Sometimes it takes a whole 5 to 7 secs for the sound to be complete.
At first, I thought it's because of the beta; but I guess they should've fixed it by now as it is already some Beta 3 if I'm not wrong!
Does anyone know any settings change/fixes that can fix it?

A: Ok, I had the exact same issue after updating to IOS 5, SMS tones sounded like a stuck record and very garbled. Solution is back-up your iphone then do a complete restore and at the end set up as a new iphone NOT backup from previous. The back-up can cause glitches when 1st updating from 4.3.5 to 5. Then unplug and plug back in and right click your iphone and do a "restore from back-up" after the setup as new iphone. Hope that helps for you as it did for me.
