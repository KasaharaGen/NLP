Q: iPhone restarts whenever a call is made I updated my iPhone yesterday and now whenever I take or make a call my phone restarts itself.
It was updated via iTunes on my computer. Each phone call can last between 1 - 10 minutes.
I've never had this problem before.

A: Sounds like either a bug or the update didn't work properly.  
That said, you should re-apply the update using these instructions from Apple support.
