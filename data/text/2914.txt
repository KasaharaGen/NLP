Q: Tile Finder background image in Snow Leopard I have seen a guide/tip on the internet to make Finder tile it's background by editing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist however the guide is now outdated and no longer works on Snow Leopard.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to go about this?

A: It can't be done right now.  Even if you made a background image in Photoshop the size of your display and used that, you'll find that with certain views (eg narrowed windows), you'll still see the edge of the image.
Someone somewhere just might write an app to do this, and in my opinion it would be popular.
Until then, we're stuck with just colors.

A: Finder provides this functionality in its View Options.
Go to icon view (cmd + 1) and open View Options (cmd + j).
There you may choose between White color, custom color, or a picture.
Select picture, drag and drop your picture there and you're done :)
Edit: 
In order to make the change system-wide, after setting the image you need to click on "Use as Defaults"

A: From what I can tell, Snow Leopard did indeed lose the ability to tile the Finder background image.
As an alternative, perhaps you could try creating a new large image composed of the image you want tiled manually. Then this could be used as the Finder background image and it will look tiled.
