Q: Look Up in Dictionary with "All" filter I like the fact that I can launch the dictionary app by highlighting a word in any any application and then going to (Application Name) > Services > Look Up in Dictionary.
However, this selects the Dictionary filter (instead of All, Thesaurus, Apple, or Wikipedia). I would prefer if it selected the All filter instead. Is there any way to create such a global menu item/shortcut which would do the same thing as lookup in dictionary but have it select the All filter instead of the Dictionary filter?

A: The only way I could get this to work is by creating a new service that looks up the word and than tells Dictionary.app to use the "all" filter.


*

*Open /Applications/Automator.app and select the services template

*in the top right part of the screen, you should see that the default input parameters Automator has selected ("Service receives selected text in any application") is just what you want

*in the left hand search field, search for an Action called "Run Applescript" and drag it into your workflow

*replace the part "(* Your script goes here *)" with the following Applescript, and than choose File->Save. Automator will ask you for a name for your new service (eg. "lookup in all dictionaries" and from that moment on, your service will be available in all applications.
set dictLocation to "dict:///" & input
open location dictLocation
 tell application "System Events" to tell process "Dictionary" to keystroke "0"    using command down


*(optional) You might also want to define a shortcut for you new service by going into  "System Preferences">"Keyboard">"Keyboard Shortcuts">"Services", finding your Service in the list of Services, and double-clicking the whitespace next to it do define a global shortcut.
