Q: Mac Mini as a bluetooth headset? Is it possible to have a Mac Mini running OSX act as a bluetooth headset for the iPhone? (sound comes out the mini's speakers, sound goes in the mini's mic)
I'm guessing that the mini would have to support the bluetooth headset profile?

A: I use the Belkin Bluetooth receiver to stream music to the speakers connected to my older Core Duo mini with the free LineIn by Rogue Amoeba. I've not worked out getting microphone input to the iPhone but am guessing it's might not be possible. 

A: You could use http://www.airserverapp.com/ . It basically turns you mac into and AirPlay device for Video, Audio and Pictures. It will not use bluetooth, but your local network which has it's benefits, (range mostly).
