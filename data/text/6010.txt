Q: Will DVD Studio Pro work on an Intel Mac? I am looking at using DVD Studio Pro on an Intel MBP. 
1. Which version will work?
2. How much control do I have over the DVD?
This is kinda two questions, so if needed I can split it. Just let me know.

A: DVD Studio Pro 4.1 is the first Intel comparable version of the software. I believe that came with Final Cut Studio. 
You have great control over DVD authoring. The best if not only solution on the Mac. Menus, scripting, tracks, etc.
