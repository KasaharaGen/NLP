Q: iPhone Application for Email Address Shortcut Does anybody know of an iPhone application or shortcut that allows you to save your email address access it via a shortcut?  This would be super useful when filling in forms in Safari or in when your email address is required in an application.

A: An excellent application for shortcuts is Smile Software's TextExpander touch. Because of limitations in iOS, it doesn't work to expand shortcuts in every app (including, sadly, all of Apple's apps). From the manufacturer's site:

Given the current feature set of the
  iPhone OS, TextExpander touch cannot
  work in the background (as it does in
  Mac OS X), expanding text snippets
  while you work in other apps, except
  for apps with TextExpander-integration
  built-in. You must first compose your
  text in the TextExpander touch Compose
  screen, and then transfer it to
  another app.


A: If you are willing to jailbreak, Action Menu does what you are looking for. I have put my e-mail address in the favorites tab of that program and I can now reach it anywhere.
