Q: Is there a way to cancel or disable the slow dock transition easter eggs? If you shift-click the minimize button or hold shift while restoring a window, you get the slow-motion genie or scale effect.
Is there a way to resume full speed after an accidental shift-click?
Is there a way to disable the shift-click combination so that the transition always runs at full speed?

A: There is a way!
Open Terminal.app
Then, type this and type the following:   
defaults write com.apple.finder FXEnableSlowAnimation -bool false

To make it go on again, just change the false to true.
Edit: 
It seems that there is no way to disable the Slow Animation special effects on shift-click.
