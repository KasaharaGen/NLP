Q: Decrypt Keychain with Password outside of Keychain-App so here is my problem:
we all know that the osx keychain is located in ~/Library/Keychains/something.keychain
now i've got this file and i know the master password for this keychain. is there a way to browse the keys in there using a external software or something? I don't want to import this keychain into my current one (if its possible).
Any ideas?

A: I use the following script to extract a password from the Keyring:

$ cat get_password_from_keyring 
#!/bin/bash
security find-generic-password -a $1 -g 2>&1 | grep password | cut -d \" -f 2
