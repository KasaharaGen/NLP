Q: How do I use tmutil to figure out what's wrong with my Time Machine? How do I use tmutil to figure out what is wrong with my Time Machine as it keeps backing up huge amounts of data each time it back-ups although nothing has changed since the last back up?
I'm backing-up to a Drobo FS

A: You can use timedog to see what's being backed up each time. 
Usage:


*

*Open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities)

*cd /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/[Computer Name]
Note Time Machine may be different on your system.
Replace [Computer Name] with the name of your computer (see System Preferences => Sharing).

*/path/to/timedog -d 5 -l
For instance, if you unzipped timedog to your Desktop, the path would be ~/Desktop/timedog
And then look at the output

A: Use
tmutil listbackups

to get a list of existing (completed) backups.
Then run one or both of
tmutil compare # to compare current drive to latest backup
tmutil compare /one/path/from/list /other/path/from/list # compare two backups
