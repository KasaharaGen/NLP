Q: How to delete a song from inside an iPod? My girlfriend has an iPod Nano (3G) and she asked me how she can delete a song from inside iPod. 
I didn't find any option inside the device, is it really like that? Can I delete songs only using iTunes?

A: Correct, on a stock iPod that is non jail broken, you can only delete music via iTunes.
