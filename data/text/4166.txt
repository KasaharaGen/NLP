Q: How to move Mail messages from Apple Mail back on to Hotmail server? When I first configured Apple Mail, I mistakenly opted not to keep a copy of mail on the Hotmail server. I've now changed that, but would like to move Inbox items that are on Apple Mail back on to the Hotmail server.
Any ideas how I can do that? 

A: *

*Setup a second account in Mail for your Hotmail account. This time choose Exchange IMAP for the protocol, not POP3. (Use the server settings here: http://www.sirslur.com/2010/09/01/hotmail-has-imap-and-works-on-iphone/)

*Drag your messages from your previous Hotmail account to your new IMAP-enabled Hotmail account.

*Grab coffee and wait.
Sometimes messages will fail to sync. Just re-drag them as previously to re-sync them.

A: Unable to create second account as it is has the same email.  "The account "email" already has the host name and user name."
