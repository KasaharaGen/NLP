Q: Macbook pro trackpad stops working after plugging in USB mouse in Windows 7 under bootcamp We have a new Macbook Pro which we've installed Windows 7 under boot camp. We've also installed the drivers off the OSX CD.
When I plugged in a USB mouse the Trackpad stops working, which is fine because I've got the mouse. When I unplug the USB mouse the track pad still doesn't work.
Has anyone else experienced the behaviour? Is there a solution to it?

A: During boot camp assistant partitioning, it prompted you to create  windows support folder. After installing windows you should have run setup from this folder. If you run it again and reboot, you should have your track-pad driver restored. When you run it again, select repair.
