Q: Why won't Subversion remember certificates? I'm using Terminal and committing some data to a remote SVN server... every time I get the same message about a new certificate, and I choose to "permanently" accept the cert and it works. However, the next time I commit... same thing. Why isn't the cert being remembered, and how can I fix this?
flat:smarty e$ svn commit ./ -m commit

Error validating server certificate for 'https://x.svn.x.com:443':
 - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!

 - Hostname: *.svn.x.com

A: This doesn't sound like a Terminal problem, but a subversion and/or permissions problem. Did it work at one point in the past, or has it always been a problem?
Most likely the issue is somewhere inside of ~/.subversion/auth/. You could try blowing away the directory, though that will require you to recreate all your credentials. (Maybe something in there is borking up authentication process.)
I suggest you try to recreate your problem with another user profile, computer, or operating system, and compare ~/.subversion directories with your broken system.
If you are convinced its the Terminal's fault, you can try iTerm2, though I expect the same results in the same environment. Good luck!

A: I've had the same issue, all files in ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/ were set to read-only.
Running chmod u+w ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/* fixed it.
