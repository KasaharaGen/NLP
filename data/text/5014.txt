Q: What tool can I use to manage notes and/or bookmarks for a collection of PDF files? I am doing some research and I do put lots of notes and bookmarks in the books (PDF files).
I am looking for a tools that will allow me to see and search inside all these notes.
I supposed that this tools should be able to scan a directory with PDF files, for notes and keep them in sync.

A: You should try Mendelely, a Reference Manager with Dropbox-like sharing/syncing. It reads Comments from PDFs, but sometimes mixes them up. In my example i had saved an Article as a PDF with the Headline as the Filename, but Mendeley indexed my Comment as the Filename. 
You should also take a look at Eaglefiler, as the name says more Archiv-oriented.

A: Sounds like you need  Papers

A: What about Evernote.. There may be issues like limited uploaded. But you may go for premium option.
