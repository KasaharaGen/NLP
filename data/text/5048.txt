Q: iPhone 4 iTunes podcast list shows 3-4 words max? I thought I would download a few podcasts with my iPhone.  I was sad to see that they all look like this:


*

*Some Person discusses ...

*Fulano Tal shows how ...

*How to fully setup a ...


How can I get a list that will wrap and show more than 3-4 words. 

A: I suggest searching for podcasts on the iTunes web interface from within mobile Safari. Both Bing and Google accept a site parameter that will allow you to filter for a specific site. In thie case, you could search for a podcast and add the site:itunes.apple.com parameter at the end. Like this: 

this week in tech site:itunes.apple.com

The search results in Safari should be easier to read. Each link should open in the iTunes app in your iPhone. Hope this helps. 

A: As far as I know this is not possible. The iPhone screen is just to small. I am using the Mac to search for podcasts.
Maybe some of the third party apps could help.
