Q: "not supported on this architecture" error (git) I'm trying to install the Gitx Git client on my friend's mac and it seems to install fine but when I run it I get the following error:  
You cannot open the application "GitXStable" because it is not supported on this architecture.
Ideas?

A: Intel application on a PowerPC Mac. Or vice versa. See if you can find an "Universal Binary" version of the application, which will run on either platform.
This link has a Universal Binary version: http://frim.frim.nl/GitXStable.app.zip

A: I recommend you to use this version of GitX. Here is the direct link to download.
Supported architectures are ppc7400, i386, x86_64.
