Q: Learn OS X hacks/tweaks and resources I bought a MBP a month ago and as a developer and a first time Mac user I want to get my hands dirty with the OS, I found a lot of tweaks and hacks for example:
$ defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES; killall Dock

Instead of just coping commands I want to learn and understand these commands, any recommended resources - books, sites, etc.  Running OS X Lion.
Thanks,

A: There is a book called "Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach" by Amit Singh. It is a little bit old and covers 10.4 (with the occasional outlook on 10.5) but is very detailed about the core stuff. I learned a great deal from it.

A: Get the secrets presence pane here. It's a preference pane that acts as GUI for all these various hidden preferences.
