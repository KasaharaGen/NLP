Q: How can I activate my iPod if my PC is running Linux? I just bought an iPod, and when I turn it shows an image with the USB cable and iTunes. It wants me to plug it to a computer with iTunes? But I use Linux, what do I do?

A: A few solutions, not all of them good:


*

*If possible, update to iOS 5 (probably at the Apple Store) and don't use iTunes.

*Find a friend with a Mac or a PC and get them to activate it.

*Go to the Apple Store (as Randolph said) and ask them.

*Run Windows in VirtualBox (or another VM solution), and use iTunes from there. (thanks, Fake Name)

*Get sixty million of your best friends to switch to Linux and all complain at Apple for a Linux port of iTunes.

*Run iTunes in Wine, if that's possible.
