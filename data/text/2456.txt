Q: I cannot connect to my workplace VPN My workplace has VPN and it works great for me in Parallels Windows XP and Bootcamp Windows Vista. However, with the same config, I can't get it to work in Snow Leopard. I don't know what type of server they are using, but PPTP works for Windows. Any ideas why it may work for Windows and not OS X?
Update: I should also mention that at one point it did work. I couldn't tell you if anything changed at the server between when it did work and when it stopped.
More information: I can connect just fine, but I can't access any resources. I try to ping a known internal IP address and the destination can't be reached.

A: I've had trouble with VPN before on my setup. I fixed my problem, but I had to do a couple of weird things first. Could you tell me more about your settings?
Under System > Preferences > Advanced... 


*

*Under (tab) DNS > DNS Servers: Do you have your DNS servers set?
a. If so, are they something like 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.4?
   You may need to change your home router's IP address if so.

*Under (tab) DNS > Search Domains: do you have a search domain set?
ie. domain.local
I hope changing those settings helps. If not let me know and I'll try to help. VPN has been enormously frustrating for me in the past.

A: In my experience, this is usually due to authentication or encryption.  Double-check your settings.  Also I wonder if the server may be on an encryption scheme unsupported by OS X.

A: @Am1rr3zA Had the answer in this case, though I have tried this in the past and have had it fail.
