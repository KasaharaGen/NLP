Q: Is there a file copy utility for OS X that's similar to TeraCopy for Windows? On Windows, I use TeraCopy for improved file copying. Are there any similar equivalents for OS X?
In particular, I'd like to see things like copy speed.

A: The best suggestions from this thread are:


*

*Pathfinder

*XFile

*UltraCopier

*MiniCopier

A: Since you mentioned “better” and in particular “copy speed”, I believe the only answer is Xfile. Other than that, nothing will beat cp ;)

The world’s fastest file manager for OS X

It’s not free, quite the contrary. 

A: Try Ultracopier, looks a bit like TeraCopy and works on Mac & PC

A: While much more than just a copy utility, Pathfinder shows copy speed. Along with Launchbar, it's one of my must have utilities.

A: I know this question is nearly 12 years old and may be obsolete but there is actually official TeraCopy for Mac.

A: An app I developed, Ultracopier, fits your use case.
Here is a YouTube demo showcasing the PC version in action. 

A: I looked around for something like TeraCopy a while back but everything I found was pretty horrid.  In the end I decided to just use cp and rsync on the command line.

A: Have you first compared speeds between TeraCopy and the built in Mac OS X file copy? I hate to sound like a generic condescending Mac user, but what exactly is wrong with the built in one?

A: You may also consider Hedge for Mac tool. It's mostly for backup purposes and can be used to fast copy large files/folders. It has free version but most interesting features are to be paid.

A: There is one application that I found online that works similar to TeraCopy, and that, too, is for Mac OS X and named Turbo Copy Pro.
This is a multi-function application and you can view the copy speed and also pause and resume the copy process similar to TeraCopy. The only drawback it has is that it is not free.
I have tried and tested the trial version and it worked absolutely fine. Please have a look and post your review.
