Q: Changing the DVD Drive in a Mac Pro I have a spare BluRay Drive. I wonder if I can replace the Superdrive in my Mac Pro? I know I could install it along side, but I need the drive very rarely, so I just prefer to replace it.
I'm mainly concerned about the ability to boot and install Mac OS X from it, and about compatiblity with Disk Utility and other burning Software like iLife and DVD Studio Pro. I know that BluRay isn't supported (I dual boot Windows for that purpose)
