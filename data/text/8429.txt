Q: iPhone IMAP GMail push Seeing as Yahoo (japan) got imap push to iOS devices working today (it's working on my phone now), is there a way to set it up with a GMail account?

A: Gmail doesn't offer IMAP push for iOS (IMAP idle isn't supported by iOS Mail), but Google Sync (which actually uses MS exchange mobile protocol) which doesn't only push your mails but also syncs your contacts and calendars (if you wish to).

As of Janury 30, 2013, Google terminated Active Sync support for free users.
