Q: How to share my Snow Leopard Mac's connection to my HTC Desire running Android? I have an HTC Desire that currently cannot connect to the internet and a Mac that can. I want the HTC Desire to be able to connect to the internet.
My Mac (running Snow Leopard 10.6.6) is connected to the internet over Wi-Fi.
Now I want to share my Mac's internet connection with my HTC Desire (Android 2.2).
On my HTC Desire I don't have root access.
On my Mac I have super user access.
Can I share my internet connection?
If it doesn't work with a Mac can i get this to work with Windows?
I do have a jailbroken iPod touch 2g with iOS 4.0, if the helps with any of this.

A: OK so you need to connect to the internet via your MacBook to get around a MAC filter on your router.  You can share your MacBooks connection but it would need to be plugged into the router.
I don't think it's possible to do it like this:
HTC >> WiFi >> MacBook >> WiFi >> router
You need to do it like this instead:
HTC >> WiFi >> MacBook >> Ethernet >> router
So you plug the MacBook into the router and connect to that from your phone over WiFi.  You can do this as follows:


*

*Choose Apple > System Preferences, and then click Sharing.

*Select Internet Sharing.

*Choose a network service from the “Share your connection from” pop-up menu, Ethernet for example in your case.

*Select a networking service to share your Internet connection from the “To computers using” list, AirPort for example.

*Click AirPort Options and give your network a name and password.

*Connect to your MacBook over the WiFi network you just set up.


A: *

*Use Jailbroken iPod 2G to spoof the Mac MAC address, so your iPod is now online.

*Tether the Mac to the iPod and use PdaNET or MyWi on the iPod so that your Mac is online through your tethered iPod

*On the Mac, set up Internet Sharing, and share your existing connection from the tether to a WiFi network

*On the HTC, connect to the WiFi network.
