Q: Mail.app notification filtering Is it possible to disable notification generated by Mail.app for a certain set of folders?
For e.g. if have Inbox and Inbox > fol1 & Inbox > fol2, I want notification from Inbox and fol1 only.
Would this be possible with growl somehow?

A: You should be able to do this by setting up Rules in Mail.app that filter on the criteria you desire and then run an AppleScript that triggers a Growl notification. Rules are setup in Mail.app under Preferencesâ€¦->Rules.
Growl can be called from AppleScript as shown here.

A: Use Smart Mailboxes to filter the mailboxes viewable,
