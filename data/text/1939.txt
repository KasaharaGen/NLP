Q: Rent foreign language films in iTunes Itâ€™s now pretty well-established that you cannot change the language of the iTunes store unless you also change your billing address.
Fair enough.
But the language setting also dominates the contents of the store completely. I.e. I cannot download films that, though available in the US, have not (yet) appeared on DVD in Germany (having a German billing address).
This is annoying.
But it gets worse: apparently I also cannot rent/buy the original version of most DVDs that are available.
When I buy a DVD in Germany, it always also contains the original voice track. No reason not to include it, after all. Since most film translations are sloppy and generally just incredibly poorly done, and since even the well done translations necessarily lose some of the finer nuances, I always try to watch the original versions of films of which I understand the language, and I know a lot of people who do the same.
So this must be a common request.
Is there any way to rent/buy the original version of the available iTunes films?

A: Short (and only) answer: No, you cannot rent or buy movies in other languages. I share the same problem in Spain, movies are dubbed in spanish. 
Matrix sounds hilarious in spanish, trust me. 
There's no way to change that. The only solution is -like you've said- switch to the US Store, but that requires billing address changes and all the hurdles involved in that. 

A: If you find someone who can provide you a foreign gift card from your desired country, you can use it to create an account and purchase from the store of that country.
