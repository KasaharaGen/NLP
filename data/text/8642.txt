Q: Is there a way to change which shares are shown on the bottom of the iOS 5 notifications screen? The bottom of the iOS 5 notifications screen show the Shares for some enterprises (Apple, Google, Yahoo!). Is there a way to configure which one I want to see?

A: The shares shown are the one you set up in the Stocks app.


*

*Open *Stocks

*Tap the i on the bottom right corner

*Delete or add new shares


Those will be the ones shown in the notifications screen.
