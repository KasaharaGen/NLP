Q: What tools are there for measuring Macbook wireless strength? I often have trouble connecting to wifi with my MacBook Pro. To help identify the problem, I was wondering if there were any tools for measuring wireless signal strength.

A: You can get quite a bit of info from the command line, with the (well-hidden) airport utility.  With the -I flag it'll tell you about the current network:
$ /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I
     agrCtlRSSI: -43
     agrExtRSSI: 0
    agrCtlNoise: -96
    agrExtNoise: 0
          state: running
        op mode: station 
     lastTxRate: 130
        maxRate: 130
lastAssocStatus: 0
    802.11 auth: open
      link auth: wpa2-psk
          BSSID: 0:24:1:0a:42:93
           SSID: My Wireless
            MCS: 15
        channel: 5

...and -s will show more info about other visible networks:
$ /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s
                            SSID BSSID             RSSI CHANNEL HT CC SECURITY (auth/unicast/group)
                     My Wireless 00:24:01:fa:42:93 -44  5       Y  -- WPA(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/TKIP,AES/TKIP) 
                          hobbit 00:15:05:19:8a:03 -86  7       N  -- WEP 
                     My Wireless 00:24:01:ef:91:ab -75  3       Y  -- WPA(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP)

It doesn't have a man page, but if you run it without any options it'll list its options.

A: System Profiler will list available Wireless Networks as well as the following information
NetworkName:
  PHY Mode: 802.11n
  BSSID:    c0:3f:e:df:1b:be
  Channel:  6
  Network Type: Infrastructure
  Security: WEP


A: If you find that your connection problems occur in the same location, you could use a tool like NetSpot that would let you visually see areas of low signal. NetSpot is free and available within the App Store.
See below for an example of how a map of your apartment's wifi signal could look.

Macworld reviewed Netspot and published a brief tutorial last year about how it could be used.

A: Another, out-of-the-box way (at least on Mountain Lion):


*

*Click on the Apple (top left)

*About this Mac

*More Info

*System Report

*WiFi


This will show you all the info you want for all the networks in range, without needing to install additional software.

A: I typically use WiFi Explorer. Its newer than iStumbler and provides the following features:


*

*Easy-to-use, intuitive user interface.

*Graphical visualization of the wifi environment.

*Works with 802.11a, b, g and n wireless networks.

*Supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands as well as 20 and 40 MHz
channels.

*Signal quality estimations based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

*Accurate conversion from dBm to percentage (%) for easier analysis
and optimization.

*Export metrics and network details to CSV file format.

*Full screen mode (10.7 or above).

*Comprehensive help.

*Runs in Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion.


It's available in the Mac App store. It's priced at .99 cents. Developers are responsive to questions.


A: If you're just looking for a quick signal strength number, option-click on the AirPort icon in the menu bar. Under the connected network you will see several pieces of information:

RSSI is your signal strengh in dB. Higher (closer to 0) is better.
If you're looking for noise or the signal strength for multiple access points, I suggest checking out iStumbler:

Is this useful ?
I am actually in a relatively small village, not in New York, or LA :)
