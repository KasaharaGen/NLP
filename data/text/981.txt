Q: How can iPhone be used when wearing gloves? In colder weather wearing gloves is essential. Looks like iPhone 4 completely ignores touches of fingers in gloves. So I sometimes even see people controlling their iPhones by touching them with their noses.
What are the limitations of how iPhone can be controlled? How can it be used by a person wearing gloves?

A: You can buy conductive thread and then weave the thread into any pair gloves that you own.

A: I like these lambswool gloves by Dots. I imagine they use some sort of conductive thread woven in the fabric, and they're quite affordable at $15.50 to $20.


A: The screen is a capacitive touch device so it depends on a conductive item contacting it. A number of companies have produced gloves with appropriately conductive finger pads.
