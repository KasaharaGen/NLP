Q: Stuck in a calendar on iPhone I have an iPhone 3G. How can I get out of one of Calendars on my iPhone.  It is stuck in an empty calendar and doesn't allow me to get out of it to add any new events.  I've tried backing out of the calendar program to no avail.  And I've restarted my phone, also to no avail.  Does anyone have a suggestion?

A: *

*Double tap the start button, and it will bring up a list of running programs.  

*Press and hold one of them, and they will start to jiggle, and show an - icon in the upper left corner.

*Find the calendar program, and tap the -.

*Rinse and repeat for any other apps you're having trouble with.  I like to periodically go through the list and close down apps I'm not using/won't use for a while


NOTE: Do this from the home screen. If you are in the app it won't appear in the queue of running apps.

A: I had the same problem. However, when I did the double click, it brought up all open programs EXCEPT the calendar.  I had to manually shut off and power back on, then my calendar item I added was there with the changes I had made.

A: This may suck, but try syncing through iTunes and manually removing the calendar, and re-adding it in an additional sync.
For future reference, iOS5 supports manual removal of Calendars. Unfortunately, only the iPhone 3GS and above are supported on iOS5. Good luck!
