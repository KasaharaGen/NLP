Q: How can I map the "Archived" folder to "All Mail"? I would like to map the "Archived" folder that's created when you Archive mail to the "All Mail" folder in my Gmail account.  How can I do this?

A: For some reason stackexchange isn't letting me comment on the approved answer.
In any case, jtbandes' comment is incomplete, you have to set the custom app shortcut as:
"Message>Move To>All Mail"
Note the lack of spaces between the words. This is critical; it won't work otherwise. Simply typing "All Mail" will trigger multiple, redundantly named menu items with the keyboard shortcut. 
I've assigned mine to Command-Y to approximate the Gmail shortcut.

A: You can't do this in Lion. File a bug if you want to be able to do this.

A: The odd thing is that for me, until this morning, (Aug 11/11) the archive button was sending emails to the All Mail folder. Suddenly today Mail created a new "archive" folder and is now putting archived emails there instead of All Mail.
I thought was dreaming, but I checked my all mail folder and I have emails there dated since I upgraded to Lion until yesterday.
Huh?
