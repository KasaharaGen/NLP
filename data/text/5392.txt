Q: Can I get Mission Control to show minimized windows? Exposé in Snow Leopard showed minimized windows — if any — in a dedicated area at the bottom. This was extremely helpful and efficient, especially combined with the "Minimize windows in application icon" setting of the Dock.
Mission Control is apparently done with this behavior, so monitoring and fetching minimized windows is now a pain.
Is there a way to show minimized windows anywhere in Mission Control?

A: If you exposé (three finger swipe down or whatever shortcut you've set up) you can then switch through all of the applications by pressing tab.  
Pressing tab on its own will go through each application showing all windows (minimised or not), pressing cmd and tab will show you the swap icon bar (in middle of screen) at the same time as going through the applications.  The arrow keys followed by enter will help you select what window you want.
It's certainly not as elegant as SL used to be, but it's the only thing I've found that kinda/sorta/maybe comes close.

A: The most straightforward way is to use Exposé on the application with minimized windows to show them.

A: I don't think it's turned on by default, but you can turn on App Exposé (which shows minimized windows) as a trackpad gesture using three or four finger swipes downward. It's in Trackpad>More Gestures. If that's not quite what you're looking for, you might also try Hyperdock, which replicates Windows 7's aero peek functionality on OS X; it includes minimized windows.

A: Press Command-Tab which will show applications including minimized ones. Highlight the one you are looking for, release Tab and while still holding Command press on Opt/Alt before letting all keys go. This will bring up the minimized application.
