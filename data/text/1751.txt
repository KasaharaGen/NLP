Q: When I add a file to iTunes library, does iTunes make a copy of it? If yes, where is the copy saved? When I add a file to iTunes library, does iTunes make a copy of it? If yes, where is the copy saved?

A: There's also a special folder inside your iTunes library folder (Whatever you set it to if not default) called "Automatically Add to iTunes" which is a watched folder. Any time you add a file to it, while iTunes is running, it'll grab it and move it to the correct location. I just use this now. I keep an alias to it in a Stack on my Dock.

A: If the option "Copy files to the iTunes Music folder when adding to library" is activated, iTunes makes a copy. 
The default storing location is:


*

*Windows 7: \username\Music\iTunes

*Windows Vista: \username\My Music\iTunes

*Windows XP and 2000: \Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\My Music\iTunes

*MAC OS X: ~/Music/iTunes/
