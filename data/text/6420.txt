Q: Is there a quick way to delete Foldered bookmarks directly from Safari bookmark bar? I like to group my bookmarks into Folders in the Bookmark Bar.
But I cannot find an easy way to delete these bookmarks!
The only way I know to do this is to go to Show All Bookmarks, then browse down to the shortcut and select it and delete it - this totally gets in the way of workflow.
Is there any way to delete a Foldered bookmark from the bookmark bar?!
NB - I am not talking about standalone bookmarks, deleting those is easy and intuitive.

A: Since it's a folder, hold down the Command and Option keys, then drag the folder off the Bookmarks Bar. You'll get a confirmation dialog saying "Are you sure?" Just click the Delete Folder button in the dialog.
Holding the Command and Control keys keys down gets you a contextual menu that allows you to edit the name of the folder, edit its contents (jumps you to the Bookmarks window to do that), delete it, copy it, and a few other things.

A: Using Open-Book-Icon probably is the easiest way to delete Safari folded bookmark

A: We're talking about the Bookmarks Bar in Safari, right?
Hold down the Command key and drag it offâ€”poof, disappears. 
Same thing with Finder toolbar (plus you can add anything you like to Finder Toolbar by holding down Command key while you drag it into place.)

A: Hit option+command+B. It will open a bookmark editor; it's very easy to delete anything within a folder from there.

A: Just delete the whole safari folder in the library directory
