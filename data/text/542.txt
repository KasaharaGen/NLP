It seems like it just assigns random color when you add a calendar.
Is there a way to change calendar color on iOS 4? I'd like to pick a color for each calendar...

A: The only way I know how to do it is in iCal (providing you have a Mac). Ctrl+click on the Calendar along the left side of the screen >> Get Info >> Click the color selector on the right to change the color. Here's a screenshot  


A: It seems impossible directly on the iPhone/iPod. I have a MobileMe account, and I can change the calendar colours from within the MobileMe web interface. Maybe this is possible with other snychable calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal), too. But I have none of them to try it.
