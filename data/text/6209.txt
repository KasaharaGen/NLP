Q: How can I troubleshoot sharing problems from outside the LAN? I'm trying to connect with a server that is not on the same network as my mac, when I enter the ip address the connection doesn't go through. The ip is correct, the server is on, and remote access & login are allowed; I even tried sending the login name i.e afp://ipaddres/shortname. Is there something I am not doing or doing wrong?

A: You may need to set up port forwarding so that you can connect to your server even though it's behind NAT from your router.
