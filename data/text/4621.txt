Q: Can I enable file removal in the open window on OS X? Can I enable file removal in the open window on OS X?
The open or save dialogs do not allow you do do many opeations, like removing a file or renaming it. 
Is there any hidden defaults preference that could enable this?

A: I've been using Default Folder X (35$) for years to add this capability, among many others.
