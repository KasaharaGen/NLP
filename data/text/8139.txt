Q: iBooks library empty after upgrade Since upgrading my iPad all the books are gone from my library yet when I go to iTunes it shows the books I purchased. Am I going to have to download them again? 

A: I think this can happen if you're a bit premature unplugging your iPad from iTunes.  Try plugging it in and resyncing.  

A: Assuming you didn't have any backup app like pkgbackup, you can still reload them from iTunes if you bought them.
