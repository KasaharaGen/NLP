Q: Creating an animation from a bunch of .pdf files I have histograms in a bunch of hundreds of .pdf files.
I would like to find a way to make an animation from these files to use in a Powerpoint presentation.
How can I do that ? It would also be great to be able to view the animation with Quicktime.

A: You could try the following:


*

*Join your PDF files: How to merge pdf files in Mac OS X â€“ CombinePDFs

*Convert your PDF to Keynote format: PDF to Keynote  

*Create your movie: Exporting Keynote Presentation to QuickTime Compatible Movie File
Later you can use your created .MOV in another Keynote presentation.
