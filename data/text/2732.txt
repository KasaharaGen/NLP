Q: Can I transfer and view xvid (avi) videos on an iPad? What type of video files can I watch on my iPad?
I usually only have .avi files; is there an app that will allow me to play them?

A: You could also try AirVideo, which will convert and stream xvid (and other formats) from a local PC.  You can connect to it via local network or remotely as well.http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html

A: You can use OPlayer HD to watch your video on your iPad. There's also a free ad-supported version available

A: I usually use Handbrake to convert everything to .mp4 or .m4v (iTunes-friendly extension) before importing it to iTunes and syncing it to an iDevice.  Just open it up and give it a source file, pick the proper preset, and press Go.

A: Another idea is converting your videos using Macroplant's Adapter. Quite simple to do.

A: Use VLC for the iPad (link is directly to the apple store for VLC)
