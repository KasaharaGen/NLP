Q: Split a single page PDF into multiple pages Is there an easy way (in Preview or whatever) to scale up and split a PDF file with a single page into multiple pages? What I would like is to split say an A3 paper document into two A4 pages, to print separately and then put together with tape.
How can I do such a thing in OS X?

A: After googling, I found that "Preview.app" and "Automator.app" can handle this job.


*

*Open the pdf file in Preview.app

*Show Thumbnail

*Select all pages

*From Menu, choose "Tools" - "Select Tool"

*Select right side of a page to crop

*From Menu, choose "Tools" - "Show Inspector"
7, On the "Inspector" window, choose "Crop and rotate inspector"

*Push "Crop" button (in "Selected Pages" group)

*From Menu, choose "File" - "Print", and choose "PDF" - "Save as PDF...", and save as "right.pdf"

*Do same thing(4-7) for left side and save as "leftside.pdf" 

*Start Automator.app and make workflow with following actions.
a. "Get Specified Finder Items" (choose "leftside.pdf" and "rightside.pdf")
b. "Combine PDF Pages"
c. "Move Finder Items"

*Run the Automator workflow.


A: A small JAVA program called Briss will do exactly this job.

A: Preview cannot do this unfortunately, but an $5 application called Tiler does this with ease.

Hope this helps.

A: I've made an open source and cross platform command line tool called pdftilecut which does exactly what the OP wants. It works with multi-page document of various sizes.

A: Adobe Reader can do this, too: It includes a Poster Print option in its custom print dialog. 
It’s the first time I missed a feature from Preview (or the native OS X print dialog) that Adobe Reader has. 
Adobe Reader is free (as in beer) software, it used to be called Acrobat Reader. (Do not confuse it with full-blown Acrobat or any other expensive Adobe product, which can probably do that, too.)

A: If you in Preview select the half of the A3 (e.g. use the Inspector ⌘+I so you get the exact size) - then choose Copy ⌘+C, and paste it as a new file ⌘+N (my suggestion would be to save each new file as its page number). After that do the same with the other half of the A3.
If you save every new file as its page number, then afterward you can select all the new files in Finder. Once they're all selected, right click and choose Quick Actions > Create PDF (available in macOS Mojave). You'll have a new PDF that is composed of every pdf you had selected.


A: See pdfposter (you can install it with macports):

A: I have been searching for a free solution for this and I stumbled a java app called 'briss' which does what it promised perfectly.

A: If you have Illustrator you can simply create a document with several letter size artboards and place the PDF.

A: Select option to print -> Poster 
This will split your page into your default page size(for letter size 8 x 11)
you can select tile scale to zoom within this split page. You can also select overlap. You can select labels so you know which page goes where.

A: This is an online  tool I found that worked for splitting an A0 format to multiple A4. https://online2pdf.com/split-page-into-4-parts#

A: You print to PDF with the following setting:
- change page setup to A4 size (if the original document was in A3)
- then print..
for the other side of page, you need to rotate the original file and do the same as above..
