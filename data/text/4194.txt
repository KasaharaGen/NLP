Q: Is there a reliable, automatic subtitle downloader for Mac OS X? On Ubuntu I use SMPlayer or SubDownloader, which both reliably retrieve subtitles from opensubtitles.org. SMplayer even does this automatically for the file you are currently viewing.
So far I've tried SolEol, FileBot, SubDownloader (which is a bit behind on versions for Mac OS; seems like the API URL for opensubtitles.org changed) and Undertext. None of them work reliably, some of them not at all.

A: I know this is an old question, but I was searching for this same answer, and found a great solution. 
Subliminal will allow you to set up a cron job, (or manually enter from CLI) whole directory trees, and download subtitles. You can also set it up as a post processor for SABNzbd or SickBeard or CouchPotato.
It's working great for me.

A: I found Subtitles recently. It looks nice and clean and seems to work quite well (I had lots of problems with Unicode support in subliminal).

A: I developed a free app to download subtitles on the Mac.

You can download it from here.
It downloads from OpenSubtitles.
It is not a signed application (I'm not willing to pay Apple two times, as I develop for iPhone and not for Mac), so you have to allow it to run through System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy.

A: I, too, have made a free utility for this purpose.
You can grab it fresh here: Sublime.

A: Subsmarine from cocoawithchurros provides a commercial solution.

A: I am using SPlayerX. It is a media player can auto download subtitles depending on the video you playing.

A: I use XBMC and it works like a charm!

A: I recommend Subtitles Wizard Plus for this use case.

A: I wrote a Python Script myself to download Subtitles. First I wrote a Python Script to download subtitles using thesubdb API, then I used automator to create a service. Installation is really painless.
Installation instructions and source is on my GitHub page.
