Q: Search a phrase using Spotlight I find Spotlight very very useful, however I would like to be able to search for documents that contain a given phrase, i.e. words appearing together, instead of anywhere in a document. Do you know of any way or plugin to perform such a search?

A: From the Mac OS X 10.5 Help

Use quotation marks around text to
  search for exact phrases — the same
  way you do with most Internet
  searches. For example, enter “trip to
  France” in the search field to find
  items on your computer that contain
  that exact phrase. If you didn't use
  quotes, the search results would
  include items that contain any of
  those words.
