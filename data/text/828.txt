Q: Upgrading from Parallels Desktop 5 to 6 caused DNS query resolution "slowness" at Mac OS X level Anybody else feeling this/have any idea how to fix it without reinstalling Snow Leopard?
This seems very similar to problems PD used to have back in 2008 (forum link)
FWIW, my current network interfaces are:
$ ifconfig -l
lo0 gif0 stf0 en0 en1 fw0 vnic0 vnic1 vmnet1 vmnet8

(And yes, as you can see from the NICs, I also run VMWare Fusion 3.1.1, but the issue started upon upgrading to PD6)

A: Start by making some tests in your Terminal:


*

*Use nslookup and try to lookup certain stuff (www.google.com, www.ibm.com, etc) See how it works from there.

*Use ‘dig’ (another command) to do the same. Dig will be much more verbose and will show you more information about the Lookup per se.

*Make sure your DNSs are correct in /etc/resolv.conf (try google’s 8.8.8.8 if unsure).

*Check your Console for possible messages related to Network adapters or loops going on.
Edit: It all seems “normal”. Do you use Shared networking? Can you try disabling vnic0 and vnic1 (those are the parallels ones). I recall having slowness problems (back in parallels 3.x) which I fixed by using Bridged Networking instead of shared. I didn’t think the issue was still an issue a few years later!
