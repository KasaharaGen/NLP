Q: Mac OS Desktop coordinate problem I'm having a hard time working with Mac OS screen coordinates.  I can use ⌘+⇧+4 to get them, but each of my monitors does not have a unique coordinate system??!?
I have a desktop of 4 screens arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each screen has a size of (2048 pixels x 1152 pixels).  (And the Apple Menu Bar is on the top-left screen).
⌘+⇧+4 gives the upper-left of each screen as (0,0) and the lower right as (2048,1152).
But each screen does that!
Technically, the coordinate system "should" run from (0,0) to (4096,2304). How do I differentiate the coordinates of the individual monitors?
Furthermore, when I create a window at (500,500) it creates it in the top-left monitor at (500,652)
So I just don't understand what's going on. How can I get an accurate coordinate map for the Mac OS desktop with multiple monitors?

A: If you have Developer Tools installed, you could try running Pixie.app and configuring that to give you coordinates. It might calculate them differently.
