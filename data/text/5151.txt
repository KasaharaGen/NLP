Q: Connecting Macbook Air 2011 to HP LP2475w monitor.. use DVI, HDMI or Display Port? The HP LP2475w supports all of the following inputs:

DVI-I, HDMI, DisplayPort, Component Video, S-Video, and Composite Video

Which one is the preferred to connect the Macbook Air's mini-display port to?

A: I have this monitor since 2008. My experience with a MacBook Pro 13" (early 2011) is:
HDMI
Any cable will do it, but you'll have to override the Mac OS X settings to force RGB mode. To do that follow the instructions in

DVI
No problem, but only with Apple's official adaptor + DVI to DVI cable. In this case, image quality is perfect and I haven't got issues waking from sleep. I also tried with a 43â‚¬ mini DisplayPort to DVI 1m cable from Clicktronic and I saw random red and green pixels on dark areas of the screen. I also observed this issue with another mini DisplayPort to DVI cable from a different (cheaper) manufacturer.
DisplayPort
Using CA's mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable I have extremely annoying jitters and shakes on the screen. In between those, the image quality is perfect but overall renders the usage annoying. It looks like it gets better as the monitor stays turned on for some time (about an hour). I've also observed issues when waking from sleep. Apparently the problem is not the cable, and reports of good compatibility do exist.

A: The MacBook Air (2010) had problems with this monitor connecting to the displayport on the monitor. (No problems with HDMI or DVI adaptors though.) Fonts are not rendered correctly - it's as though the MBA thinks it's a VGA or something and the fonts come out sort of chunky. The Mac Mini (2010) has the same problem. The problems on the mac side - other machines I've tried with displayport worked fine. I would have reservations as to whether Apple has fixed the problem in the 2011 macs.

A: Great question and great monitor.
Here is my order of preference:


*

*DisplayPort - native to the notebook and monitor. Just get a DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort cable and you're set.

*HDMI - Preferred over DVI, because it has HDCP.

*DVI - Last choice.


The rest options are not recommended.

A: DisplayPort is the preferred way.
