Q: How do I format a disk partition from the command line on OS X? How do I format a disk partition from the command line on Mac OS X?
In case someone wonders why: because for some people Disk Utility fails.

A: diskutil list
In my case I wanted to format the parition as NTFS for installing Windows 7 on it. The last parameter is the partition 4 on first disk.
diskutil eraseVolume "Tuxera NTFS" my-ntfs disk0s4

A: For those of you looking to format an entire disk and remove all partitions here is the command:
diskutil eraseDisk free itsfree /dev/disk6

Even though I am formatting with free space-- I still had to give it a name for the command to work, in this case itsfree.
