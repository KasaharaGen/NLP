Q: Where's my free space gone on my MP3 player? I have a Sansa Fuze MP3 player, it's 4 GB.
I plug it in my Mac I have a capacity of 3,7 GB of which apparently 1,8 GB is in use.
Problem is I only have arround 120 MB of MP3s on it...
Who's stealing my free space ?
Here are DiskInventoryX screenshots. I have the same results with du and the terminal.



A: It might also be the trash -- I'm not sure how DiskInventoryX copes with trash directories on external drives. It might be worth emptying your trash while the drive is mounted.

A: The missing space is probably the operating system and other hidden system files. 

A: Ok problem solved.
I repaired the disk using Disk Utility.app. Some blocks were not marked as free apparently!
