Q: Creating and deploying a standard build of OS X 10.6 company-wide My company is growing quickly and we are purchasing a lot of iMacs. Up until now each one has been configured individually but I'd like to be able to define default settings (network settings, Safari settings, dock settings etc) which I can apply automatically on a machine.
I'm assuming this can be done, but where do I start?

A: This is done using Apple Remote Desktop 3 and a Task Server(s). It's available in the Mac AppStore for $79.
Another useful and powerful software is DeployStudio, which automates disk image installation over a network.

A: See this question: OS X 10.6 : Automating new system provisioning with scripts. From my answer:

The IT department at my company
  maintains a disk image [on an external
  Firewire drive] with all of the
  settings in place they need to
  administer the Macs when they are
  received-including software in place
  registered with site licenses. They
  open the Macs and simply replace
  what's on the hard drive with the disk
  image.
