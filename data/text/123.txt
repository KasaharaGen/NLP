Q: How to disable syncing applications without uninstalling them? When I disable syncing apps with my iPad, iTunes uninstalls all apps. How can I make iTunes not mess with it and leave the apps on it, even if I disable synchronization?
I tried disconnecting immediately after applying, but this doesn't save the changes I made.

This also happens to my iPods and iPhones.

A: Alternatively you could select sync Apps but choose the applications you want in your iPad and uncheck the Automatically sync new apps. With this you will have only the applications that are selected.
