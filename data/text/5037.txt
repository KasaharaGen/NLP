Q: Free software for mounting an FTP share as a writeable folder in Finder Transmit and Forklift are paid, we can't use finder, macfusion doesn't work... so I'm wondering...
Is there any free option left to mount an FTP on finder so that I can write files to it? Maybe using scripts or automator? Maybe fixing my issue with macfusion? I don't even know why my installed macfuse is 2.1.7 (beta) while it asks me to "update" to 2.0.3 or, if I tick "Show Beta Versions", 2.1.5! In general, it looks to me the whole thing is too unstable yet.
Last case, I'll just stick with CyberDuck. And yes, I've  just tried them all except automator.

A: You could create a tiny Automator application to do the job.
Inside of Automator, add the following two actions to your workflow


*

*"Get specified servers"
Specify your server/servers in this action as follows: ftp://username:password@yourserver.com

*"Connect to servers"


(The names of the steps might not be a little off since I'm not running an English version of OS X)
Save this as an application and start it whenever you need. You can also make it a startup item in System Preferences > Account under the Startup items tab.
