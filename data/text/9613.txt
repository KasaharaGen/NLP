Q: Is there a CVS client for Mac OS X? Could anyone recommend me a free tool to use on OSX for keeping my CVS projects?
I am using the integrated SVN on OSX for all my SVN projects; maybe there are similar commands on the terminal to access a CVS repository.

A: I have /usr/bin/cvs, which has been installed together with Xcode; albeit, it might be Xcode 3.
just doing a check the file is still here under Mavericks and Xcode 5 and I have done clean upgrade since the original answer
