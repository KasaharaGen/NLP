Q: How do I restore a Windows 7 System Image to a OS X Lion Boot Camp partition? I just updated the hard drive in my MacBook Pro. I decided to also take the opportunity to upgrade it to Lion. I previously had Boot Camp under Snow Leopard. I created a new Boot Camp partition and went through Windows 7 installation. Now, I am trying to restore my previous Windows 7 system image. Windows restore seems to insist on wanting to format the entire drive though. Clearly I don't want to do this.
Is there any way to restore the image back into the Boot Camp partition?
I am willing to hack around the recovery console if necessary.

A: Winclone might be a good solution. 
Winclone allows you to image a Bootcamp partition and migrate it to a new Mac, or in this case a freshly installed OS on a new HD. Here's their tutorial: http://twocanoes.com/asset.php?id=9
