Q: How to choose Bluetooth controller in OS X Lion? My Mac Pro's internal bluetooth is broken. For the past 2 years, I've been getting by just fine with a USB Bluetooth adapter. I had to temporarily remove that adapter recently, and after putting it back I find that Lion has reverted to using the internal (broken!) adapter again.
Usually this is fixed simply by going into some utility program (Utilities -> Bluetooth Prefs?), which I no longer find in OS X.
Instead, I have only the System Preferences Bluetooth controls, and they do not allow me to specify the controller.  How can I choose the Bluetooth controller in OS X Lion?
