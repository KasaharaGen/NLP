Q: How to display Google App Contacts in a separate iChat list? I have a few accounts in iChat:


*

*GMail

*AIM

*Google Apps (a custom domain)


Both GMail and Google Apps put all my contacts in the 'Buddies' list. Can I rename my Gmail list to "GMail Contacts' or something else so that both accounts dont get merged?

A: I actually just tried this and iChat does it automatically. As you can see I have a different window for each account, and I think you can actually set the window's title by setting the account description under Settings->Accounts. As you can see I even have different groups for each account.  
Although I usually have them unified using Chax's feature Use All Contacts window as primary contact list

A: Yes, and Yes.  Just add a new group, and then drag your Google App contacts to the newly named group.  It's really that easy. You can right click on any group name, and select rename.
You can also do the same with Adium
