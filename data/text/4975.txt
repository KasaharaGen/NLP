Q: Who makes the Wifi component on the Macbook Pros? In Apple's Macbook line, who is actually making the Wifi components for them? Intel?
I ask because I've never had any trouble with wireless connections on my Macbook but all the adapters I buy for my PC seem to degrade quickly over time and I'd like to buy something along the lines of what Apple is putting in their machines.
