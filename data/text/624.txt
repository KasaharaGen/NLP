Q: Gmail on iPhone app : pictures broken The native Gmail iPhone 4 app on my phone behaves weird, it is not showing pictures that come as attachment, when I click on the picture it starts downloading the picture but it displays those classic picture not available pic with a question mark. I tried deleting account and adding it again still no luck.. 
Any clue?
I'm on iOS 4.1  

A: I haven't found anything that officially says there's an iPhone file-size limitation, but I have noticed that over 3G, some larger pictures will not download to my mailbox. Try over WiFi or get 3G Unrestrictor and see what happens.
