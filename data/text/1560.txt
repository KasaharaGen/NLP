Q: What are your "must-have" MacPorts? I hate to be all clich√© with yet another "best [something]" question, but I am genuinely interested in what you most often install with MacPorts. When you get a new Mac, which ports do you first install?
So far, I've installed wget and watch, since I find those to be very useful on Linux machines. I also installed wine and winetricks to run a Windows program or two. And earlier today I started playing with Scala, so I installed the scala28 port.
Tip: to see your installed ports, use the port installed command.

A: I just compile from source, since all of the important programs build easily on Mac OS X these days. Here's a great article on the advantages of building your own stuff vs. using package managers.
Having said that, here's my quick list:


*

*Mercurial 

*Git

*GNU Privacy
Guard 1.4.x

*ffmpeg

*MySQL Best directions I've seen for building 32 or 64-bit MySQL on Mac OS X:
DIYMacServer

A: In no particular order:


*

*git - git

*signing-party - GnuPG key signing utils, pulls in GnuPG as well

*ntop - A Unix tool that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does.

*sslscan - sslscan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the ciphers that are supported

*watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen

*nmap - Network port scan to see what ports are open

*coreutils GNU coreutils. Includes gnu versions of basic unix commands, including "color ls" (gls) 

*pstree - Process tree listing 

*tcping - tcp
based network connectivity checker
(like ping but with TCP for when ICMP
is blocked) 

*wget - non-interactive
network downloader. Supports http,
https and ftp

*apg - Automated Password Generator - toolset for generating random passwords


A: First thing I do is update to the latest bash version... then I usually grab some updated versions of utilities:


*

*grep

*sudo

*man

*info (although i had to go with the fink version for this, macports is bugged)

*gdiff


Then on to my development tools like subversion, git, vim, macvim, python3, etc.  I heart MacPorts :P

A: *

*bash

*bash-completion (very important)

*nmap

*file


A: *

*wget : is command-line that allow me to retrieve any file using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP. 

*tree : displays a tree-view of my directories & files, with deep-level option.


You can participate with your MacPorts by typing : 

port installed requested


A: The Google CL tools are cool and useful (I do a lot with Docs).
