Q: How can I scroll down to the bottom of document (HTML) in Safari? I normally can use Command-DownArrow, to go to the bottom of the document in text editor such as TextMate.
How can I do the same thing in Safari? How can I scroll down to the bottom of the document with Safari when I read the long HTML document?
And, how can I scroll one screen with keyboard?

A: Command ⌘ + Down ↓ or Function (Fn) + Right → should both work.
Fn Right is the built-in key combination that is most equivalent to the End key.
