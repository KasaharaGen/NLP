Q: Is there any way to open a recently closed tab in Safari in iOS? Is there a way to open a recently closed tab in the Safari browser in iOS? I am specifically looking for a solution that works on the iPad.
For reference, here is this question for the Mac.

A: Yes. Hold down on the + icon that you use to open a new tab in the upper right corner of Safari and you'll be presented with a list of recently closed tabs. Pick one to re-open. 
As far as I know this is an iOS 5+ feature, iPad only.
