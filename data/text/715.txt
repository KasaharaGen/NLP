Q: Run Keynote Presentation in a Window Is there a way to run a Keynote presentation in a window instead of fullscreen?  I changed the resolution to one smaller than my display, and it displays it centered.  I need it in the upper left corner of the screen to record it with Camtasia.

A: The latest update of keynote allow you to do play the presentation in a window.
Upgrade your keynote to 10.1 and simply play your slideshow via play-> play slideshow in screen.

10.1Jul 9, 2020 • Use the new “Play Slideshow in Window” option to have access to other applications while presenting locally or via
video conferencing.


A: You can export it as a QuickTime movie and choose the Manual Advance Playback mode. It will behave exactly as a Presentation (click to advance and so on) and you will not loose any of the effects (animations, transitions, etc).
Once you have it in Quicktime then you can just present it in a window. Make sure you select Full Quality so you get the best possible movie out.
