Q: Full virtual desktop on iPad with sound Is there an iPad app that allows me to use a desktop game with an important audio component? I'm looking for a pleasurable music-like experience on the iPad.

A: Splashtop supports audio redirection (from the desktop to the iPad), however it requires running the Splashtop Streamer on your Mac.

A: While you play any game on the iPad, you can also play any song or playlist in your iTunes  song library at the same time, in the background.
