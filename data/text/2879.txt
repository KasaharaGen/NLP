Q: Adjusting the scale in GarageBand track visualization? I've recorded some audio from an external mic and an acoustic guitar with a mic. I can hear it just fine when I play it back, but in the visualization it is almost invisible. There are just some really small bumps on the otherwise straight line. 
Is it possible to adjust the scale of the visualization?

A: If you double click the track it will open the track editor which is a larger view that can be adjusted. Other than that I don't think GarageBand has that ability (unlike Logic).

A: I think you're running on the same problem that I faced when I asked this question. You don't have a visualization problem, but maybe a input level problem.
