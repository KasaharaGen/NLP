Q: How can I use shortcut keys for context menu items? A common workflow on a Windows or Linux PC is to right click on a link in (say) Chrome, then hit "L" to copy the URL to the clipboard.
How can I achieve this on MacOS?  I don't want to have to use the mouse to select the relevant menu item.

A: Context menus can be navigated in Safari with keyboard shortcuts. E.g pressing C - Enter will jump to copy link.
