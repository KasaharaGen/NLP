Q: How to disable CMD+Q combination? I am using WinOS at the office and MacOS at home. But I am more experienced on WinOS. While i am browsing (via Firefox), I use ⌘ CMD+Q accidentally to write "@" mark because of WinOS and keyboard habits. So, the browser quits and I lose all what I've written.
Is there a way to constrain this key combination on MacOS or do I have to look for it on Firefox? (I know, the best way is adapting MacOS but mostly I am working on WinOS.)

A: Unfortunately, Firefox (at least the 3.6 version I experimented with) does not disable the command shortcut for Quit when you change it in System Preferences.
I think the quick and easy fix for this is to add ⌘Q as a global shortcut to something else innocuous. In my experiments, I found this to work:


*

*Open System Preferences.

*Click on the Keyboard pane.

*Click Keyboard Shortcuts tab.

*Click Exposé & Spaces shortcuts in the left side list.

*Under "Exposé" change the shortcut for "Desktop" to ⌘Q


Now when you accidentally hit ⌘Q, your desktop will magically and amusingly appear reminding you of your folly. Hit ⌘Q again and you're back exactly where you were.
As a sidenote, after a while you may want to change this back after you "unlearn" your behaviour. ⌘Q, the Mac equivalent to "ALT-F4" has been the standard shortcut since the introduction of the Macintosh, and like the other "standard" shortcuts ⌘W,⌘Z,⌘C,⌘V and so on, it's best to learn them to ease use of other Mac computers or when you upgrade.

A: Here's how to change that particular shortcut for Firefox:


*

*Open System Preferences. This is in the Applications folder.

*Go to the Keyboard pane, and click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.

*Click the [+] button near the bottom.

*Select Firefox from the Application menu. For Menu Title, type 'Quit Firefox' (without the quotes)

*For the Keyboard Shortcut, push a key combination that you're not likely to hit by accident (control-q, for example).

*Open Firefox. Now, cmd-q does nothing (you can quit with ctrl-q, or whatever you set it to).


Hope this helps.

A: I'm on macOS Ventura and I need to remove the “Close Window” shortcut Cmd+W, as I often accidentally close an app.
The way to do it is to find out the exact specific command in the menu bar. In my case, it is called “Close”.
Then go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts then click + to add a new shortcut for the app. Next, reassign an obscure keyboard shortcut (for me Ctrl+Option+Cmd+W).
