Q: Can a MacBook act as bluetooth headset? Is it possible to use my MacBook as a bluetooth headset? I would like to connect my phone to my MacBook via bluetooth, so that when calls or SMS come into my phone I get notified on my MacBook, and ideally be able to read the SMS and reply, and talk and listen to the calls through my MacBook.
Is this possible using bluetooth? Or even better using WiFi?

A: Get Phone Amego from the Mac AppStore. I was looking for the same thing this morning and it worked great! It was very easy to setup.

A: You can do it. There is an app called BluePhoneElite. With it, you can receive and send call, sms. You can even import and save your call lists and sms.
But it was discontinued. You can get it at Softpedia.

A: I haven't tested this, but I've heard that Phonecall Wizard can do this from a thread  on Apple Support Communities: Can my Mac act as a Bluetooth headset?
As for over Wi-Fi...I doubt it. For Android, it wouldn't be too hard to make such an application, but I failed to find one. For iOS, there's no chance when you consider Apple's strict guidelines for App Store applications.

A: Was searching for this for the new Nokia 3310, and got to find HandsFree 2 which worked.
Though Phone Amigo works, but don't seem stable and quite expensive.
