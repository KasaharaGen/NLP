Q: Is there any way to bring back H.264 support in Chromium I'm using Chrome on a daily basis or to be exact, latest-builds of Chromium. I recently uninstalled Flash, in order to increase battery life on my MBP and in general rid my laptop of the evil Flash imply.
Now with Chromium's drop of H.264 codec support, enjoying the web is becoming harder and harder. Is there any way to re-enable H.264 support in Chromium? 
I know Microsoft (of all players) released such a codec plugin for Chrome recently. Safari isn't really an option although it's sweet.

A: While announced in January, Chrome hasn't actually dropped support for H264 yet.

A: There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this. I first thought the following steps would solve the problem, but alas no!


*

*Download and install Google Chrome v40.0.2214.91 from http://google-chrome.en.uptodown.com/mac/old

*In Applications, CTRL-click on the Google Chrome icon and select Show Package Contents

*Go to /Contents/Versions/40.0.2214.91 which contains Google Chrome Framework.framework

*In the Finder, change to list view if you haven't already, so that you can see which files and folders are contained in the above framework

*Copy the file ffmpegsumo.so from the Libraries folder and paste in the the corresponding folder of your Chromium app

*Uninstall Google Chrome

*Restart Chromium


I have found that some users have been successful using the Chromium Embedded Framework. Follow this link to head to a post on the forum detailing how to build CEF with support for proprietary codecs (namely H.264 and MP3).
On Mac, prior to building CEF by running the automated script automate-git.py, open the Terminal and set the GPY_DEFINES variable as follows:
export GYP_DEFINES="proprietary_codecs=1 ffmpeg_branding=Chrome"

Instructions explaining how to build the CEF may be found here.
