Q: iPod Touch can't download apps Since yesterday, my first-generation iPod Touch would not let me download apps. In the app store, the image description (the one that you can slide left and right) would not appear and was replaced by small rectangles. The [free] or [0.99] button does not respond.
My iPod Touch is not jailbroken, and is updated with the latest firmware (3.1).
How can I fix this issue?

A: I've experienced similar problems in the past and it tends to be fixed by force quitting the app, by double tapping the home button so the multi-tasking tray appears, holding down the app until the red 'x' appears and then tapping that before opening the app store again.
