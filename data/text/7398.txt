Q: Is there a way to reduce the opening tab of safari When opening a new tab or window in Safari, sometimes the address field is selected, and sometimes it isn't. If it's not, there's no way to tab to it. Is there a way to make the bar always selected by default?

A: There is no setting to do this but if you press Command+L the cursor will move to the address bar.
