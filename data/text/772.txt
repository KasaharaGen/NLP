Q: Is there an app that will scan a document and upload it to Google Docs? Is there an iPhone app that allows me to take pictures of documents and then upload them to Google Docs?

A: Scanner Pro [iTunes link] from Readdle. According to the product's Web page, it integrates with Google Docs and

lets you use Google Docs OCR to convert scans into editable text files on your Google account.
