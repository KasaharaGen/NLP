Q: Free (if possible) Video Converter I've been getting along with VisualHub (defunct) for a while now, but recently I've needed an expanded set of Codec's, in particular Theora and VP8.1

A: FFmpeg might be what you're looking for. It is free and supports Theora and VP8.

A: A couple free programs:


*

*Miro Video Converter - Free but very limited in terms of customization. But does support Theora and VP8l

*FFMPEG on the command line - Harder to use but it's free.

*Video Monkey - Based on the open sourced replacement of Visual Hub
