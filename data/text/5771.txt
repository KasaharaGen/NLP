Q: Connect to Linux File System with default "Connect to Server"? I'm wondering what kind of setup I need on my Linux machine to be able to connect to it using the default "Connect to Server" (command + k) in OSX. I'm going to ask this on askubuntu as well, but I want to see if anyone here knows the server connection types that the default file connections in OSX are? 
I only want to change my server setup, not install anything new on my OSX machine. Thanks!

A: You need to set up either nfs, samba, or netatalk. You can then connect with nfs://, smb:// (or cifs://) or afp:// respectively.
You can also run avahi for to have your server show up automatically in the Finder via Bonjour.
