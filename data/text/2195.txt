Q: snow leopard(10.6.5)freezes on startup with bootcamp and windows7 Help! I've installed boot camp and Windows 7 on my black Macbook Santa Rosa (2.4Ghz, 4GB RAM) and have a serious problem where I can no longer boot into OSX.
OSX freezes with the apple logo and timer, but also has an extra progress bar that I have not seen before.
Has anyone else encountered or heard of this problem?
This is the second time that this exact thing has happened (the last time I just reinstalled everything, as I wanted to increase the size of the windows partition anyway), but really don't have the time to go through all of that again.
The first time that this happened, I ran disk utility from the Snow Leopard disk, and attempted to verify permissions and disk but to no avail.
Any help would be most appreciated...

A: Can you start it in Safe Mode?

A: did you fix the problem in the end? I just had exactly the same problem.
Been working in windows 7 (64 bit) all day while using MacDrive to access the project files I was working on from the mac partition. Tried to boot back into mac os and had exactly the same problem.
Wasn't sure if it was windows 7 or MacDrive breaking things...
