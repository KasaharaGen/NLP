Q: How can I turn off the photo preview when I plugin in my iPhone on my PC? When I plug in my iPhone 3GS into my Windows XP machine, it automatically opens up Word and displays a preview of all my photos from my phone.
I believe I may have accidentally selected an option to always do that. How do I turn it off?


A: *

*Connect your phone to the computer.

*In Windows, click Start > Settings > Control Panel > Scanners and Cameras.

*Right-click on "Apple iPhone" > Properties.

*Click the tab "Events".

*Click the radio button "Take no action". Then OK.


Now when you connect the phone, nothing should happen.
