Q: Are there any GameBoy Advance emulators for OS X Lion? As a prior Windows user, on the Mac I miss some popular video game console emulators like VisualBoyAdvance or ZSNES. Especially the lack of a good Game Boy Advance emulator is bugging me.
So my question is: Is there a good GBA emulator out for OS X Lion? No PPC apps please.

A: Here are some references. I don't have any personal experience with them.

Richard Bannister's BSNES for Mac OS X. A note there indicates that it is not yet compiled for Lion.

A: I thought I should provide a 2016 answer, since I had the same question. I downloaded Boycott Advance from emuparadise and it works like a charm.
It will download a .zip file, unzip it and just double click on the Boycott Advance file you will see.
Now, given that you already have a ROM downloaded, I had leafGreen..... go to the Boycott Advance toolbar (on the top of the screen) and click File -> Open and select your ROM, and you be fine! Have fun... :)

In case you are good in Pokemon, contact me (see my profile) for a battle in the online simulator Pokemon Showdown (it's really simple, you just assemble your team, give me your username in Showdown and I will challenge you)!
