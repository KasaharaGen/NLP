Q: How do I make a certain keyboard command system wide? I'm using WireTap to record some documentary while I need to frequently make cue mark command (Command-Shift-T). 
And the way I do is first use Command-Tab to switch to Wire Tap and hit Command-Shift-T, and then switch back to the player which is very annoying.
Is there a way to make the command system wide?

A: Keyboard Maestro is a very powerful and easy to use keyboard macro app. If you want a multi-step process available everywhere on your Mac you can't do much better.
By "multi-step process" I mean, to use your example, no matter what app I'm using right now, pressing a certain key combination performs these steps.

*Quickly switch to the Wire Tap app.

*Press CmdShiftT in the Wire Tap app.

*Quickly switch back to whatever app you were previously in.


This all happens so quickly that you can barely tell any app switching occurred.
I use it to start and stop my time tracking app at the press of a keystroke, for instance, as well as ensuring that Cmd+ zooms in no matter what graphics app I'm using and Cmd- zooms out.

A: I think you are looking for Spark. It's a great (free!!) hot key manager for OS X. I have found it to be very useful. I don't exactly understand what you want to make system wide, but if you'll edit your question to clarify what you mean, I can give you more help with setting up the hot keys.
