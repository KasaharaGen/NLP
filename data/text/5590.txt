Q: Can Aperture auto-delete photos after import from an iPhone I'm trying out Aperture to see whether I should upgrade from iPhoto. I take a lot of photos on my iPhone and have always imported, then deleted these using iPhoto. After importing photos from my photo with Aperture I didn't get an option to delete the originals from the phone. Am I missing a config option somewhere, or does Aperture not offer this functionality? 

A: Aperture does not seem to offer this functionality for the iPhone. So after importing it does not give you the option.

But after importing you can always use Image Capture to delete the photos in one go:
