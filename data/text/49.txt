Q: How to minimize all windows/applications to the dock? ⌥+⌘+M as mentioned in multiple docs only appears to minimize the current (focused) window.
I am looking for the "Show Desktop" equivalent.  If it matters I'm using 10.6.4.  

A: I just use Hot Corners to do it.   
System Preferences >> Desktop & Screen Saver >> Hot Corners >> Select "Desktop" from one of the dropdowns. I use the bottom left, since that's where I was used to the Desktop button in XP lol. 

A: ⌥+⌘+M actually minimizes all windows of a current application, not just the current focused window (unless of course, the application you have running only has one non-minimized window.)
The easiest way to hide all active applications is to select the Finder/Desktop, and then "Hide Others." The keyboard shortcut is ⌥+⌘+H.
You can also simply hold ⌥ and ⌘ and click on the Desktop, or Finder on the Dock, or of course, simply use Expose and hit F11 (Or whatever you've rebound Hide-all to.)

A: I finally found how to do it with Command+Option+H+M.
This works for me on Mac OS X Lion.
