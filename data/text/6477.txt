Q: doubt regarding calibration I have white MacBook (early 2009), with Snow Leopard running.
I read this following article about calibration: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/9036.html
I have doubt in step 2
It says "Allow the battery to rest in the fully charged state for two hours or longer.", with subnote as "You can use your computer during this time as long as the power adapter is plugged in."
If I don't want to use computer after fully charging it, should I turn off and remove MagSafe Power Adapter or should I keep it on for 2 hours?
Please help.

A: Keep the magsafe in for 2 hours, whether it's on or sleeping.
