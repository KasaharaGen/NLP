Q: How to customize Textmate keybindings? I'm trying to customize Textmate's keybindings. I edited 'KeyBindings.dict' in Content/Resources/ and then restarted textmate. It does not work.
Is three an easy way to customize keybindings?

A: MacroMates has an article on keybindings for TextMate on their site.
