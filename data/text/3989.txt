Q: Disappearing error message and Safari windows When I close my laptop I have it set to automatically log me off. I closed my laptop while I still had some Safari browser windows open along with my iTunes. 
When i opened it, I logged back on. I moved into my space with my Safari browsers, however I could not interact with any of them. When changing spaces and then coming back to it, I saw an window pop-up asking me if I wanted to quit Safari and all 4 browsers that very quickly disappeared. 
I did not want to quit Safari, but because it disappeared so fast all I could do was change spaces to make it reappear and then press enter to make it go away, and lose my browsers. 
Why did this happen and how can I prevent it?
