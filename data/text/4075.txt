Q: Unset Fn Key Activating Expose When I first got my Macbook Pro, I somewhere came across a setting that let me map the Fn key to the same action as the 'F3' command, which I guess is the 'Expose' feature where it shows all open windows.
Since that was set, I've been unable to find where to UNset it, because now I'm unable to use Fn + Function Key to activate F1, F2, etc.
I've checked the Keyboard preferences, but all Expose options show they are mapped to the usual F1-12 keys, with no reference anywhere to Fn.
I've also clicked the Reset to Defaults button there, but no change.
Any ideas where I can find this?

A: If I open "Expose & Spaces" preference panel,  I see an option to select the "fn" key to different Expose actions.  This is on 10.6.
