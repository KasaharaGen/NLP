Q: How to access windows shared directory for music files? I would like to access music files on windows from my iPad.
Is it possible? I really don't think it is a good idea to transfer music files to my ipad since I use ipad at home anyway.

A: If you're using iTunes on Windows, I think you can just use playlist sharing?
If you're looking to access a directory that's shared from Windows, you'll need to find a utility for your iPad that supports Samba (SMB), as that's the protocol in use for file sharing on Windows.

A: Two apps designed for iPhone, but can run on iPad:


*

*SMB Lite - free, but file size limited

*SMB Music - paid
