Q: OS X Lion: Authorization Plugins I tried to install an authorization plugin on mac OS X 10.7 that previously worked on Snow Leopard but all I'm getting is a white screen with the cursor. Did something happen to authorization plugins in Lion? Is there a way to fix this?
PS. Something definitely changed considering the way it looks now.

A: Removing all the custom GUI from the plugin solved the problem
