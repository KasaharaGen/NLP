Q: Mac Apps Store wont download any apps on computer I have successfully downloaded apps on a laptop, but when trying to download on a desktop mac, whenever i click install, it says 'put password for billing info', as it would normally. I do so, click enter, and nothing happens.  No error message, nothing.

A: Try signing out of your iTunes account then signing back in.
