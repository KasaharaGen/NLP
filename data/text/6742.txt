Is is possible to have two pointers on the same computer? I was working on a project with a friend and it would've been really nice to have two pointers. Note that I am not asking how to connect two mice to a computer, I want two pointers on the same computer.

A: You can connect multiple mice to share the same pointer.
Multiple pointers is a bit different, research and development is still ongoing in the Linux world that you may wish to peruse for information:
Video example of using multiple pointers:
