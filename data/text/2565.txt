Q: How to set a refresh rate in a Subscribed Calendar using the ical on the iPhone / iPod Touch / iPad how can I set the refresh rate?
or does it pick the refresh rate that I had set up in the Mac iCal App?
If no refresh rate was given in the Mac iCal App, what is the default refresh rate? 30 minutes?

A: In "Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Fetch New Data" you can setup what to do. Depending on the account you can Fetch or Push updates to your iPhone - or choose to do it manually.

A: As of 2019/iOS 12.3.1, these settings are under Passwords and Accounts → Fetch New Data → Fetch. It looks like fetch settings are applied globally to all fetch accounts - you can't set different fetch options for individual calendars or mail accounts.

A: When viewing Calendar, click on Calendars button in top left.
Down at bottom left corner you'll see the refresh circular arrow.  Click it and it will refresh all subscribed calendars.

A: I can't find any option to set refresh rate's of calendars on my iPhone.
I checked my Google Calendar subscription in iCal and it had refresh of 15 minutes as default value. This value might vary depending on the provider of the calendar.
But AFAIK, calendars on iPhone don't refresh unless synced from iTunes.
