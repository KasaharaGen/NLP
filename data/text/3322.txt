Q: How can I change the preferred application for opening "fmp7://" URLs from FileMaker Pro Advanced to FileMaker Pro? I have both FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced installed. Because the available licenses for the Advanced product are limited, I shouldn't use it unless necessary. But when neither application is running, my Mac will currently open any "fmp7://" URLs in FileMaker Pro Advanced. How do I change this so that FileMaker Pro is opened instead?
(There's no obvious configuration option for this in either application's Preferences window.)

A: Download and install the excellent RCDefaultApp Preference Pane, which — amongst other things —  lets you declare the default handler for fmp7:// URLs.
