Q: How can I check a video file has an alpha channel? I have a bunch of video files (FLV and MOV), some with alpha channels and some without.
How can I efficiently know the ones that have an alpha channel?

A: Exiftool should report all clips with alpha channels as 32 bit:
exiftool -bitdepth /path/to/your/movie.mov

You can of course specify wildcards when calling exiftool:
exiftool -bitdepth *.mov

Media Inspector may do this as well if you prefer a GUI app.

A: Another way is to use ffprobe. Here is an example adapted from this answer, to show it for every .mov file in the current directory:

for f in *.mov; do
    pixfmt=$(ffprobe -v 0 -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=pix_fmt -of compact=p=0:nk=1 "$f")
    alpha=$(ffprobe -v 0 -show_entries pixel_format=name:flags=alpha -of compact=p=0  | grep "$pixfmt|" | grep -oP "(?<=alpha=)\d")
    if (( alpha )); then
        echo "With alpha: $f"
    else
        echo "no : $f"
    fi
done

See the original answer for details on how it works.
