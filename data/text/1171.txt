Q: Client torrent for broadcatching I would like to drop Vuze that I've been running for many years now on my G4 Mac mini in favor of a more lightweight torrent client.
These two features are mandatory:


*

*Watched folder

*RSS scanner for automatic downloads 


Any recommendation?

A: I use Automatic (I use 1.x version, which was free, I see there’s version 2.x which is a paid update and I didn’t know about. My 1.x works ok), Transmission for the download (it monitors the files that Automatic downloads from a RSS feed I’ve created using ShowRSS (free).
