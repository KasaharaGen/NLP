Q: How to fix SMS app showing no message even though they are available through Spotlight? I was composing an SMS message and then I tapped on send button. This message was composed for group of 50 persons. It started sending messages in background and I could hear the sound of sending messages one by one.
Suddenly while sending messages, the Springboard crashed. It displayed me three options: "OK", "Restart", "Help". I tapped on "OK" and restarted SMS app to view SMS. But I found everything empty in SMS application and messages were still being sent from my phone in the background. 
I got frustrated and I connected the iPhone to my computer, it started synchronizing and synchronized the empty SMSs.
I am able to search all of my previous messages from Spotlight search, but when I select a message from search results of spotlight, it redirects me to SMS application and application shows nothing.
Even in SMS application, I can search for messages and I can find the previous messages as a search result but I can't open them.
How can I get back my messages?

A: I think you must restore your iPhone from a iOS backup! But than you will lost your last changes.
