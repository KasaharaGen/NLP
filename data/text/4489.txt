Q: Mac not searching my files Today I started my Mac (iMac) and when I tried to search in finder or spotlight it produce no results. I think its related to the search cache. I guess it gets corrupted. If this is the case How can I regenerate the cache or fix this issue. 

A: To display the status of indexing
# mdutil -s /
To clear the metadata store
Turn indexing off for /
# mdutil -i off /
Clear the metadata store for /
# mdutil -E /
Turn indexing back on for /
# mdutil -i on /


A: My suggestion is to rebuild the Spotlight index.  The easiest way to do that is a freeware app called Onyx.  It also clears caches and performs a number of mac maintenance items.  Search online for Onyx, install the app and click execute the "Automation" tab and let us know how you made out.
