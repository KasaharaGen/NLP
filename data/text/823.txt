Q: In Pages, What is this Line Under a Rectangle Shape? There is a persistent thing going on in Pages where there is a line under a rectangle shape when I make it. How do I get rid of it? I don't want it to show up when I export the document to a PDF.


A: Simple.  Make sure you've selected the object you want to remove the line from.  Click your inspector, and navigate over to the graphic tab (see screenshot).  select none.  Last screenshot shows the result.
