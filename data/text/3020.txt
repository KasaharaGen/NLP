Q: Is there an iPad PDF Reader app that has autoscroll? I read stacks of PDFs on my iPad and I have downloaded (and paid for) a few PDF readers hoping to find an auto-scroll feature, without luck.
Does anyone know of any iPad app that can auto-scroll PDF's (preferably with Dropbox integration so I can get at my PDFs easily!).
Thanks

A: To date, I have found only one PDF reader that has Dropbox connectivity and has autoscroll(after a fashion.)
It is PDF Reader Pro iTunes Link. It is a universal app that works on both iPad and iPhone and ties to Box.net, Dropbox, Googledocs, and iDisk.  It has an "Autoflow" feature that allows timed jumps (from 5 to 100 seconds) of a preset number of pixels (20 to 400.)  I bought it at the low price of $0.99 and it performs, pretty much, as expected.  It has some basic annotation capabilities and "scans" documents using the camera in the iPad 2.  I have an original so I couldn't test that feature.
I haven't used it a lot as I like the annotative capabilities of iAnnotate, but the app is a good fall back if I need the autoflow feature.
For $0.99 it looks to be a solid reader that fits the requirements you laid out.

A: I think GoodReader (iTunes Link) is right up your alley.
It supports PDFs primarily, but according to it's site also supports Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, HTML WebArchive, images/audio/video files.
It can connect to Dropbox shares, download resources directly off the web (and some other protocols, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV) in-app, supports Document Sharing (file loading via iTunes), features autoscroll, and many many more features and customizations that you didn't ask about!
It is unfortunately NOT a Universal app, USD$5 for the iPad version. And another USD$5 should you ever want to buy it for an iPhone/iPod.

A: If good reader has PDF autoscroll I haven't found it.
What it CAN do is extract text from a PDF, display it
as if it were plain text, and autoscroll that.

A: Try Filemagnet!  You can control autoscroll with the tilt of your device.
