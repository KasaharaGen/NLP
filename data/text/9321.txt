Q: windows like (context menu) unzipper in mac? Is there an app that acts like windows-based unzipper?
I don't want my unarchiver unzip when I click a zipped file. I rather want to right click then click 'unzip' or something similar.
Update: I think people are getting confused. I know that I can unzip a file simply by double clicking it. I DON'T WANT THAT. I like to have a context menu like windows application. Is this possible?

A: You can make an automator service that sends the selected file to Archive Utility.app (found in /System/CoreServices) and make it into a contextual menu item

A: Unarchiving is built into OS X. All you have to do to unarchive a file is to open it. You can do that by double clicking, pressing cmd+o (between i and p), or by right-clicking and choosing Open.

So, just right-click on the file and select Open to unarchive. Ta-da, no extra software required.

A: No, there is nothing like that on the Mac platform that I am aware of.
I believe what Moon is going on about is that in the Windows Explorer, it's possible to do more with .zip archives than what the Mac Finder lets you do. In the Windows Explorer you can use a contextual menu command to inspect an archive with multiple items inside and see those items listed before you decide whether you want to extract anything or not. You can extract only certain items within an archive without extracting the entire archive. No, there's no way to get that kind of flexibility in the Mac Finder. 
Using the contextual menu in the Finder on Mac OS X, you can either extract the entire contents of a .zip file, or nothing.
