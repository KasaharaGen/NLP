How can I find more disk space? 

Is there a program or app that i can use to tell me where all of my hard disk space has gone? I'd like a graph (pie chart) if possible, but I prefer free/low cost over the aesthetics of such a program.

A: Disk Inventory X is a great tool for this. While its not a pie chart, it is a visual graph of your usage, as well as relative sizes to other files. Colors are also used to group like files together. I have used this a few times to find what was using up extra disk space. 
Its free too. 

A: DaisyDisk should suit your needs. It costs $19, but has a free trial available. Paying for the app gives you: 


*

*No "nag-screens", badges or overlays

*All functions, including the in-app deletion, are available

*Free updates

*Priority support by e-mail

*One license can be used on multiple Macs


So registering isn't exactly required and there isn't a time limit, but there are some features that you don't get with the free version.

A: I've been using GrandPerspective for several years now and been very happy.

A: WhatSize is my tool of choice and has a free trial. If I didn't need the extra functionality it allows, I would also check out a free trial of DaisyDisk. Although it's more focused on pretty animations and presentation than full function (at this point in it's life), there are advantages to getting DaisyDisk through the Mac App Store. GrandPerspective makes my head hurt but I know many people who swear by it instead of at it.
