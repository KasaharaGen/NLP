Q: How to connect to a FTP server from a Wi-Fi Hotspot that prevents direct FTP connections? I am using the wifi at a library where they prevent me to connect to FTP servers for some reason. I need to upload my work.
Is there any tool or trick to go around this?

A: I actually have found one solution:
net2ftp - a web based FTP client
Usual warnings concerning (non-)confidentiality of data etc. apply.

A: You can do it by connecting directly via Internet Explorer.
 You just have to tap in the url : ftp://ftp.yourwebsite.com / Then enter your password and that's it. 
But it can only be a temporary solution because I don't think it's really safe to do it that way ...
