Q: Disable resume for all apps I would like to disable resume for all applications  by default (including newly install applications).
I know the following command will disable resume for a specific application (Safari in this case) 
defaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false but I was wondering if there's a way to disable it permanently.

A: Uncheck Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps under System Preferences -> General.
In Mountain Lion, this option has been changed to read, Close windows when quitting an application with fine print to explain that open documents will not be restored.

A: To disable resume for all applications permanently, in the Finder, press Shift-Command-G to "Go to the folder" ~/Library/Saved Application State/, then press Command-I to Get file info, and check the "locked" box to lock the folder. This will keep any newly installed applications from resuming.

A: Or use the Resuminator app:

Allows both fine tuning or global toggle of Resume.
