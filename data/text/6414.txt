Q: Is there any way to get the Multi-Safari version of Safari 2 working on Snow Leopard? Michel Fortin’s Multi-Safari actually makes it possible to test websites in old versions of Safari, should you feel the need.
Unfortunately, the Multi-Safari version of Safari 2 doesn’t quite work properly in Snow Leopard. For me, it worked for a few minutes. Then, for no apparent reason, it stopped loading web pages — the progress bar would stay stuck at a fairly short length, and the status bar would say it was waiting for the web site.
Is there any way to get it working reliably on Snow Leopard?

A: Safari 2, sorry, why would you need to test for that? It's REALLY not in use by anyone anymore. 
Anyway, the best way I can think of running it is to virtualise an earlier version of OS X - Tiger or Jaguar.
