Q: Purchased new MacBook Pro on 16th October 2011; question about Up-To-Date program I purchased a new MBP and am eligible for their free Lion upgrade program; I applied for it but it would take anywhere between 5-7 business days for my country. If I purchase Lion now, will I get a refund after entering update code into iTunes?

A: Probably not, but you should contact Apple in your country to get a definitive answer.

A: I got confirmation of refund from apple and it seems that this is possible to do if you explain your situation well enough.
