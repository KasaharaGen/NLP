Q: Displaying minimised windows When I minimize safari, finder or Firefox windows, they move down to the dock. When I use Command + Tab , to move back to them, the minimized windows don't appear, just the top menu bar is changed. I have to click on the docked thumbnail to maximize particular window. Is it possible to maximize windows with only command + tab.
thanks

A: *

*Use Command-Tab to tab to the app as usual

*Before releasing the Command key, press Option as well

*Release Command and Tab

*Release Option
Doing it is actually easier than explaining it, so just give it a try!

A: It's not the nicest way in the world, but Ctrl + F3 allows you to move along your Dock icons with the keyboard arrows, then Enter/Return will bring it back up. 
Oh, just found a nicer way through, Tab through to the app you want, then hold Option on your keyboard and it'll bring the window back up. Not sure if that'll work for every app, but it worked in Skype & Safari. Details on Lifehacker.
