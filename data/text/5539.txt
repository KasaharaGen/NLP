Q: Is there an AppleScript or Automator action to quickly edit Info for Video in iTunes? I ripped the DVD set of a television series to my iMac. But now, the filenames are weird and there is no meta info. 
In Automator, I see there is an action to edit Info for a song. That's great, but it doesn't really work for TV Shows - it won't handle the stuff that you'd see in the "Video" tab when viewing Info in iTunes.
Is there an Automator action for this that I can use? If not, AppleScript?

A: It's possible on iTunes, here's a example
tell application "iTunes"
    repeat with i in (get selection)
        tell i
            set episode number to 1
            set episode ID to "blah"
            set season number to 1
            set show to "blah"
        end tell
    end repeat
end tell


A: If your files are MP4s, you can use MetaX for this.
