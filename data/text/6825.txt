Q: Why is iPhoto changing the titles of my photos after uploading the files to Flickr? After uploading photos to Flickr via the iPhoto "share" button, I find that iPhoto renames the photo titles to whatever I have in the description field. It'll then pass along those changes to Flickr. 
I like to change my titles to something short before uploading, but this overrides either my custom titles or the ones the camera assigns.  
Does anyone know how to turn this "feature" off? I'm using iPhoto 9.1.5 (that's iPhoto '11) under OSX 10.6.8. 


A: I don't think this can be turned off. Another effect this has is that if you delete a photo in iPhoto, it also gets removed from Flickr.
To avoid this, i use Flickr's free Uploadr rather than the built in tool. This lets you select the photos, give custom names, etc. It's easy to use, and if you make changes to the photos in iPhoto, there will be no effect on the images on Flickr.
