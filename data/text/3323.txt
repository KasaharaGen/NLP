Q: AppleScript "Open With..." icon I've written an AppleScript app that I use to open certain files with (it sends them to Vim in the Terminal). 
I'd like to set all my .Tex files to automatically open with this app. The problem is this changes the files icons to the blank file icon.
Is there a way to change the app's icon? In other apps I use (non-AppleScript apps) I know how to "change" this icon by replacing it in foo.app/contents/resources but in my app there is no icon there yet. 
Is it possible to add one?

A: See this answer and this answer of mine on SuperUser, where I explain how to create new or edit existing file types, including icons.

A: You can create an icon file named droplet.icns inside the app package inside foo.app/Contents/Resources/.
