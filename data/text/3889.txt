The apple site shows that it's using 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 2x2GB ram. Would the 1600 ram work as an upgrade or would it be incompatible? And what's the speed difference between the two, is it noticeable?
Thanks.

A: *

*Those are desktop DIMMs, you want the laptop DIMMs.
Try this search instead. or this search which starts a the Mac search below.

*1600 would work, but it wouldn't be
much faster as they would run at the lower frequency, but might have better latency.
