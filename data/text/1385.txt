Q: Why is the wireless connection between my MacBook and AirPort Express so unstable?  The wireless transmit rate of my MacBook Core 2 Duo is extremely unstable. That is, when I connect to my AirPort Express the transfer rate is good for about one minute and after that it suddenly drops (option click on the AirPort icon shows a transmit rate of 1...).
The strange thing is that when I then click on the AirPort icon next to the clock and new networks are being searched, the rate gets normal again for about 10 seconds. Then again all running downloads and page load stop until I click again.
I use the same network with a MacBook Pro without any problems. I've googled this issue, tried to switch wireless channels, switched back to 802.11g mode (it runs on n and g compatible mode normally) but nothing helped so far.
Any ideas what could cause these transfer rate drops?
Update
Not sure if that's of any use but in the AirPort Utility it says Signal -24, Noise -95 and Rate 1 (it raises when I click the AirPort icon).
Update II
One solution seems to be to switch to 802.11n only 5 GHz (2.4 GHz does not help). The downside: iPhone and many older notebooks don't support it...

A: Something to try is to turn off IPv6 support in your networking preference control panel for wireless, and even for ethernet if you are hardwired.
Mine would drop connections randomly and I'd have to mess around and eventually would pull its power and let it restart to restore sanity. Then, I read somewhere it was a problem with IPv6 support, and turn it off on our Macs. Now it's very stable. 
I stopped using it for my wireless router, and now use it for AirTunes. Very seldom will it lag, and when it does it'll sync up again by itself. I really can't remember the last time it "weirded out" on me, even though some days I'll be playing music through it for most of the day.

A: Just in case you're still experiencing the issue. I've been having that happen with my early 2008 MBP for two years now. I seem to have found two half-solutions, see below. Please see if they work for you.
To recap:


*

*Rate is usually good (54)

*drops after minutes, sometimes hours

*rate is good in most all other networks I happen to be in


So, the first thing I noticed is that when I alt-click the airport icon the rate rises from 1 to a rate somewhat higher, maybe 2 or 4 or 8. It then usually drops again. When I alt-click several times in quick succession, I can get the rate to rise up to 48. But again, only to see it drop again.
My first half-solution is this: I found out that whenever I experience the rate dropping I can change the channel in my router from, say 1 to 6 or 11, which will usually resolve the issue. After I reconnect to the network things will be fine for a while (minutes, hours, sometimes a day or two).
My second half-solution is turning off all other wireless clients in the network. Whenever I'm alone at home and my laptop is the only computer running, everything's fine. I seem to be having the dropping-rate-problem only when other clients are in the same network, especially when one of them is using the network intensely. I'm almost certain about that now. Please try and see if removing all other clients "solves" your issue.
Whenever it is not avoidable to have other clients in the network, I try the first half-solution (sometimes 2 or 3 times) and it usually does the trick.
Incredibly annoying though!

A: Your wireless card in the computer need replacing. I have 2 Mac Books. an old 2008 Core Duo that does exactly what you describe. And a new Mac Air. The Mac Air works all over the house and has a transmission rate upwards of 300 depending on were it is located. Bottom line wireless cards get weak and die a slow death. The are not hard to replace if you are at all good with a screwdriver.The can be found all over the net and on ebay as well as Ifixit.
