Q: Comparing GPU capabilities of Mac models? I'm considering replacing my four year old MacBook Pro non-unibody with an Air, possibly when the line refreshes. My one consideration was GPU output, though. I know my old GeForce 8600M GT isn't much nowadays, but is it better than the onboard 320Ms in the current Air line?
My main question, though: is there a reliable benchmark for graphics output, like Geekbench but for GPU?

A: You could give OpenMark a try.

OpenMark is an OpenGL benchmark for
  Mac OS X. OpenMark tests the raw speed
  of the video card drawing a variable
  (automatic or user-defined) number of
  triangles and generates a screenshot
  and a text report of the results.
