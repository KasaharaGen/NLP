Q: How do I get the American Flag back on my menu bar? I'm new to Macs and got a 2011 MacBook Pro a few weeks ago and when I first set it up there was an American Flag on my menu bar.  Somehow it has disappeared and I can't figure out how to get it back.


A: in the Language and Text, under Input source, you need to select one or more input sources; you also need to select Keyboard and Character Viewer on the top of the input source list.
As far as I know, the flag is displayed only when you select more than one input source; differently, the icon you see is a generic one.
This is the icon you see when just an input source is selected.

This is the icon you see when you selected two or more input sources; in this case, the selected input source is "Italian Pro."


A: You have to go to your system preferences and go to language and religion or language and text. When you get there you will see a small button in the bottom that says keyboard preferences, when you get there you can choose your languages and you will have the small flag.
