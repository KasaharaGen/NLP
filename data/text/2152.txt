Q: How can I force iPhone to resync contacts from server? I sync email, contacts and calendar to my company's Exchange server. This morning all of my contacts are gone from my iPhone (iPhone 4, iOS 4.2.1). Facts that further explain:


*

*My contacts were good last night

*I haven't synched to my computer, updated any apps or changed any settings since then

*I'm getting email and my calendar entries are all good.

*I see all my contacts when I log into the web mail interface to the Exchange server


Is there a way to tell the iPhone to wise up and realize that it has screwed up its contacts?

A: Maybe you've already tried this but I'll suggest it anyway.
Check Groups

*

*Open Contacts

*Tap the arrow in the upper-left corner labelled Groups if it exists.

*Ensure you have selected the right group of contacts.

Try Re-Sync
If you need to re-sync because the above did not work you could try this:

*

*Open the Settings app

*Open Accounts & Passwords (or the Mail section on older iOS).

*Select the account causing problems. (Usually called Exchange.)

*Turn Contacts off and tap ‘Delete From My iPhone’ when prompted.

*Turn Contacts back on and tap ‘Sync’ when prompted.


A: Above trick worked perfectly for my iPhone 5S. Thank you very much. After my new carrier asked me to reset ALL on my phone, I had lost everything, Google contacts, emails, etc.
