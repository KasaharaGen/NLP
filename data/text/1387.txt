Q: I downloaded iTunes 10 but now it won't update my iPod Touch software I downloaded the newest version of iTunes because it said it couldn't update the iPod Touch to 4.2 without it, but after the download I went to update my iPod Touch and iTunes said it couldn't contact the update server. This happened when I downloaded iTunes 9 and tried to update, but I never fixed it. Any help would be appreciated!

A: Is there a error number associated with this error?
Did you check to see if you have an internet connection?
Did you restart your computer?
Did you wait a while and try back later? Apple could be experiencing a downtime when you tried to access their server.
Do you have a firewall on? Is the port open for iTunes?
It could be any number of things...Let me know if this helps!

A: Would be helpful in narrowing down the cause: 


*

*Win or Mac OS X?

*Current version installed? (btw, the latest version is now 4.2.1. A last-minute fix caused the version number to revise)


Things that come to mind off-hand:


*

*iTunes version you downloaded is 10.1? (the latest at this moment)

*Firewall? Antivirus?


Worst case: Use the links from this page, or a page like this, to download the image for the new OS manually and perform a backup-and-restore using the image. WARNING: Not for novices!
