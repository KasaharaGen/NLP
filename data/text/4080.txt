Q: PowerBook G4 PMU Reset Required I have to do a PMU reset to turn on my G4 PowerBook (1.25 GHz).  This occurs on every shutdown of the system.
What are potential causes of this?
I'm perfectly happy to troubleshoot, but on Google I'm hitting a lot of misinformation.
I notice that my battery also has 0 Remaining capacity (From System Profiler), even though it only has 125 cycles on it (i.e. not charging).  Not sure if this is important, but thought I would throw it in there.

More Info:


*

*Did reset-nvram & reset-all from open firmware first

*Sleep: light flashes on front, never wakes back up.  (Have to PMU reset)

*Battery Removed: still have to reset PMU after each shutdown.

*Removed PRAM Battery: still have to reset PMU after each shutdown.


A: Sounds as if your PRAM battery needs replacing... Assuming you have a A-1046 G4 Powerbook which does have a PRAM battery and you are losing the time setting I would try the PRAM battery first. It is a simple job and the cheapest quick check.
