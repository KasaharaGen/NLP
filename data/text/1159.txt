Q: Setting the default browser Is there any way to set the default web browser from within Mac OS? 
I currently run Firefox 4 Beta, and haven't been able to find anywhere within the browser to set it as the default - possibly because it is a Beta. However, this makes Chrome start up as soon as I click a link from somewhere other than within FF, which is a tad annoying.

A: *

*Open Safari

*âŒ˜, to open Preferences

*On the General tab there's a pull down that says 'Default web browser', the the one you want from the list


A: You can also use "Default Apps" for change every default application.
