Q: How to make DVD from iMovie Apple has decided to exclude iDVD from Lion, and I haven't found an easy way to make a DVD that can be played on my DVD player created in iMovie.
I found this question
However, there is no clear answer there.
I dont have iDVD, and I cannot get it, but I still want to be able to create a DVD.
Does anyone know how this can be done?

A: You can export your movie to a format of your wishes (.avi, .dv, ...) and then you can burn this on a disk with a suitable software suite (Roxio Toast or with the built in software of Lion/Mac OS)
EDIT: for free, software, I would recommend you use Burn

A: See if you can find a friend who actually bought the boxed set of iLife before Apple outmoded iDVD. If so, have them copy iDVD.app out of their applications folder and give it to you.

A: DVD-Creator is well reviewed, similar to iDVD and $39.99 on the Mac App Store.

I have no connection with this app or the manufacturer.

A: Correction: iMovie '11 does NOT have a direct option to burn to DVD
You will either have to share via web or download a dvd encoding burning program.
Disk utility is another way to burn dvd's, unfortunately it won't be in a format that is playable on a dvd player.  It would end up burning as a Data DVD
-Hope this helps

A: In iMovie '11 go to the Share menu and select Burn to DVD.
