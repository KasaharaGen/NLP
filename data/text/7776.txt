Q: Battery life not like advertised on new MacBook Pro I bought a MacBook Pro 15.4" in September and the battery life is nothing like what is advertised. I'm struggling to get 4 hours out of it with wifi off and Ethernet as my network connection. The spec I choose wasn't the best, either: it only has the 2.2GHz Core i7 with the better graphics card model, no other additions. 
I bought it because of its great battery life, I've tried turning screen brightness down and the keyboard backlight off and still nothing. I am mainly using it to type up lecture notes in the lecture so I am running it off battery power only using Word and PowerPoint. Should I be concerned and take it back to Apple? I know the Core i7 is power hungary but, still, this is ridiculous as it's less than a month old â€“ I was expecting to be able to use it for a full day without the battery dying.

A: Get a program like gfxCardStatus to monitor which graphics card is in use, and watch out for Flash or other processor-hungry apps in the background. 
Everything @bmike said in his comment is correct, too.

A: I would recommend performing a battery calibration.  For various reasons, Macs tend to lose their ability the gauge the actual amount of battery charge remaining.  Battery calibration re-teaches the system how to measure its battery life, sometimes making a significant difference.  In any case, it's free to do, and is also good to do every now and again.
Your computer may be fairly new, but the battery could be many months old and may not have been stored or traveled in the most ideal of conditions (extreme heat, cold, moisture) on its way from the factory to you, which could have had an effect on its "calibration".  This may or may not make a big difference for you, but it doesn't hurt to try.

For your model, this would involve:


*

*Charging battery to 100%.

*Leaving computer on and awake, disconnect power.

*Keeping the computer on and awake, run down battery until computer shuts itself off.  You can use the computer during this time.**

*After computer has gone to sleep, leave it alone for at least 5 hours (I usually leave it overnight.)

*Reconnected charger, and leave connected until fully charged.
**Caffiene is a great free program for overriding your Mac's power settings, and keeping it awake.
