Q: Can I install OS X Snow Leopard on 2006 mac mini? So..I bought my first macbook pro few days ago, but found I don't need a laptop. I figured out that I can buy used mac mini + windows laptop for my developer environment.
is it possible to install snow leopard on a 2006 mac mini?

A: Yes it is. See here.
As long as it is an Intel Mac Mini (with a minumum of 1gb ram) you'll be fine.
If its a Power PC Mac Mini then you'll only be able to install Leopard (not Snow Leopard)
