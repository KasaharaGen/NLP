Q: Rename iOS device without needing to restore I have just restored my iPad but for some reason (most likely because I pressed space bar on that text field but do you not remember) my newly restored iPad is called "iPad" rather than "my name's iPad". Is there a way to rename your iPad without having to go though the restore process again? 
Note: Jailbreaking is not of the question.
Thanks

A: *

*Connect your device and open iTunes.

*In the source list (the left-hand column of iTunes), double-click on the name of the device.

*Type the new name for your device and press Return on the keyboard.

*Sync the device (press Sync in the bottom right corner of the screen).
