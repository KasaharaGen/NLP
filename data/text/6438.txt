Q: cmd+/ shortcut gone 1Password shortcut cmd+\ stopped working on all browsers so I tried to change it to cmd+/ just to try but now I lost cmd+/!
I tried to reset the keyboard shortcuts to default from the preference page but that didn't help.
How can I get cmd+/ back? (the shortcut to show the main window when no window is showing)
I'm using Lion.

A: When did it stop working, when you upgraded to Lion, or more recently?  Has the shortcut ever worked for you in Lion?
There is a new Safari Extension for 1Password within Safari in Lion that is different to what has come before, ensure it is installed and check the shortcut again.  Mine works fine, you may have an old plugin installed.  I don;t use other browsers, so cannot comment, but would imagine that they too have an all new plugin for Lion.
CMD / should toggle the status bar on/off at the bottom of your browser window in Safari.

A: You need 1Password v3.6.5 or newer to have single keystroke log in to work with Safari 5.1 (Lion or not)
It's on their FAQ - http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/single_keystroke_login.html
