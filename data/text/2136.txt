Q: Can I connect an iPad and an Eye-Fi Card? I have the Eye-Fi Pro X2 Card and an iPad. I just wonder if there is a way to transfer pictures from my camera wirelessly without going through the Internet or a real wireless network - basically I want an ad-hoc connection between the iPad and the card.
I do own the iPad camera connection kit which works, but that kinda defeats the purpose of an Eye-Fi Card in the first place :)

A: Apparently, it's coming soon to Eye-Fi cards, and they will have firmware upgrades for all existing cards..
