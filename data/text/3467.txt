Q: Advice to minimize memory usage in iPod Touch 2G with iOS 4.2.1 Since I updated from iOS 4.0 to iOS 4.2.1 my iPod Touch consumes less memory but still would like to hear some more advices about how to reduce memory leak in my device?
Usually I use Free Memory apps to free up some amount of memory, that is only thing I know. 
Note, my iOS it doesn't have multitasking features.

A: Free Memory apps are a rip off and really dont make your ipod any faster. Try rebooting your device 2 times in a row. And disable any Notifications you have. Disable Bluetooth. And if you aren't using WiFi turn it off.
