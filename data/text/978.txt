Q: How do I use multiple webcams at once on Mac OS X? I have programmed a Flash app that makes use of several webcams at the same time. The app works great on Windows. When I try to use more than one webcam on Mac OS X, I find that each webcam I plug into the computer disables the previously attached webcam.
It appears that I can only have one USB camera working at a time. Is this correct? Is there any way of bypassing this?

A: There are Mac applications that can do this, although I don't believe that any of them run on Flash.
Here's some that I found:


*

*Wirecast from Telestream

*BoinxTV from Boinx Software

*CamCamX from Black-Op


They're all commercial, but there's a wide range of pricing between the three.

A: I had a similar problem where one USB camera would work and the other camera wouldn't.  After playing around with this I found out it was because I was using a USB-C hub and plugging both cameras into the same hub.  Either the hardware or OS supported only one camera per Macbook USB-C port.
I put the cameras through two separate USB-C hubs and they worked fine.
I'm using a newer Macbook and was attempting keep it simple to plug everything through one plug, but if I really want to use the two cameras simultaneously it seems this is impossible.
