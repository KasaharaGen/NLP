Q: What is the keyboard shortcut for editing a cell in Excel? I can't find the keyboard shortcut for this on the mac. It's F2 on a windows machine.

A: Office for Windows: F2 
Office for Mac: Ctrl + U

A: The problem is that the shortcut has been changed for earlier versions of excel.
F2 used to work on Excel versions before 2011.
For the 2011 excel version use ctrl + U instead.

A: I believe F2 still works, its just that on macs now, to get F2, you need to press fn+F2, otherwise it does the alternative function, which in my mac is to brighten the screen.

A: Excel for Mac 2016: F2
The most recent version of Office for Mac (2016) changed a number of keyboard shortcuts to create greater similarity across Windows and Mac versions of the software.  Ctrl + U appears to no longer work as a shortcut key for editing cells in Excel 2016 for Mac. Instead the F2 key must be used. Depending on the keyboard settings on your particular Mac, to trigger F2 (instead of increasing screen brightness), you may have to hold down the "function" key (fn) while also hitting F2. To modify this behavior, go to System Preferences > Keyboard and check or uncheck "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys."
