Q: How to switch window with swiss german keyboard? I got used to switching between open windows in an application on my other mac (US keyboard: command + tilde.
This doesn't really work on swiss german keyboards, since the tilde is generated with: alt + n. Pressing command + alt + n behaves the same as command + n, that is, the applications tend to open new windows instead of cycling existing ones.
Any tips?

A: And you can edit this in your general settings > keyboard > shortcut to suit your needs.

A: Never mind, I just figured it out by myself:
It turns out, on swiss german keyboards, the shortcut for cycling through windows is not command + tilde but instead command + backtick. The backtick is on the same key as caret, which is the first key to the left of the backspace key. Therefore, I need to press:
command + shift + ^
