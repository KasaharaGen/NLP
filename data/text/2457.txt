Q: Graphical Ping Plotter, similar to Perfgraph? On Windows, I use a program called Perfgraph, which, among other things, showed a visual graph of ping latency to various hosts in my Task bar. Here's an example:

The ping metric is the graph on the far right.
Does anyone know if something like this is available for OS X? I use it to ping my router and my DNS name server so that I always have a graphical indicator on my connection quality, and if there are problems I know if the source is inside or outside my router.
So far, the only "alternative" is the CLI ping command, which just doesn't present the information in as easily digestible format as Perfgraph.
I don't need all the other functions of Perfgraph, I just want that ping plotter!
Thanks all!

A: I have a nice CLI solution - it's called mtr. It's installable via homebrew or ports.
Here is a screenshot:


A: Nagios does install with ports on MacOS X.
Have a look at these performance graphs.

I must quote here the final message of Nagions installer:

But Nagios is a complex program so you should read the documentation online at
  http://www.nagios.org or locally at /opt/share/nagios/docs/index.html to fully understand Nagios.


A: Some time ago I wrote small app called Lagometer which shows ping to selected host (you can set it in preferences) as a graph in menubar. It works only with one host, but should work for you.
