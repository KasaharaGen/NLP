Q: How do I duplicate an audio CD on Lion without importing tracks into iTunes? I want to create an exact duplicate of an audio CD on my Mac (Lion). Is there a way that does not involve to import the CD into iTunes? I just don't want to remember that I have to delete the tracks after copying. And I'm not sure if importing and burning again really creates an exact copy. (Track gaps preserved, and so on)
I tried using Finder, Crtl-click the CD, select duplicate. Ctrl-click the resulting Folder and select burn to CD, but that left my with a data CD containing AIFF-Files.
Any ideas, or AppStore suggestions?

A: Toast ($99)
Lets you capture, copy, convert, share and burn discs
or 
Burn (open source)
again does the same but a more basic version which is free.

A: You can use the Disk Utility (included in OS X, Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility) to create an image of a music CD. You can then eject the source disk and with the same Disk Utility you can burn the disk image to a blank CD-R.
