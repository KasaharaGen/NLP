Q: Tcl/tk for Mac OS X 10.6, not possible to download? I've upgraded git today and in its README file I found the following excerpt:

If you don't already have Tcl/Tk Aqua
  installed on your computer (most MacOS
  X installs have it), you will get this
  error message. To resolve it, simply
  go to the website for Tcl / Tk Aqua
  and download the latest version:
http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/
If you have an older version of Tcl /
  Tk Aqua, you'll benefit from
  upgrading. There have been many
  usability improvements since the
  version that comes shipped with MacOS
  X Leopard.

I tried the link and it redirects to Daniel A. Steffen LinkedIn page, who is the lead developer of Tcl/Tk for Mac, as far as I understand. I tried googling to find alternative links, but they all redirect to the same LinkedIn page. From this I gather that either this alternative version is already included in the Mac OS X, or there is some ongoing conflict. Can anybody enlighten the situation?

A: Tcl/Tk Aqua is available from this page
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcltkaqua/
This page has the latest version.

A: As an alternative, Tcl (beta) is now available as from ActiveState
