Q: Prevent mobile Safari from loading the last page when started Whenever I open Safari on both my iPhone and iPad, it starts loading the last webpage that I visited in the past, which is not very convenient. 
Is there a way to stop it from doing this?

A: You could save a bookmark to about:blank (or your desired home page) as an icon in your home screen. Then click that to launch Safari rather than the Safari icon.
To do this:


*

*open Safari.

*Type the url about:blank into the URL area and go to that page. The page will, unsurprisingly, be empty.

*Press the share button, and select "Add to Home Screen"

*Assign a name to this blank page. In your case, you might want to call it Safari.


(Dan Frakes of MacWorld spells out these steps at http://www.macworld.com/article/159303/2011/04/ios_safari_blank_page.html; thanks to Heng-Cheong Leong for point this out).
Alternately, you could close any pages you had open in Safari before exiting the program.
