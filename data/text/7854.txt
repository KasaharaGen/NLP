Q: What causes Firefox to not show me a new tab? Can this be fixed? I am using Firefox 7.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7. Often times when I make a new window, the tab bar contains only a single "+" tab, even after I got to a URL:

If I make new tabs, then I cannot get back to the first tab I created. This is extremely annoying. Is there a fix for this?
