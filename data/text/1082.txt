Q: How do I use Mac's Preview application text speech feature? How could I let Preview start speaking a selected paragraph? I found the speech menu item in the edit menu but this starts speaking from the beginning of the document!

A: There is a convenient way of making your Mac speak any selected text.


*

*Open System Preferences.

*Select Speech.

*Select the Text to Speech tab if it is not already selected.

*Check the box for Speak selected text when the key is pressed and provide a key combination of your choice.


You can now use the key combination to speak selected text system-wide.

A: I read the above comment and tried to follow the instructions I was unsuccessful (as I didn't highlight the text).  Although, having now solved the issue you need to highlight the selected text and then press the key combination (mine is ctrl+s).
Now I use it on all applications including preview, Microsoft Word, chrome etc.  I love it.
