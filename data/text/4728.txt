Q: Is there a way to pickup iPhone calls on my Macbook Pro? I have my iPhone headset plugged into my Macbook Pro so that I can listen to some proper music and have my Iphone 4 lying next to my MB Pro.
Now, of course, it would be really really fancy if there was a way I could proxy my incoming iPhone calls to my MB Pro via Bluetooth (essentially turning my MB Pro into a bluetooth headset) so that I can still pick up calls with my iPhone headset, even though it is plugged into my MB Pro.
Is there a way to do this?

A: This is a feature apple brought with the lastest OS X : OS X Yosemite. 
OS X Yosemite is still a beta and will be released publicly in fall 2014. 

A: As of June 2011, BluePhoneElite was providing this feature, supporting a great range of mobile phones, but it became abandonware! :(
Their website is suggesting Phone Amego as an alternative. It may worth to check it out.
