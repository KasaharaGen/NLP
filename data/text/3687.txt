Q: How can I config my Mac to don't scape characters when I copy and paste some text on the console? Is there anyway to config my Mac to don't scape characters when I copy and paste some text on the console? Could anybody help me? It is driving me crazy to erase all \ characters inserted after a simple copy and paste on the console.
Many thanks,
Thiago

A: If you are asking about pasting into windows of the Terminal application (which is not the same as Console application; neither of which are the same as the actual “console”), then you can uncheck the Escape non-ASCII input option in the “settings set” that you are using.
With Terminal active, open the preferences: Press ⌘ + , or select the Terminal > Preferences… menu item.

*Click the Settings icon in the tool bar of the preferences window.

*From the list on the left side of the preferences window,
select the “settings set” that you want to modify.
The settings set of the previously active Terminal window will be initially selected.

*Click the Advanced tab.

*Uncheck the Escape non-ASCII input checkbox.
