Q: Where is the sender name for iMessages set? I need to change it on an iPhone 4 (iOS 5) The sender id as it displays on the recipients iMessage is what I would like to reset. However, I cannot find where it is set on the sending device (iPhone 4). It seems to be device dependent as sending iMessages from my iPad 2 displays a different sender name although both devices use the same Appleid.

A: I hope I understood your question correctly. Try this: go to settings>>messages>>caller id. Choose the email address that is associated with the name you want the recipients to see

A: I'm pretty sure that it's set in the contact for that person's AppleID/Email Address. Take a look in that persons info in Contacts.app.
