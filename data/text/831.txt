Q: Is there any way to have an iPad auto update its date and time? On my iPhone, my date and time are set automatically. Is there any way to do the same thing on the iPad to ensure it always displays the correct time?

A: It should update automatically by default (Settings → General → Date & Time).
Are you running the latest iPad OS (3.2.2)? I have a vague recollection of a bug in the iPad that caused the time to go out of sync that might have been fixed in a software update. I can't seem to find any info about it, but you might want to update the software just in case.

A: It seems that the setting is only available on the 3G model.
It does not exist on the latest version of iOS (4.2.1) on the Wi-Fi model.

A: The Settings -> General -> Date & Time panel looks like this on a Wi-Fi iPad running iOS 4.2.1: 

Old-school… with a new-school interface.
