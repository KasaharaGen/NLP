Q: Is there a Quick Look plug-in for ZIP files? Is there a Quick Look plug-in that works with ZIP files, and that lists all the files contained in the archive? It is also fine if it lists at least some of the files.

A: There's also the open source qlZipInfo that works for .zip, .jar, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z, .xar, .pkg, .deb, .rpm, .7z, .xz, .cab, .gz, .lha, .hqx, .sit, .iso, .cdr, and .toast files.
Install instructions are given on its GitHub page; it supports macOS from 10.6 to the current release (12.6). It provides a simple list of files and directories (if present) with totals.

A: Well, Better Zip  does a fair job.

A: WinZip installs one but BetterZip's is better, although includes an advert for BetterZip each time you use it. 

A: Another alternative is The Archive Browser.  It is a commercial tool as well but will show the contents of various file types.
From the site:

The Archive Browser lets you easily peek into the archive, find the files you need, preview and extract them without unarchiving everything. Quick Look any file or folder and open them right from the archive
