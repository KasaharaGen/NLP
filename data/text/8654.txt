Q: How do you edit the favorites list on Lion finder? Dragging in and out doesn't seem to be working for me, but I can see the ones I dragged in there before I upgraded:


A: You should still be able to drag items on to the sidebar. To remove them either right/command(⌘)-click and select Remove from Sidebar or drag while holding ⌘.

A: I don't think you can drag folders out anymore (to prevent accidental deletions), but if you right click you should have a "remove from sidebar" item in the context menu.

A: Command/drag works for me - as does the right click.
