Q: How do I enter DFU mode on an iPhone 3G OS 4.2.1? I've tried several solutions to enter DFU mode but none worked:
- the Home + Sleep combo
- the DFU program here
Somebody has an idea?

A: DFU has always worked as follows:


*

*Turn off the phone

*Hold power and Home for 10 seconds (exactly 10 seconds, use a clock with seconds)

*Release Power, but keep holding Home

*After 5-10 seconds you should get the phone detected on the computer with the screen still black.


I've tested this on 2G, 3G, 3Gs and works on all of them fine.
Here's a video on how to do DFU properly: iPhone DFU Mode
Also I just like to note that this procedure must not be mistaken for recovery mode (iTunes cable screen), which is done by:


*

*Hold Home

*Keep holding Home, press power to start the device (1-2 sec is enough)

*Release power, keep holding Home until you get to the iTunes cable screen


A: This is not DFU, this is recovery mode.
DFU is:
- 2 sec Power
- 10 sec Power + Home
- 15 sec Home
And it doesn't work for me.
