Q: Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram? Is there any software for mac to create this particular 3d histogram: 

given a matrix of value?
I've tried with Numbers but it doesn't have 3d histograms.

A: Mathematica is able to do this.

A: You can do things like that in MatLab or the free clone Octave. There's a script here. 

A: Grapher is probably the app you are looking for. It is already installed on your Mac by default.

A: Gnuplot mught be ablo to do this. I've seen pictures where something like this is done:


A: Microsoft Excel works for this sort of graph as well.

A: R Studio (the wonderful IDE for R) can do this. It's the kind of the thing it was meant to do really. Free, open source and, IMO, easier to grasp than Octave (and free, wherease Matlab is most definitely not). You'll likely want the RGL addon to do a 3D plot.
There's a StackOverflow question that deals with how you go about plotting the 3D histogram in R.

A: LibreOffice (~ OpenOffice ~ NeoOffice) to give some free office applications.
