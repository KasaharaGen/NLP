Q: Is a partial restore from an Address Book .abbu file possible? I have an old Address Book .abbu archive that has some contact data that I need to recover. I do not want to restore the entire address book archive, and I especially do not want to overwrite my current address book.
But...  It seems like the only way to access an .abbu file is to entirely replace the current address book in a full restore.
Is there any way to browse and selectively access contacts in an address book archive?
Thanks!

A: You can


*

*store the contents of your current Address Book in an archive (.abbu)

*restore the contents of the old file. 

*purge the entries you don't want to keep

*export the remaining ones

*the current archive file (created in step 1)

*import the file from step 4
