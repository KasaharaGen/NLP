Q: "Erase and Install" function missing in Snow Leopard When installing Tiger or Leopard, there was an option called "Erase and Install" that would delete the disk before installing the new OS.
In Snow Leopard, this option seems to be missing. Is there any way I can add "Erase and Install" back to Snow Leopard?

A: With Snow Leopard Erase and Install is now a two step process:


*

*When you start up off the Mac OS X Install DVD from the Tools menu choose "Disk Utility". You will then want to erase the hard drive you want to install on.

*Install Mac OS X as you would normally. 


A: Use the tools menu --> disk utility to erase the partition you want to install Snow Leopard on.  Then proceed with the installation.

A: Because Snow Leopard is an technically a Leopard upgrade it might not be readily accessible.
You can boot up and under the "Tools" menu open up Disk Utility to erase before you install.
