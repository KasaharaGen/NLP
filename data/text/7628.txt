Q: Diagram Software I study computing on an advanced level and I need a program that will make it easier to create flowcharts and other diagrams efficiently. I don't need too many features; I just want something that works! I'm aware that there are many website that do exactly what I need but most of the times when I need to draw diagrams I don't have access to the internet

A: It isn't cheap, but OmniGraffle from OmniGroup is truly outstanding. Student pricing is available, and substantially less expensive than full retail price. ($60 vs $100)

A: Two that I know of:


*

*Shapes - Cheap ($5) with a decent array of tools

*OmniGraffle - Expensive, but it can do pretty much anything, including reading Vizio files (Pro version)


A: Try Graphviz(http://www.graphviz.org/).  It is free, powerful, and easy to learn.  You don't need draw anything, just write a piece of code, and the program will generate a fig for you.  

A: The OpenOffice.org office suite (and its forked cousin, LibreOffice) is completely free, and includes a drawing application that is actually fairly useable for creating diagrams and flowcharts at the simpler end of the scale.
