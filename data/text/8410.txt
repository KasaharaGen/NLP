Q: Any way to edit and/or add autocorrect entries? Perhaps a silly question: But let's say I have a word that I love to misspell. Okay, maybe not exactly. But maybe Lion has a problem with ReiserFS and keeps:


*

*Suggesting something else (autocorrect).

*Marks it as incorrect. 


Is there anyway to:


*

*Stop Lion from suggesting something else for ReiserFS. (I still want to keep autocorrect on!)

*Add this word to the dictionary so that it's no longer marked as misspelled. 


Cheers!

A: Sure. Learn spelling.​​​​​​​​​
