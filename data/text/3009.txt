Q: MacBook white support 64-bit Need to ask a question about my MacBook White
It's Early 2009 model (http://support.apple.com/kb/SP504)
My question is, will it support:
1. Snow Leopard with 64-bit
2. Windows 7 with 64-bit
Thanks

A: With Snow Leopard, you never really say if you want 64bit or not.
With Windows, yes, according to this Apple KB, your laptop supports 64bit Windows

A: This model has a 64-bit CPU, and thus can run programs in 64-bit mode in both Leopard and Snow Leopard (note that MacOS doesn't have an overall 32/64-bit switch, it just runs each program in the best mode available).  It will not support booting Snow Leopard's kernel in 64-bit mode (see Apple's KB article #HT3770), but the kernel mode is not particularly important.
