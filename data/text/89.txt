Q: How to automount a network share once OpenVPN has connected? (Using Tunnelblick) Does anyone know how to automatically mount a network share once a VPN connection using Tunnelblick has connected?
Right now I have to connect and then do a cmd+K in the finder to connect to the AFP share. It'd be nice if it would connect automatically.
The share doesn't have a password (TimeCapsule without any passwords, and no, not using it for backup, we use it for a fileserver).

A: 1.
Edit the file /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.up.osx.sh and add these commands at the end of the file, just before exit 0 :
su USERNAME -c '
mkdir /Volumes/TimeCapsule
mount_afp afp://afp_username@server/volumename /Volumes/TimeCapsule
'
open /Volumes/TimeCapsule

Replace USERNAME with your username on the system.
2.
Then add the following at the end of /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.down.osx.sh :
umount /Volumes/TimeCapsule

3.
Do not forget to check the set nameserver option for your configuration : 

Warning : Configuration files client.(up|down).osx.sh are executed for every connections made using OpenVPN.
This could also be made using launchd for watching if the vpn connection is up, but I don't know how to use launchd.

A: I have just succeeded to auto-mount NFS after having connected VPN and auto-unmount before discconect with Tunnelblick (3.7.3 on macOS High Sierra).
At first, I had the same problem with Cameron Conner. Still, Studer's answer was quite helpful for me.
Instead of Studer's client.(up|down).osx.sh, I placed two lines in the .ovpn:
up (path to your connected.sh)
down (path to your pre-disconnect.sh)

Then create and edit these connected.sh and pre-disconnect.sh.
connected.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo mkdir /Volumes/NFS
sudo mount -P 192.168.0.1:/share /Volumes/NFS

pre-disconnect.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo umount /Volumes/NFS

I don't know about TimeCapsule manipulation. So above process is about NFS. I think you can arrange it for TimeCapsule.
I think the point Cameron and I got stucked was su or sudo. And, to avoid password is another problem. My solution to that was sudoers.
Edit /etc/sudores with visudo. Modify the %admin entry from:
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

to:
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Unless your account is not an admin, it should work.
