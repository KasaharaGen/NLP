Q: How to delay locking of my Mac when I am not using it Right now, it gets locked in 3-4 minutes. How do I delay the locking?
I am using snow leopard

A: In Lion, there's a setting in System Preferences under Security & Privacy asking how long after sleep or the screen saver begins is the password required.


A: Step 1 select system preferences

Step 2 select baterry

Step 3 adjust the scroller "turn off display after"


A: In macOS Sierra, 
Click on apple icon Left top corner -> System Preferences..
Click on Security & Privacy Icon
Click on General tab.
Now you can increase or decrease locking time.



A: This is get from support.apple.com, 
Turn off your display or put it to sleep
Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, then click Energy Saver.
Use the slider to choose the time of inactivity. If you set your display to turn off before the screen saver starts, the screen saver won't start after a period of inactivity.

A: If anyone gets this problem you wont solve it with the above. You will need to go to system preferences and then energy saving and then set the time-out for battery and plug-in use. Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and enter Energy Saving. Once you're in you'll find it :)

A: Use this helpful app for easy toggling between locking or not: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12
