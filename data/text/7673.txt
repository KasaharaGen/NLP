Q: iTunes store / Books / Column browser If I go to the Books section of the iTunes store, I see the Column browser:

If i try to go back to the standard view (my Command+B or using the menu "View" -> "Column Browser" -> "Hide Column Browser" I am redirected to the main store page. If I click back on books in the top bar, I get the books section again in Column browser mode.
How can I get rid of it?
If I do not choose the "Books" section, but instead I click on the small down-arrow near "Books" and choose a section. I get the usual view with the covers and so on.

A: I do not experience the problem anymore. I am now getting a normal/usual view. Since I didn't notice when it was fixed it is difficult to say if it was a bug or an issue with the Swiss iTunes store.
