Q: WiFi problem after 4.3.2 jailbreak I've just jailbroken my iPhone (3Gs, 5.13.04, iOS 4.3.2, Pwnage Tool 4.3.2). 
Now I'm experiencing troubles with WiFi, so I can't do an unlock. I have an AirPort Express router, it works well with other devices, the iPhone does have connection with the router (in the Settings -> Wifi menu there is a checkmark in front of my network) but there is no indication of WiFi connection and none of my applications see this connection.
How can I solve this problem?
Thanks in advance.

A: I've found a solution, it is not pretty clear, but it works. 
First, I've rebooted my router
Second, in Settings -> General -> Network I've set Cellular Data and Enable 3G to OFF. After that operation WiFi indicator appeared and everything went well. 
Hope it helps to those who experience the same problem.
