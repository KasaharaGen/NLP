Q: Is there a good free DWG viewer for Mac OS X? There are new Autodesk products (AutoCAD LT or similar) for Mac OS and iOS, but I couldn't find a simple free DWG viewer for Mac.

A: AutoCAD WS is a free app on the Mac App Store. I've never tried it.

A: A360 Viewer
AutoCAD's A360 Viewer is a browser based tool for viewing DWG files:

A360 Viewer Free online viewer - View designs in more than 50 file formats, including .dwg, right in your browserâ€”no downloads or plug-ins needed.

Edit: 2021-11-26: A360 viewer requires Autodesk subscription to be able to upload and view .dwg files.
LibreCAD
LibreCAD is open source, free, and can read and write DWG files.


A: The free eDrawings Viewer for Mac claims to be able to read and display DWG files. The Microspot DWG Viewer also provides support for DWG files.
I don't have any DWG files to test these two products on at the moment, but they're worth a shot.

A: I did try the eDrawings Viewer for Mac but it doesn't allow do measurements and printing is not great neither.
I finally found viewer which has all what I was looking for - ZWCAD Viewer. Get it from "cnet.com" as I couldn't find it on the ZWSOFT home page.

A: I've found "Fast Cad Reader" on Mac App Store. It is incredibly fast and easy to use. It is only for simple DWG file reading, does not have pro features but I think it is far by the best -just view- app available for mac.
