Q: muting start-up sound on Lion How can I permanently mute the start-up sound on Lion?
StartupSound.prefPane isn't compatible with Lion. I found Psst, and I guess it's the best option, but it still looks like a hack. Any better ideas?

A: Before I start up my MacBook in the library, I plug in a headset or earbuds (from my phone or iPod).  Hardware mute.  Works with either OS.

A: Maybe not the answer you are looking for, but:
I keep the volume of my MacBook to zero (so no sound on startup) since I do not want sound without earphones or my stereo connected anyway - Mac OS saves different volume settings for “something plugged in” and “nothing plugged in”.
At least, works for me.
