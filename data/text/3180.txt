Q: AppTamer for RAM Does anyone know of an app like AppTamer http://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html that frees RAM usage and not just CPU?

A: Hate to say this, but RAM isn't something that can just magically be erased without an impact on the system. There are four kinds of ram:
Free - is free to use and optimal for use when applications are opened
Inactive - is memory that is no longer used that is deleted when needed. Inactive memory allows for past tasks to occur faster when being repeated (for example launching an application that was previously used but then quit). This RAM basically acts as FREE RAM and the system deletes it and uses it when needed, but deleting it without needing to will actually hinder ur macs performance since these caches will be deleted.
Active & Wired - is used by currently running applications and in NO CASE can it be deleted without a system impact.
What i'm getting at, is that there is no reason to have to clear ram, that which can be cleared is cleared automatically when needed and that which can't be cleared just... can't be cleared :P

A: There's an app in the Mac App Store called iCleanMemory which claims to do this.
Alternatively you can fire up terminal and type "purge" although this may only be available if you have the developer tools installed.
