Q: MobileMe bookmark sync with Opera I am forced to use Opera instead of Safari on windows, and would like to sync my bookmarks with MobileMe. Is this at all possible?

A: Not with MobileMe's built in sync function, it only works with Safari.
You could use Opera's Link, which might work ok for what you're after -

Can I use other browsers to access my bookmarks?
Yes, you can log into a web-based user interface using Opera browsers, including Opera for Mac/PC, Opera Mobile or Opera Mini. You can also access your bookmarks using other Web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari. (Opera faq)


A: Like dropbox, you could simlink the Opera bookmark file into your iDisk. Something like ln -s /Users/.../bookmark.dat /Volumes/iDisk/bookmark.dat
If you want cross-browser bookmark sync - wait for xmarks or similar to come to both of those browsers, so far ti's probably only firefox and chrome.
