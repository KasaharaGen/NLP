Q: Keeping the menu dropdown open after clicking? Suppose I wanted to open a couple of bookmarks in my browser. To do this, I use the menu bar. I click on «Bookmarks» to reveal the dropdown with all my bookmarks and then select the bookmark. The dropdown closes and the browser opens the bookmark. Now I have to click on «Bookmarks» again and click on another bookmark, the dropdown again closes and the browser opens the bookmark. Is there a way to keep the menu dropdown opened after I clicked on an item? That way I could click multiple items in the dropdown way faster! I remember being able to do this in Windows XP some years ago and it was really handy. I think I had to hold down ALT when clicking on the menu item.
Thanks for any advice!
Edit for clarification: I'm only using the bookmark menu as an easy to understand example. I'm looking for a way to do this system-wide!

A: control F2 key gets menu bar focus in full screen app mode
set F Keys to standard function keys via keyboard prefs
keyboard shortcuts "Focus to Menu Bar" 
default is Control F2 for menu bar focus
control F2 for dock focus

A: May depend on the browser but at least in Safari, Firefox and Chrome, Cmd-clicking on a bookmark folder opens a new tab for every bookmark in the folder. May require some bookmark reorganization though.

A: What I would do is go to the Bookmarks Menu (Bookmarks --> Show all Bookmarks) and then select Bookmarks Menu from the collections tree to drag and drop links on a new tab

A: I am aware that this is not a direct answer, but it might help with the problem anyway. This could be an XY problem.
If you find yourself using the same menu items repeatedly, use their keyboard shortcuts. If they don't have shortcuts by default, assign your own in System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Applications.
