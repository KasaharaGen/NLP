Q: Wrong icon for Application folder For some reason, my Applications folder is using the Address book icon in the Dock.  How do I change this back to the correct icon. 
I am using Mac 10.7.2 (although the problem has been there since 10.6). 


A: The icon is not "wrong" : You just have to select "Folder" in the "Display as" menu, not the "Stack". Do this by right-clicking on the folder and select stack.

PS : Just right click on the icon in your dock to make this menu popup.
