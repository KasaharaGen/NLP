Q: Can I change the URL for RSS feed in NetNewsWire? Is it possible to change the URL of a RSS feed in NetNewsWire? And if so, how?
I am using NetNewsWire ver. 3.2.15

A: The feed URL can only be edited if Google Reader sync is off.
Select the feed in the left column and press âŒ˜I to bring up the feed info window.  Click on the triangle next to the URLs entry and you will get a text box that will allow you to edit the feed URL.  There are a bunch of other setting there that allow you to do things like specify how often a particular feed is updated, how long articles are kept, etc.
