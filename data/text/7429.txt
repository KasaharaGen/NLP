Q: Text Editing Newbie Question I have just started playing around with text editing using Text Wrangler. I have real estate sales data cut and pasted from a web site on which I have searched and deleted unwanted data and cleaned up the tabs and spaces nicely. However each data record is still split over 2 lines. One line starts with a letter (persons name) and the next starts with an address (a digit). This pattern repeats all the way down the document. How do I say "if line break is followed on next line with a starting digit, replace line break with a tab"
I assume that would put each record on one line ?

A: I'm assuming you want it like:
Visitor82   123 E. Text Street ...

To do this in Text Wrangler:

*

*Search > Find


*Tick the 'Grep' option


*In the Find Box type:
(?(?!\r\d)then)\r


*In the Replace Box type (or whatever delimiter you would like):
\x20
~ Enjoy!
