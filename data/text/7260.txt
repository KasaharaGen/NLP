Q: Is there a native way to keep a window always on top in Snow Leopard? How can you keep one window always on top? I saw that there are several third party solutions, but is there absolutely no way to do it natively?

A: There is no "native" way to do this. Your existing solution, Afloat, is the only one I've ever heard of (and works quite well).
