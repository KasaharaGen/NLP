Q: How do I get Messages to appear in the Notification Center? I've configured Notifications to display Messages in the Notification Center, but no messages ever appear there.

Is there another setting that I'm missing? Are only certain kinds of messages displayed in the Notification Center?

A: This appears to have been a (temporary) bug that sometimes happened shortly after an app is first configured for Notification Center. The settings indicated in the original question should be sufficient to get messages to appear in Notification Center.

A: Yes, actually there are two things to check:


*

*First "View in Lock Screen" must be ON

*And Messages must be under "In Notification Center"



If you do these, your messages will be displayed in both Notification Center and the Lock Screen.
