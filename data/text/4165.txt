Q: How do I display long list of client on a page using keynote In keynote each page has a fixed size. Just to impress people I am developing a page which will list around 40 clients.
I want the list of client names to appear one after another and the list will scroll down.  Sort of like the reverse of a credits scroll at the end of a movie. How do I do that with Keynote?
For simplicity you can also imagine as having a single page that lists from 1 to 100 vertically.

A: I hope I unterstood what you want...
I tried to create an example: scroll_example.zip
Follow these steps:


*

*Create all your client names

*Group them all to one object (if they're all in one textbox, skip this step)

*Create an action for that object -> Move

*Set the action from bottom to top and specify the duration

*Place your object outside your slide and end position of the move action is of course in your slide (see the example) 


A: If you wanted to do side to side you could add each item as a separate text item, and then apply a Drift build-in animation. Unfortunately Drift only does left to right, or right to left. But it provides a nice organic move in and move out with acceleration and deceleration.
