Q: Transfer from iPad 1 to iPad 2 I understand that backing up in iTunes then restoring the backup to the new device should transfer everything.
But thinking specifically about the case of upgrading my iPad 1 to an iPad 2: Are there any issues I should be aware of if backing up from an original iPad 1 and then restoring to an iPad 2?

A: It'll eat all your apps souls? Aside from that you should be fine, the process works pretty well.
