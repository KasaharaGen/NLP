Q: Why my application icons wiggle when I press ALT key in Launchpad? I tried Launchpad first time today and went through the common modifier keys & their combinations to see if some hidden options appear.
When I pressed ‚å• ALT all the apps started wiggling. What does it mean?

A: Wiggle is the edit mode. (so you can delete or uninstall the apps that came from the app store) 
Holding alt is the quickest way to enter edit mode.

A: If you click and hold them they also start wiggling. It lets you drag them around, to re-arrange them, and also delete apps from the Mac App Store.

A: When they are wiggling you can rearrange them AND delete/remove apps that you yourself have downloaded. System apps (like iOS) cannot be deleted.
