Q: MacBook Pro freezes and shows console error messages When I log in to my MacBook Pro (Mac OS X 10.5.8 w/ Intel 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, and 4 GB of DDR3 ram with a few bad sectors), it started entering my desktop but returned me to the log in screen.
So, I took my MacBook Pro to the nearest Apple Store (where they were holding the memorial for Steve Jobs and I had to wait for hours) :'(, where they determined that one of my launch preferences was corrupted. They created a new account, and they transferred data from my old account to the new one without the bad preferences.
After I got back, my computer continued to work and Spotlight started its indexing again. However, the MacBook Pro started to spontaneously panic (but not a kernel panic) and shows console error messages over the desktop (which freezes). This happens out of the blue without provocation. Here is a screen shot from my iPhone:

Does anyone knows how to fix this??? The problem is I need to do some critical tasks on this computer for the next 7 days, and won't have access to any reinstallation media before then. So I hope I can apply at least a temporary fix for now...
Thanks!
