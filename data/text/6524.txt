Q: Application appearing on all spaces in Lion I had a couple of applications set up to be on all spaces when I was running on Snow Leopard, but now that I'm on Lion I want to turn that off.
I can't work out how to do it. Does anyone know how? There doesn't seem to be an option in System Preferences for it. Perhaps there's a plist or something similar I can edit?

A: In the dock you can right click the application, go to Options and de-select the option there.


A: When the app is running, you can hold your mouse pressed over the dock icon and change desktop binding to none or a specific space. A secondary click works too.
