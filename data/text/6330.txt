Q: Why does my FCE export to DV take forever? I am exporting a sequence from FCE 3.5 with these settings:
Export Using QT Conversion…
Quicktime Movie>Options
    Deselected "Prepare for Internet Streaming"
    Video
        Size>Dimensions>"HD 1920x1080 16:9"
        Settings>Compression>Quality>Best
The export progress window pops up and tells me that it will take 9 minutes. Over the course of the next 2-3 hours, it bumps up to 4 hours or so. After letting it sit overnight, the progress window reads 2 days. I have tried this twice and I still get between 44-48 hours in the morning after it has sat overnight. Any suggestions why this would be taking so long?
Computer Specs:
13" MBP running 10.6.8
2.3 GHz Intel Core i5
4 GB DDR3 RAM
EDIT: I am not exporting it to a DV Stream. I accidentally put it as exporting to a DV Stream, but I was actually exporting it to a QT movie.

A: I figured out why it was taking so long. The reason was because I store all my video on an external USB drive. When I exported it, I exported it to that external USB drive. To fix the problem, I exported from the external USB drive to the internal drive.
Update: I also found out that I need to render all my video first, then export it. This dropped the export time from days down to 20-45 minutes. One of my other problems was that I needed to make sure my footage was in the Apple Intermediate Codec format. Then, FCE doesn't have to bend over backwards to accommodate an "unsupported" format.
