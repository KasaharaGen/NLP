Q: Force a link to open in Safari instead of the in-app browser I have an issue with QR Readers. I encode a URL within a QR Code. When read by many iPhone App they will open the URL within a WebView within the app.
I want to open a vCard there, which those internal things just won't do - page stays blank but when opened directly in Safari everything works great.
Here is my example:


*

*If you visit vcard.nikb.de in Safari it will bring up a VCard

*If you scan the QR below (which opens the site mentioned) it won't open...

So my question is: Is there any way to get out of the WebView and open Safari?

A: This is not possible, unless the app was designed to explicitly support opening Safari (with a button for instance).  You can't modify an app's internal messaging to its own webviews on stock OS iOS devices, for app security reasons if nothing else.  

A: *

*Try www.qrstuff.com

*Choose "contact details (vcard)" in the left column. Put in your data and try that QR-code. Shouldn't need to open Safari for that.
Note: Don't miss the last option, after all the inputs, to link to a vcf-file or input the vcf-data into the qr code as-is. The second option works fine for me.
I hope this solves your problem.
