Q: Transferring data from old macbook to new macbook Is there an easy way to transfer my applications and data from my old macbook pro to my new macbook pro?  I vaguely recall a service or utility that transferred "everything" from an old macbook to a new macbook.

A: You probably mean the Migration Assistant.

A: I would use a Firewire 800 cable.  Start the old one up in target disk mode (hold T while it boots,) and it mounts as an external drive on the new one.  Drag over stuff that's in your /Applications, etc.

A: You can use Time Machine. Although I prefer having a fresh install. One thing I've found great is Dropbox. If all your files are also stored here, you can automatically download them once your OS is ready by installing it (Dropbox).
