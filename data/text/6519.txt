Q: What WiFi authentication protocols does OS X support? I'm trying to find out how many types of WiFi authentications does OS X support. I know it's supports the basic WEP/WPA and even EAP-PEAP. Does anybody have the full list of supported WiFi authentication protocols?
Thanks!

A: From the Support article Accessing 802.1X networks in OS X Lion:

This process can be used to join networks with the following EAPOL
  authentication types:
  
  
*
  
*PEAP
  
*TTLS (see note 1)
  
*LEAP
  
*EAP-FAST (see note 2)
