Q: Tor Browser Bundle Firefox error I just installed the Tor Browser Bundle (1.0.24).  Vidalia launches with no problems.  Tor connections are created.  However, Firefox doesn't start.  When I manually click on the Firefox app in the Vidalia bundle, I get the following error:
You can't open the application Firefox.app because it may be damaged or incomplete.

Is this a Lion-specific error, or is it something I'm overlooking.  Thanks for your help!

A: In Snow Leopard, if I just close it all and start it again it works fine the second time.  Alway fails on the first invocation.  I haven't debugged it further.
