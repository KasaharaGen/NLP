Q: Where can I find alternative alert sounds for my iPhone 4S? There is a very limited set of Alert sounds in Sounds > New Mail > Alert Tones.
Is there a way to add other sounds to this list? I would like something sort and subtle, not something that goes on for 2-3 seconds.

A: Your options are:


*

*Purchase tones using iTunes (on Windows and Mac OS X)

*Compose your own tone using Garagaband (Mac only) and export to iTunes (on
Windows and Mac OS X) for syncing with your iPhone. 

*Create your own tone using Ringer (Mac only) available from Mac AppStore.
