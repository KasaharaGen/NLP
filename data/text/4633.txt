Q: Examples of apps in the Mac App Store not made with objective-c/c/c++? Are there any apps in the store made using mono, ruby or lisp or put together in another alternative way. 
Do you know of any?
The reason I'm asking is because I'm already making apps using cocoa/objective-c, and I really love ruby and obscure languages.

A: It looks like Briquette is written in MacRuby and made it into the MAS, so it looks like there is at least one alternative to Objective-C for MAS apps.

A: I'm fairly certain that Crush the Castle used some sort of Flash-to-ObjC converter.

A: This app is a QT app according to this thread, so QT is ok I in the MAS I guess.
However this doesn't shed any light on wether alternative languages are allowed in the MAS.

A: QuickAlarm was primarily written in MacRuby along with some Objective C routines.

A: There are loads of electron applications. WhatsApp is in the Mac App store, for example.
Perhaps it isn't in as an obscure programming language as you might have been thinking of but nonetheless, Electron is an option other than Objective-C or Swift.
