Q: Font Book does not Install all fonts My Mac decided to delete all but 19 fonts, which is fairly annoying. It didn't really delete them, as in I still have the original files in the /Library/Fonts folder, but they've disappeared from Font Book, so I can't use them. 
Now, Apple says that you can select a folder to install all fonts in that folder, but when I try that, the spinning wheel (not the beach ball) comes up in the lower right hand corner for a few seconds and then leaves, without installing any fonts. The same thing happens if I use the + sign in the menu bar, select multiple, or if I try validating and then installing (actually, that installs one font). 
Is there any way to mass-install these fonts or will I have to install them one by one?
System info: Mac OS X 10.5.8 running Font Book 2.1 (123).

A: I'll bet you have a font corruption problem.


*

*Split the uninstalled fonts into two groups.

*Import the first group.

*Check to see if they imported successfully.

*

*If yes, you know the problem is in the second group, so go to step #1.

*If no, the second group might be okay, so try importing that.



And so on.
You should be able to narrow down the problem without having to import each font one at a time. But my guess is that one or more of your fonts is corrupted.
