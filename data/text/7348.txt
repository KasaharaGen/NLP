Q: Where can I test a path? I have tto check a path like "volume1:FTPRoot:StenRoot:Stnp00:A12:B38:f000031913". Is there an easy place where I can paste this to unsure me that this path is valid ? 
PS / I can follow it manually, but I want to automate this...

A: Shift + Command + G (Go To Folder) can help you. This article has other handy keyboard shortcuts in the Finder. Hope this helps.
