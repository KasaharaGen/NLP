Q: Will Photoshop CS version 8.0 work if I update from Tiger to Leopard? I have just baught an Iphone and I have to upgrade my itunes, but it says my operating system is too old. I have an Ibook G4 10.4.11 with a 1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 processor. The support team are sending me out a disc to install Leopard operating system. However, I am worried that once I install it I may not be able to run Photoshop CS version 8.0. Will this be an issue, as I use it everyday. If so, I am thinking of returning the iphone.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I heard that there maybe issues with intel based macs, but I think mine is PowerPC...

A: Yes, 8.0 runs even in Snow Leopard.
Also:  look in the Help menu and see if there is a "Deactivate" choice.  (I think 8.0 is before that started, actually.)  If so, then you should deactivate Photoshop, install the new OS, then activate it again.
