Q: What iOS games use multi-touch in an innovative way? I am looking for iOS games which use multi-touch in such a way that is not possible to emulate on other systems. This does not include games that use multi-touch to emulate a button and analog stick controller. So far I have found these apps:


*

*Eliss - pinch in and out to combine planets

*Sway - Left/Right side of screen to dedicated to each arm of the character

*Cross Fingers - Must use multiple fingers on some levels to hold blocks out of the way


A: After more research I have found these games:


*

*Galcon - Swiping multiple weapons to different enemy planets at the same time

*Bed Bugs - Swiping away multiple enemys

*Pinch 'n Pop - Very similar to Eliss

*Pinch - Looks similar to Eliss but with a maze component

*Touchgrind - It is also available for OSX but way harder due to not being able to touch the screen directly

*Touchgrind BMX - From the makers of Touchgrind

*Buggled - hold down as many bugs as you can?


I made this a community wiki so edit away.


*

*Meeblings - Using two fingers, you can activate two of those little guys at once.


A: *

*UZU (iPad only) - 1 to 10 finger inputs

*Tesla Toy (similar to UZU but for iPhone)

*Foodies - two fingers maintaining a continuos contact; 


A: Check out Pangolin on IOS. - action puzzler that use two fingers to make trampolines
