Q: How do I keep my session when I reboot in OS X? When I reboot my machine, I'd like it to reopen all my programs and windows, and put them back in the same place, after restarting. how do I do this?
(I'm on 10.6, and use spaces)

A: ReLaunch does what you want. Also see a similar question on SuperUser.
The only major limitation of Relaunch is it does not (yet) support Spaces (virtual desktops).

A: You can start as many application at startup by adding them to your Account Prefs :

For the windows... I don't think there is an easy way to do it. But if it's some documents, you can added them the same way.

A: I started an Applescript to start up the applications that make the core of my day, though I need to add in more functionality like opening specific URLs and folders (though it wouldn't be hard, I just haven't had the time).
tell application "Firefox"
    activate
end tell

tell application "Versions"
    activate
end tell

tell application "NetNewsWire"
    activate
end tell

I saved it as an application, named it "AM" and it sits on the far left of my Dock. I come into my office in morning, wake up my Mac, and click the icon.
