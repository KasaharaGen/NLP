Q: Is there any way to get a generic (country-unrelated) iTunes link? When copying links to stuff in iTunes or Mac App Store, I always get a countrycode-specific link. Is there any way to get a generic one?
If not, will those links resolve to national-specific iTunes destinations when people from abroad click on it?
E.g, might this lead to some other store except the Swedish one?
http://itunes.apple.com/se/artist/nash-the-slash/id160526527

A: I think there is a better way to this, as it is described here:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1633
You can use something like:
http://appstore.com/<appname> for example, http://appstore.com/keynote

A: You can remove the country code from the URL, so it reads http://itunes.apple.com/artist/nash-the-slash/id160526527. That gives you a valid iTunes URL, that if opened in a browser (that doesn't auto-open iTunes), appears to be the same as if the link were a US link.
However when any iTunes link is opened in iTunes itself, it will attempt to redirect to the version in the user's local store. I.e. when I click on the link you posted, I get sent to the same item in the Canadian store.
If the item isn't available in the Canadian store, I get a message like this:

So, you should be safe using country-specific store links, and iTunes will handle the redirection as appropriate.

A: A "generic" or "global" iTunes / App Store link has less to do with the two letter country code in the URL and everything to do with ID.  
If the link is recognized / available in the "target" iTunes / App Store country specific storefront you are golden, if not you just served up an error message. 
For example (look at the IDs in each link): 
Apps (Tetris from EA):


*

*US - http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tetris/id479943969?mt=8

*UK - http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tetris/id480807857?mt=8
Music (Adele's 21):


*

*US - https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21/id420075073

*UK - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/21/id405293187

*CA - https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/21/id403988688

*JP - https://itunes.apple.com/jp/album/21/id413208801

*BR - https://itunes.apple.com/br/album/21/id477022345
We (GeoRiot) have found that "artist" links (either for a musician/band or app developer) are your best bet for an ID that works internationally but still don't have 100% success.  
For specific products, we've found the following rates of links not working for international clicks (based on top 300 items in each category, originate from a US based iTunes / App Store link and tested in the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan storefronts): 


*

*8% to 12% of the time for Apps 

*65% to 75% for Music 

*50% to 75% for Books (native language plays in here)

*60% to 85% for TV shows / episodes (again language is a major factor)

*50% to 98% for Movies (language again playing in big here)


If you really want to dive into the specific availability of a link then you can check out this tool we put together: GeoRiot Link Availability Tool (beta)
I hope that helps! 

A: sorry for being so late, I recently needed the solution as well. I found this old (legacy) link where it was supposedly explained, but it is incorrect.
The right answer is mentioned here https://support.google.com/admob/answer/3086746?hl=en (for Apple and Google) and for iOS you just need to use a URL such as this:
https://apps.apple.com/app/id##########

Example: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1564353382
