Q: Changed Lion Server's host name and now unable to browse to that site (Without thinking much) I set up my Mac mini server and used an actual domain name I use as the computer's host name. 
I've since changed the host name to something that isn't an actual website, but I'm unable to navigate to the original hostname/domain. I've tried changeip in the terminal as well, as well as flushed DNS in case it was cached there as well.
How do I get Lion to reach out to the WWW to find this domain?

A: I was able to fix this by removing this from /etc/named.conf
I'm now able to navigate to example.com.
zone "example.com" IN {
    type master;
    file "db.example.com";
    allow-transfer {
        none;
    };
    allow-update {
        none;
    };
};


A: In terminal enter:
hostname -fs

That will tell you the hostname of your machine. You may need to edit your hosts file:
sudo nano /etc/hosts

If your machine is listed in the there simply remove it and then control-w to save the change.
