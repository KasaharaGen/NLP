Q: Conditional SUM() based on text of a cell using iWork I have some basic data
Name | Amount
Jake | 10
Jake | 12
Jake | 13
Ben  | 1
Ben  | 14
Ali  | 9
Ali  | 4

I want to total up the amount for each person so I end up with something like
Jake | 35
Ben  | 15
Ali  | 13

Rather than specifying which cells are Jake's, Ben's and Ali's I want to do this using a function. Pseudo code might look like:
TOTAL = WHERE `Name` IS "Jake" IN `COL-A` + `Amount`


A: It would appear that SUMIF() does exactly this
 =SUMIF(test-range, “test”, [sum-range])
