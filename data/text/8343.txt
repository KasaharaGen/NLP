Q: Jailbreaking an iPad 2 with iOS 5 Is it possible to jailbreak an iPad 2 running iOS 5? Please let me know if it's possible. If so, how do I do it?

A: Currently, the answer is no. It is fairly widely known that the A5 is a fairly difficult nut to crack.

The 4.3.1 untether works on all devices that actually support 4.3.1
  except for the iPad2:

As for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, both devices run Apple’s new A5
  processor, which is proving to be an absolute bitch to jailbreak. Only
  the iPad 2 can be jailbroken under iOS 4.3.3 using the userland
  JailBreakMe v3 exploit. If the iPad 2 is any example to go by, don’t
  expect the iPhone 4S to be jailbroken any time soon.
