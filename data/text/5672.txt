Q: Image dimensions not showing in item info on second drive On my second drive image dimensions do not show. On my main drive they do.
Is there some way to enable that? 
Thanks a lot.
EDIT: The second drive is 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)'. If i make a new folder on the drive and paste a pic in it works, but others it not. Yes, i have checked "Show Item Info" in View Options. 
it shows item count and some file size info but not image dimensions
EDIT2: its just a folder tree on a drive that not show it... if i rename the tree they show, rename back and they stop showing. if i copy a file to a new dir or root it shows
how to change or reset what shows where? i tried adding and remiving from spotlight privacy window but

A: As with thumbnails for movies, dimensions of images lots of times don't load until they are either opened, or left highlighted for a bit. I went through my images and found many didn't have dimensions either. After highlighting them for a minute or opening them with preview however, the dimensions showed. So chances are Finder doesn't open the file to find the dimensions until it needs to.
