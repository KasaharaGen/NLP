Q: Are there personal finance applications offering both an iPhone and a mac version? With the demise of Cha-ching, I find myself in need of an application for managing my expenses which I can use on both platforms.
It should work in Europe, and maybe have a decent UI.

A: Add MoneyWell to the list

A: You have iCompta which is the one I use. Well followed by its developer, with upgrades and a quick support through dedicated forum.
I must admit I was used to Money on PC and wanted to have something which doesn't change my (good or bad) habits too much. It's a good one for this.

A: iBank and SplashMoney do what you want. I haven't tested either.iBank looks like a nicer interface, but costs a lot more.

A: Not an application but mint.com runs in any browser on the desktop and has an iPhone app. Mint is like throwing all of you money up in the air and it lands in neat little stacks with labels. Mint is free.
I have no affiliation with Mint, I just like it.

A: iBank is a very good desktop application and I found it to be a more than adequate replacement for Microsoft Money when I moved to the Mac.
There is a companion iPhone app which I haven't used yet, but apparently it can sync to the desktop app via WiFi (Bonjour), MobileMe and any WebDAV server. (If they supported DropBox it would be ideal for me and I'd have bought it by now).
(Edit: I should add that I downloaded and evaluated iBank against MoneyWell - for me iBank won hands down though for the life of me now I can't remember why. I think the overall experience just seemed better).
HTH,

A: I use You Need a Budget. It's a great little app, and also has a mobile version that is really nice.

A: I just found out http://www.squirrelapp.com/, which looks quite bare-bones, but has the required features.
