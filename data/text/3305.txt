Q: ITunes volume noticeably lower than browser volume Can anyone think of a reason why (and a possible solution) the volume on my ITunes player is lower than other apps (like for example playing videos on youtube or music in grooveshark)?

A: Perhaps you're not aware that there is a volume slider on the iTunes window?

Also, Are you using an Equalizer? (Window -> Equalizer)
Change the preamp setting if you feel it is too quiet.
