Q: Mac OS X Application to Float a Window in Front of Others It would be nice if it was a button you could press on the top right that 'tacked' the currently selected window in front of all other windows permanently (until the button is pressed again).
Does something like this exist?

A: Not built into the OS, but you should take a look at Afloat from Infinite Labs.
