Q: iPhone app to apply Instagram like filters to a photo and save to camera roll Is there such an iphone app which gives me multiple filters to apply to a photo and save it to photo library camera roll (syncs to iPhoto later).
It appears the photos are stored inside the Instagram app only when they get uploaded to the Instragram servers.
I read the description of Hipstamatic on iTunes but I'm hesitant to buy it as it doesn't seem to have the option I want.
Better yet, is there someway to save the instagram photos to photo library apart from mailing them one by one. (Too many questions I know)

A: In Settings > Instagram you can specify that you want to save the original picture and the picture modified in the photo library.
If you don't want to upload your files in Instagram's server, try Camera+. It's a great app and really worth the 99 cents.
NB: there's also a free Camera Plus app, it's not the same as Camera+ and I haven't tried it.

A: Here is a solution which actually works. 
(Basically, the solution is to not take the picture with Instagram, but to open the picture from the camera roll and filter/crop it from there, and it should automatically save back.)
