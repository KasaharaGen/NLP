Q: Tell Safari to Download Certain File Types? There are certain file types that Safari automatically opens natively.  Various kinds of video files, for example.  Is there a way to configure Safari to not open these files and instead default to just downloading them?
I'm using Safari 5.1 on OS X 10.7.1

A: I don't know about permanently, but you can hold down the option key when clicking on a link, and that will always download it instead of opening it.  Similarly, if you put a URL into the address bar and type option-return, that will download it as well.
