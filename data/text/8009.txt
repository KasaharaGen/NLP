Q: How can I add an audio menu in the Finder? What is the easiest way to add menu item to finder that switched audio from internal to external(headphone). I have to switch back and forth often and going into control panel every time is a pain in Snow leopard. Is there a way to do this with Applescript?

A: You can ‚å•-click the volume menu in the menu bar to quickly select which audio output device to use.

A: There are two ways that I know of.
Hold option and click on the volume icon in the finder to get a list of input/output options.
The other option is to download an app called SoundSource.
