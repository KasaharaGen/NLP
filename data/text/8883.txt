Q: Wrong Apple ID for iCloud? My initial Apple ID was associated with a now defunct email address. I just updated my AppleID to a real email. I have managed to update it successfully with everything except iCloud on my phone. The App Store, iTunes, everything else on my phone has the correct ID except iCloud. How do I fix this?

A: Settings -> iCloud (right beneath General). Then scroll down til you see the "Delete Account" button. Should be straight-forward from there.
