Q: Is there an attribute that can show which process created a file? Now, I can find out which processes are opening files dynamically.  However, for a file on my filesystem, is there a way to find out which process created the file?
I'm trying to differentiate a file I created by:
touch(1)

from one created by say, an NSAPI process running under my id.
lastcomm(1)

will give me information such as which tty is doing something, is that an attribute I can access?
Essentially, my id does a bunch of stuff.  Much of what my id does should be via applications, or from a terminal.  I'd like to find out more.  Suggestions?

A: Darwin is open source. I'm guessing you'll need to modify OS level things, a kernel extension, etc. and add this ability. 
Or you could modify the dynamic-view tools you know (fs_usage and/or lsof), have them check if a file is being created, and append the process chain that created it into the Spotlight comment, etc.
