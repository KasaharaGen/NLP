Q: How can I change mouse button to work with Safari? I got a Mac-mini but I'm not using Mac mice, I have a Razer Imperator mice. Checking under System Preference, there are only options that allow modifying scrolling speed, and tracking speed. So my question is how do I modify the left/right button of my mice since I want to navigate back and fourth between pages within Safari. Plus, I also want to change the scrolling behavior, it's completely opposite with Window, I scroll down, it goes up, I scroll up it goes down :(.

A: With BetterTouchTool you should be able to re-assign all the buttons as you wish for a particular program or system-wide.
