Q: Extending Warranty - AppleCare Protection Plan I have a problem with the phone screen.
I set up a repair with apple today and I noticed that the warranty expires in just 3 days.
Would the repair be handled as a warranty or am I expected to purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan to ensure that the repair is treated as within warranty
thanks for your help

A: as long as your case is documented by the Genius before your warranty expires it will be covered under warranty (as long as there are no signs of physical or liquid damage.)  in some cases a Genius will cover items under warranty even a few days after it has expired.

A: What @Ryan said is correct, however, if you intend to purchase the AppleCare, you are supposed to do it before your one-year warranty expires. If youâ€™re in Europe, you have two years with/without AppleCare, by law; unless you made the purchase through a company (i.e. the invoice is a company and not an individual).
