Q: Monitoring and disconnecting users from an AirPort Extreme Does anyone know a simple way to monitor who is connected to an AirPort Extreme, see the bandwidth they are using, and the ability to disconnect them or throttle their bandwidth usage?
I know for disconnecting two options would be
1. updating wifi password and restarting the AirPort Extreme
2. setting a limit by MAC address
but I am looking for something that wouldn't involve restarting the AirPort each time.

A: Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a native way to do this.
With regard to detailed bandwidth monitoring, the Airport Extreme supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) so if you want to put in a bit of effort, you could set up Cacti http://www.cacti.net/ and point that at the base station.
As far as remote disconnection of users, there is no way that I know of short of the two options you mentioned.
