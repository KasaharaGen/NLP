Q: Time Machine Backup to Samba Share under Mac OS Lion In earlier versions of Mac OS you could enable TimeMachine to use Samba-Shares as a Backup-Target using this:
defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1

and create a backup image with this script.
Sadly Time Machine now says that my drive does not support the necessary AFP protocol. 
Is there a workaround for this? 

A: Suspiciously named Msftguy has written a program that fakes the required AFP features for unsupported volumes.  AFAIK this is currently the only way to use non-AFP volumes with 10.7 lion.  Use at your own risk!

A: I used this blogpost as a guide, and it works quite well: http://basilsalad.com/how-to/create-time-machine-backup-network-drive-lion/
The approach is to create an HFS+ drive image on the network drive, mount it using tmutil, then use it with Time Machine.  Since the drive appears to be HFS+, there should be no issue with using older AFP versions or even SMB/Samba on typical NAS drives and Linux servers.
