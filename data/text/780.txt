Q: Macbook: Flashing Folder with Question Mark At Startup So, I've been hearing a clicking sound coming from my macbook for about a week now. The last few days the system has just been locking itself up when I try to type anything.
Now, at startup I see this: 

I'm assuming that the clicking was "the click of death" and my hard drive is fried. Or am I wrong?

A: That's the most likely scenario.
Have you tried booting from a system disc? I'd recommend doing that, and then running Disk Utility and see what it says about the drive.

A: not necessary:) 
your mac just cannot where your OS is,
check here and if not helps, reformat HDD and install fresh OS

A: My MacBook is an older one - OSX 10.5.8 . It has had the "folder of death" problem twice recently.  The first time I tried all the "fixes" recommended but to no avail.  I did not attempt wiping the HDD. I put it aside for a couple of weeks and was surprised to have it come good after that. Today it went bad again.  The clicking noise sounded like the HDD was stuck somehow.  So I gave it a thump on my knee and it booted normally.  I don't know if this cure is repeatable or works in all cases but for me it put off the inevitable trip to the Apple store for a while.
