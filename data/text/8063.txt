Q: Is the font in Messages.app changed in iOS5? The fonts in the Messages app look much better in iOS5 than in iOS4, and wanted to confirm it. I couldn't find any discussion or note about this online. I don't have a phone running iOS4 around to compare myself.
Has it really changed? Any sources?

A: Same font, but Apple added a very subtle text-shadow and tweaked the bubble reflection. That's the difference.
iOS 4

iOS 5
