Q: How can I make Safari show the URL when I hover over a link? Safari 5.0.1 on OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) doesn't seem to have any status bar in which the URL of a link shows when the user moves the cursor over a link (without clicking)   All other browsers I've ever used do this.   
Is there a user preference checkbox somewhere for this?

A: There are two options. One is a setting, and the other is a workaround.
Here are instructions on how to toggle the setting using the Menu Bar:


*

*Go into the View menu.

*Select "Show status bar".

*Now, there will be a URL that pops up when you hover over a link, and also tells you if it's going to be in a new tab:



You can also press ⌘ + / to toggle this setting at ease.
The second option is a workaround for when you drag links. Here's how to get this feature to appear:


*

*Click and drag the link out of where it will originally appear.

*At your mouse will be a small box telling you the title of the new window and its URL, although it may be shortened.

*You can also drag the link to the plus sign in your tab list, out of the window, or in a folder/the desktop to open that URL in a new tab, new window or save it to your computer, respectively.


A: I believe this Safari Extension did precisely what you are looking to do, but it's now abandoned:
Ultimate Status Bar.

A: The URL of links your hover over is shown on the gray status bar at the bottom of the page. The status bar is not always present in a new window, but you can turn it on from View > Show Status Bar or with the ⌘/ shortcut.
Some pages can hide the status bar and it does not restore if you go to a new window. However File->New Window should always show this.
