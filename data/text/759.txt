Q: Why won't iTunes update my iPod Touch from 4.0b to 4.1? My iPod Touch shows the icon for "I won't do anything until you connect me to iTunes." When I obey, iTunes tells me:

The software on the iPod has expired and must be updated to a newer version.

So I go to click the "Check for Update" button. But when I do, iTunes tells me:

This version of the iPod software (4.0) is the current version.

When I click the "Restore" button, iTunes tells me:

There was a problem downloading the software for the iPod. The requested resource was not found.

The current version on the iPod is 8A274b (4.0 beta), which has, of course, expired. I just updated iTunes, so I have the latest version of that. Does anyone know how I might fix this situation?

A: If you have the 4.0 beta, you are able to download the 4.1 GM from developer.apple.com and use Xcode's Organizer or iTunes (by holding the option key when clicking restore) to choose the correct version of iOS (which is on the disk image you downloaded) to reload onto the iPod.

A: If you are running the beta, then you more than likely have a provisioning profiles on the phone. Make sure all expired profiles are deleted and you have a current, valid one installed. I've had issues related to those in the past.

A: I'm loathe to post this here since it's related to a jailbroken write-up, but seeing as how you've really no alternative, you might want to try the following to downgrade:

Careful, though. This might brick it and then you'll really be in a mess.
After downgrading, I imagine the update process will get you correctly back to 4.1.
