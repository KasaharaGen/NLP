Q: HID Compliant TouchScreen for OS X 10.6 Does anyone know of an HID-compliant touch screen that will work straight out of the box with Max OS X 10.6 without requiring any drivers to be installed?

A: Google found a couple of possibilities; I haven't tried them myself:


*

*NextWindow - Touchscreen 2700

*Planar Touch - Touchscreen LCD Monitor - PT1710mx 17" Monitor
There's the Wacom Cintiq; while I believe they need drivers I'm sure they'd be available close to day & date.
And an entirely different approach to take might be the Axiotron Modbook.

A: Would you be happy with an HID-compliant touchscreen running another OS (or OS X with drivers installed), and then a full-screen VNC to your driver-less OS X machine? You might not be able to tell the difference.
