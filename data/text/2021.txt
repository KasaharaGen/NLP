Q: Does Safari for iOS 4.2.1 support WebGL? Does iOS 4.2.1, the latest release at the time of this question, support WebGL?

A: Not at this point, no. WebKit, that which Safari for Mac OS and iOS are both based on, is supposed to support WebGL but I have yet to be able to get it work properly on Mac OS 10.6, much less iOS. I get the impression the whole thing is too new (relatively) for proper support.

A: WebGL resources:

Looks like its only in Webkit, and even then you have to enable it:

A: I would not get your hopes up of iOs ever supporting WebGL. Not only because exposing the video drivers to untrusted parties poses a security risk. It would also give game developers a way to circumvent the app store for distributing games. Same reason you will never see the flash support extend beyond anything but video.
