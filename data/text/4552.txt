Q: Restore Trash (~/.Trash/)? I accidently deleted the ~/.Trash/ folder. How I fix this?
I do not want to:


*

*Restore files currently in the Trash can

*Restore files emptied with the Trash can


A: Open Terminal.app and type
mkdir ~/.Trash

It will create a new empty folder that Mac OS X can use to store trashed files; this won't save any old deleted files from the original .Trash folder you deleted.
