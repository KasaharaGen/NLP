A: I myself use OS X's Quick Look. I think it's good enough.
Just select your xls (or xlsx) file and do one of the following:


*

*press Space

*press ⌘ Y

*right click and choose Quick Look


and the file will be viewable in a separate window. Press Space again to close.
Quick Look can also be opened in full screen by pressing ⌥ Space or  ⌥ ⌘ Y in the Finder. Press Esc to exit full screen.
