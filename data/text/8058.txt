Q: Is there a human-readable summary of Apple's Terms and Conditions? Just went to update my apps on my iPhone and it looks like Apple have updated their Terms and Conditions and Apple Privacy Policy. It's currently at 62 pages!
Has anyone read it thoroughly and can give a short summary of any important items for users? I appreciate this won't be a legal answer (that'll also take 62 pages) but a general summary would be handy, e.g. am I promising to go on their mailing list or something like that?
Clarification: the best answer won't be legally accurate (because only the T&C themselves are) but it will state if there are any gotchas or weird stuff users should be aware of.

A: Apple has on their website the latest versions all of their legal documents on their website: http://www.apple.com/legal/. Some of those pages offer summaries of the policies, but not many of them have that.
At the same time @Mark makes a valid point: there is a reason why these legal documents are so long. If you want a summary, then it would be best to have a lawyer look it over and give you the information you need. I think any take away from their documentation is that Apple is very restrictive when it comes to their branding, content, technologies, processes, and the like.
