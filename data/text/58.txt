Q: iTunes on Windows Refuses to Upgrade I've been having a problem when trying to upgrade iTunes on Windows (7 x64). Every time I try to upgrade it, I get the error message:

QuickTime was not found.
QuickTime is required to run iTunes. Please uninstall iTunes, then install iTunes again.

Wanting to upgrade to 9.2 to get iOS4, I obliterated anything to do with Apple from my machine and reinstalled successfully, but this error comes back time and time again.
I recently found that I am not the only one suffering from this.
Is there a way to solve this issue or am I doomed to stay like this forever?

A: It seems like the installer expects Quicktime to be there but when it looks it can't find it. 
Have you tried removing any registry entries to do with Quicktime and retrying the install?

A: I have the same issue. iTunes on Windows 7, installed with default configuration months ago. After that I have upgraded it several times successfully, again with default settings. Now the latest iTunes upgrade offered by Apple Software Updater suddenly fails with "QuickTime required" error. iTunes and QuickTime Player fully working, only upgrading to latest version fails.
