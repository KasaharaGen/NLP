Q: Want to post an iphone 4 video on youtube, but it needs to be rotated I filmed something with my iphone 4 by rotating the phone so that it looks wide.  Like a widescreen TV.  But when I upload the .mov to youtube, the video is sideways and tall & skinny.  How do I rotate it?  Is there a setting in iPhoto or quicktime I can configure?  Or on youtube?
I'm surprised, Apple always makes things so easy... I would've imagined the camera software would recognize I started filming rotated and saved the picture as such...

A: *

*Quicktime allows you some basic editing options such as Edit > Rotate

*iMovie allows more options such as cropping, rotate, trim, etc.
When you view your video in Quicktime is it in landscape format? If not, it's possible the phone was vertical (portrait) when the recording started. The camera should oriented either landscape or portrait before pressing record.
