Q: Is there an app that will let me edit track information (title/artist)? I wonder if is there any app for the iOS 5 that will let me edit the artist or title of my music?
The music is currently synced through iTunes and stored in the music app, but please let me know if there are any alternatives. I am open to jail breaking the device if there are no other alternatives.

A: Given the rather strict sandboxing applied in iOS this is most probably impossible to achieve without jailbraking the device.

A: To date, it is still not possible to edit song metadata on an iOS device, nor it be recommended if it was possible. Songs you get from sources directly onto the device (Spotify, GrooveShark, iTunes Store) all contain correct information. If you have damaged metadata inside media you've acquired elsewhere, look into software that will clean it up before syncing it over.

A: Thumbgenius just released an app called TuneUp that does exactly this and more.

A: To follow up on @patrix's answer, this Yahoo Answers post indicates that there isn't currently any app that will do it, even on a jailbroken device. This Stack Overflow post also indicates that there are no APIs to do this at the moment.
However, there are music editors like Houkusai (iTunes link). In its app description, it claims to:

  
*
  
*Import tracks from your iPod music library
  

However, it's likely to be overkill for what you're looking for, since it's meant to be a music editor and not as a track editor.
In summary, in a search for track/id3 editors, I've found only applications that will work on a computer, not on an iDevice.

A: If you want do it with iOS program, you have to jailbreak it.
Also you can try iTunes, MediaMonkey or other same software

A: YouTubetoMp3 - allows you to name artist, album, etc. metadata and then import to library, even if one already exists.
