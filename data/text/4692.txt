Q: How do I hide folders in OSX? Is there a way to hide folders in OSX like you can in Windows? And if so then how?

A: Any file or folder that begins with a . will be hidden by default, although you can use a utility like TinkerTool to override this.

A: The command-line way:
Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities) and type
chflags hidden /path/to/folder

replacing /path/to/folder with the POSIX-style path to the folder you want to hide (for example, a folder on your desktop called test would be ~/Desktop/test).
To unhide it, type chflags nohidden /path/to/folder.
The freeware way:
I haven't used it, but I've seen the app Hide Folders, by Altomac.

A: In terminal enter the following to show hidden folders:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder;

This will make all hidden folders visible, and will also allow you to prefix a folder with "." directly from finder (making it hidden).
To hide folders again, enter the following:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder;
