Q: How do I get Google Notifier (Mac) to report the number of new messages in Priority Inbox? I'm using Google Notifier for Mac 1.10.6.879 and I want it to report the number of new messages in Priority Inbox. Previously, I had Notifier report the number of unread messages that had a certain label assigned to it (it was a quasi-Priority Inbox). I set up the notifier by going into terminal and typing:
defaults write com.google.GmailNotifier Label -string "LABEL"

When I substitute out LABEL for Priority Inbox, it doesn't provide an accurate unread count:
defaults write com.google.GmailNotifier Label -string "Priority Inbox"

Doesn't it make complete sense that Google Notifier and Priority Inbox should work together?!

A: I think that the label GMail uses for the Priority Inbox is "Important". Have you tried using that?
