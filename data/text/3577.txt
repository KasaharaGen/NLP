Q: Are there any apps on Cydia specific to AppleTV? Just wondering are there any apps specifically for AppleTV on Cydia. I have jailbroken my AppleTV 2 and am looking to install XBMC to get 1080p playback, as well as a browser. Are there any other apps out there? Please let me know.  
Thanks!

A: Perhaps pedantically, I'd like to point out that while you can play back 1080p video through an Apple TV 2, you will still get 720p output. From the XBMC FAQ:

At present, though the ATV2 can decode
  1080p video (using Apple's private
  VideoToolBox API for
  hardware-accelerated decoding), it is
  limited to 720p output. The 1080p
  video is decoded, then down-scaled in
  hardware to 720p.

Slightly off-topic, but I find Plex to be a superior Apple TV client to XBMC. I prefer the Plex interface to XBMC. You will, however, need to set up a Plex server, as Plex for iOS is a client that needs to hook up to a server, which does media management and transcoding as needed.
