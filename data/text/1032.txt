Q: Anyone have any experience installing Corsair CM3X4GSD1066 memory on a Macbook Pro mid 2009? Is the memory compatible for use in the mid-2009 aluminum unibody MBP? 
Reference: http://www.corsair.com/products/valueselect/default.aspx#notebook
The specification is compatible, but from my research, there are at least two conflicting user reviews on this matter:


*

*Amazon product page, which said that it is compatible, but failed after five months.

*newegg product page which says that it is not compatible, however it does not specify the MBP in detail.


Sorry I can't provide links for newegg & amazon page, don't have enough rep.
Thanks in advance.
