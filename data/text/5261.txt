Q: How can I capture video of my iPad, while making touches visible? I want to capture some video of my iPad.
Doing this via VNC on a PC seems like a good choice.
However is there a possibility to make my touches visible?

A: Display Recorder from the same author does exactly that.
Thanks to Vaccano.
