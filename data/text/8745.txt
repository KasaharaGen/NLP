Q: iPhoto crashes on import Every time I import photos with iPhoto, it crashes!


*

*I have no idea how to diagnose. I used cleanapp to remove all traces of iPhoto

*I just purchased http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/ to try rebuilding and importing photos, but no luck

*I have created and removed about 10 libraries, and still no luck

*It's always creating folders called "iPhoto Library Recovered Photos"


Every time I try to import it just crashes.

A: If you are using iPhoto '11 9.2, you are not alone. The upgrade to 9.2.1 this week fixed this for me.
