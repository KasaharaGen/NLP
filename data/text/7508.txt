Q: Reverse Resume Functionality for Safari I would like to reverse the resume keys for Safari. i.e.; Command-Q should quit and not save any tabs (since that is what I normally want to do). Cmd-Opt-Q should save windows.
I know I can disable resume system-wide.
I know I can use 
defaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false

or other trickery (locking the saved state folder) to disable Resume per application.
In this case, I don't want to disable Resume for Safari, I just want it to reflect that 90% of the time, it isn't what I want to do.

A: This is easily done using the normal Keyboard system preference. 
Go into the Keyboard Shortcuts section, then Applications, then Safari
Add the last two and you should be good to go...
