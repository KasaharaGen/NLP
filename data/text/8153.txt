Q: Is there a last.fm app for iOS to submit the music I'm listening to ? Is there a last.fm app for iOS to submit the music I'm listening to ?
Now with iCloud I'm not connecting my devices anymore by cable to the mac, so the tracks are never submitted.
thanks

A: iScrob seems to do what you want on the iPhone. I found after a very brief search, used it for an hour or so after answering this question and found it to be pretty neat. 
With iOS 5 I can see the track I'm playing in the lock screen and control iScrob as I would Music. 

It also displays album artwork on the lock screen:

The only disadvantage is that I can't create Genius playlists.

A: I've found CloudScrop in the app store. When you start it it automatically looks for any music played since the last run and submits the tracks to LastFM.
