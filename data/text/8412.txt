Q: How can I keep apps "always on top" in Lion? With past versions of OSX, I used Afloat, but ever since I moved to Lion, it stopped working for programs like Evernote & Chrome.
Does anyone have a suggestion for a program that will let me keep any other program's window 'always on top'?

A: It's a boring answer, but it looks like Afloat has been updated to support Lion:

A: I use for it expanding to whole desktop without thinking about this. 
Does your software support for lion full screen?
PS: I've found perfect article at OS X daily: http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/22/enable-full-screen-support-all-apps-os-x-lion-maximizer/
This software allows full screen for any software that doesn't support full screen mode natively
PPS: Chrome and Evernote have support lion's full screen mode natively.
