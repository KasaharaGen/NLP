Q: Can OS X play AMR files? I have an AMR-format audio file which I recorded with my HTC Desire. I would like to send it to somebody who has a Macbook Pro. Will he be able to play it without jumping through hoops?

A: QuickTime Player claims to open AMR files.  I don't have any AMR files to test it, though.

A: I'm sure, VLC will play them.
