Q: With Pages '08, can I add a top border to a title? I'm writing my resume with Pages, and I'd like to know if (and how) I can add a horizontal line across the page before every text segment with a certain style (namely, "Header", though that shouldn't matter).
Will I necessarily have to draw a straight line myself, and move it around each time a section enlarges?

A: This is possible in Pages '09, so it probably works in Pages '08 as well.


*

*Select a heading in your document

*Open the Inspector (in menu bar click View -> Show Inspector)


*

*Select the Text section

*Select the "More" tab

*Under "Borders & Rules", click the dropdown that says "none" and select the line you want to use

*Below the dropdown select the icon depicting the line above the content



*Open the Styles Drawer (in menu bar click View -> Show Styles Drawer)


*

*Since the text is still selected, the heading you're using should already be highlighted

*Click the arrow beside the style

*Click "Redefine style from selection"

Now everywhere that you used that heading will now have a horizontal line over it, and it will automatically appear whenever you insert new headings.
