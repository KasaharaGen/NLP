Q: How do I have my iPhone rotate the homescreen? The iPad has the cool feature of being able to rotate the home screen (screens) with apps on them, I was wondering if this is possible for the iPhone's as well?  If so, how do I do this.  My iPhone is Jailbroken so using a Cydia or equilvalent app is possible.  I'm also looking to auto rotate the lock screeen as well.  

A: SBRotator is a bit awful, but it works.
