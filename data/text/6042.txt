Q: How to delete OS X Lion installer app I re-downloaded the OS X Lion installer app to burn a DVD.  After burning the DVD I put the installer files in the trash.  Now when I try to clear the trash, I get a message basically saying I only have Read Only permissions on the file, and can't delete it.  The permissions don't appear to be editable.  How can I get rid of the file?

A: Have you tried rebooting before removing it from Trash again? That helps in such cases sometimes. 
If that doesn't work, try opening Terminal, and entering:
cd .Trash
sudo rm Install\ Mac\ OS\ X\ Lion.app


A: You can also force quit (press Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + Escape ⎋ keys then select the application from the list) the application used to burn the Lion installer since this locked access to the file thus cannot be completely deleted.
