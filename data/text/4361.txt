Q: Untick the 'Open Safe Files' preference in Safari with Terminal After all the fuss over Mac Defender, I thought it might be a good idea to disable the open safe files option in safari for the users in our network. I'd like to do this with the 'Send Unix Command' via Remote Desktop. 

How can I use terminal to disable this preference in Safari?

A: You can use the defaults application to change the preference for this using the following command: 
defaults write com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads 0
