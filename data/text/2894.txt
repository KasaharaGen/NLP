Q: Pages templates for Resumes I'm looking for some Pages templates for Resume (software developer CV).
Do you have any suggestions?

A: There are built-in resume templates in Pages. Select File > New from Template Chooser

A: In addition to the built-in templates, you can find some good ones elsewhere.
