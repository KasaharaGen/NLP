Q: How do I load specific pictures from iPhone 3G to my PC? I am trying to load pics from my iPhone to my computer, but just want specific pictures. 
How can I choose which ones to download.  I already have several downloaded and so when I go to download the additional pictures I took, it wants to download them all again.

A: I think you might be able to right click on the iPhone icon found under my computer, and select explore.  If so, you should be able to select just the ones you want.
I'm not running windows right now so can't check, let me know how it works out.
