Q: Can I install Spaces and Exposé on Lion? Like many of you, I'm sure, Mission Control isn't quite cutting it for me in Lion. I much preferred Spaces and Exposé. So, naturally, I tried reinstalling them on Lion. I got Spaces.app, Expose.app, and Expose&Spaces.prefpane from a machine running Snow Leopard, and tried installing them in System Prefs and the Applications folder. 
It didn't work. Every time you open up the Spaces and Exposé prefpane, it shows the Mission Control pane. Double-clicking on Spaces.app brought up Mission Control, even if you change the name.
Any idea on how to install Spaces and Exposé on Lion?

A: This is impossible because Mission Control / Spaces / Exposé are actually controlled by the Dock. And you'll certainly have no end of trouble if you try to transplant the Dock between OS versions.

A: You can't, it's Mission Control all the way. I'm actually quite happy with it, and made a pretty seamless transition. What features are you missing? You can do everything with Mission Control that you could do with Spaces and Exposé, with the sole exception of Spaces in rows. You can even assign applications to individual spaces; that option is in the app's dock icon now.

A: I was having the same problem
but all is there,
just need to configure it [ I use the hot corner method]
