Q: Internet browsing problems when the Mac is bound to a Microsoft server with Active Directory I have set up Active Directory on my Mac and I can log in and authenticate fine to the server. When I try to browse the Internet, there is an error which says "The user could not be determined by the Single Sign-on agent". I believe the Internet is filtered through Bluecoat, so I was wondering how to browse the Internet as it's trying to request my Active Directory username but the browser is not picking it up.
I've had a look at the settings in Safari, but I just can't see anything about this.

I tried using Authoxy but I still can't browse or go to the app store. I have no problems with Active Directory as I can log in and can see all the other computers and servers.

A: Sounds like your proxy server requires NTLM authentication (this is a way in Windows where the logged in Windows session is used to transparently authenticate to the proxy). Authoxy supports this on OS X.
