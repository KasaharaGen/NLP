Q: Whispersync-like experience for PDF or TXT files? When I start reading a PDF or TXT on my Mac and continue reading it on my iPhone, I have to waste time looking for exact place where I stopped reading on my Mac before continuing to read on my iPhone.
Is there a web-based app or a Mac/iOS app that would remember where I left off, the way Whispersync does in the Kindle app?

A: Here are a few options you could check out:


*

*Instapaper

*

*Acts a lot like Whispersync for any article you find on the web. 

*You can read via a nice iOS app or the web app.

*You can also forward txt into your Instapaper account via email.

*It's supported by a ton of additional iOS apps.

*You can use actually link it right into your Kindle natively through Instapaper or using Ephemera.

*It does NOT do PDF that I am aware of.


*Simplenote

*

*A slick app to sync text files across devices including your Mac and iOS devices.

*It has lots of third party support.

*It does not do PDF or any of the Whispersync-like reading progress syncing.


*Good Reader + Dropbox

*

*You can sync PDFs and other eBook formats easily between your Mac and iOS devices using Dropbox.

*This solution will NOT do the Whispersync-like reading progress syncing.



As far as I have seen I think Instapaper is going to be your best option for getting a very similar experience to what you're looking for.

A: Voice Dream iOS app was updated to version 4.0 which includes a new feature that will save reading locations to multiple devices using iCloud.
Here's a quote from their notes on what's new in 4.0.

Library Synchronization â€¢ Your entire library, including folders,
  reading locations, bookmarks and annotations are synchronized across
  all your devices using iCloud Drive.

Voice Dream is meant as a text-to-speech app, but it also works well for times you want to read PDFs and other text without speech.
