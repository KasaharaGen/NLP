Q: How to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH? I forgot to turn on "VNC viewers may control screen with password",
to enter on my working Mac,
is there way to turn-on this feature remotely via SSH (I'm on WindowsXP now)?

A: Here is a different way, that enables screen sharing access for all current users, instead of using a single VNC password:
sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart \
 -activate -configure -access -on \
 -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers \
 -configure -restart -agent -privs -all

Disable it with this:
sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off

This allows you to connect to the remote computer from a mac using the share screen button in Finder.

Putty is a good SSH client for Windows.

*SSH into your remote OS X machine with an administrator’s log in and password.


*Enable Remote Desktop (a.k.a. Screen Sharing, a.k.a. VNC) with this command:
sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart \
-activate -configure -access -on \
-clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes \
-clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd \
-restart -agent -privs -all



*Login using a VNC client. As I mentioned, TightVNC worked for me;
for some reason, RealVNC and UltraVNC didn’t.  Your password is
“mypasswd” (see the -vncpw flag in the above command;  you can and
should change this).


*When you are done, turn off screen-sharing using your SSH session:
sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart \
-deactivate -configure -access -off
