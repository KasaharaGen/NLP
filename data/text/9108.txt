Q: Dropbox syncing RTF-editor for iPad with color markup possibilities I'm looking for an app for iPad in which you can:


*

*Sync with dropbox

*Save and edit RTF-files

*Color markup text (in addition to making text bold, change fontsize, et cetera)


A: I think you're looking for something like Textastic, which can sync with Dropbox, FTP, SFTP, etc and does code highlighting for code & markup and has a customizable keyboard area.
