Q: Not able to download game applications from App Store Since I got my iPad and iPhone I am unable to download certain applications,
especially the games
Is this due to region restrictions with Apple and South Africa?
Apple recently released the iPad to South Africa and in the Apple Store I see the iPad have Angry birds, etc. loaded on them.
But if I try to download it from the App Store I can't.

A: Per my comment above, apps simply do not show up (in iTunes itself, anyone can view the web-page overview versions) in iTunes if they are not available in your region.
If you do follow a link to the app specifically, you should get an error message explicitly stating that the application is not available.
Any other message indicates some other problem entirely.
