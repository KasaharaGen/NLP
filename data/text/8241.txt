Q: Can you copy location metadata from one photo to another in iPhoto? Some of my imported pictures don't have location data on them because they were created using apps like Diptic. I'd like to tag them with them location data but the 'Assign a place...' search dialog in iPhoto is doing a poor job of finding the location the photos were taken.
I have pictures in my iPhoto library that have the exact location information that I'd like to assign to these location-free photos.
Is it possible to copy just the location metadata from some pictures to others?

A: Yes, it's very simple.


*

*Select the photo you want to copy the location data from and hit CMD+C to copy

*Right click the photo you wish to paste the location

*Select 'Paste Location' from the contextual menu.
