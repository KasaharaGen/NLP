Q: How to use Gmail contacts on an iPod Touch I have an iPod Touch 4. It easily lets me set up the Mail and Calendar apps to use my Gmail account, but I can't seem to find a way to get the Contacts app to use my Gmail contacts. Am I missing something or is it not possible?  Seems silly that it wouldn't let me use my Gmail contacts with my Gmail account.

A: You need to set it up with Google Sync.  There's a step-by-step guide on the Google Sync Support Page
