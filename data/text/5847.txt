Q: Is it possible to change the Finder sidebar icons I know you can change the icons of files, folders, etc, but in the sidebar folders appear the same. Is it possible to give them a custom icon for the sidebar like the Music, Photo's, Movies, etc folders have?

A: If you are on El Capitan I think you have to disable SIP first:
1.Restart your Mac.
2.Before OS X starts up, hold down Command-R and keep it held down until you see an Apple icon and a progress bar. Release. This boots you into Recovery.
3.From the Utilities menu, select Terminal.
4.At the prompt type exactly the following and then press Return: csrutil disable
5.Terminal should display a message that SIP was disabled.
6.From the ï£¿ menu, select Restart.
