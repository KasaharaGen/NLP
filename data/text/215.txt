Q: How can I unpack a .deb on Mac OS X without installing it?  I have a .deb file that I want to unpack and examine, but not install. I'm currently looking for where i can download dpkg for OSX, but can't find it. If you have a link, please share.

A: ar is already installed on my mac on OS X. So just do
ar -x path/to/deb/file.deb

that's it. No need to install other software.

A: You can install dpkg using MacPorts or just download the sources.

A: While not OSX specific, if you have Docker for Mac installed, you could use an Ubuntu container to look inside the contents of the package:
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
dpkg -c /data/foo.deb


A: if you use MacPorts you can install dpkg and more package (like do it in debian or ubuntu).
after installing Macports go and install dpkg from here.
also you can find more info about dpkg in osx here. (This is now down - I don't know if temporarily or permanently)

A: At least on recent macOS versions, you can also use tar to extract UNIX archives:
tar xf package.deb


A: docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
# or with fish
# docker run -it -v (pwd):/data ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
cd data
dpkg -x wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb out
ls out/usr/local/bin/

works well for wkhtmltoimage and wkhtmltopdf
