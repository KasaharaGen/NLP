Q: Can I import my old podcast MP3s into iTunes? The title pretty much says it all.
If I have 25 podcast MP3s, how can I associate them with the podcast in iTunes?

A: In iTunes it's possible to label items as Podcasts. To do so:


*

*Import your items into iTunes if not done already

*Select them all and choose Get Info from either the contextual menu or the File menu

*Go to the Options tab and set "Media Kind" to Podcast

*It will then appear in the Podcasts section using the Album name as a group
