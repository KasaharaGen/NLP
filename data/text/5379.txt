Q: "Open folder in new window" for Finder? In Finder, how do you open a folder in a new window, while the existing window keeps the same view?   
All file managers I've ever used (on Linux only) have something like "Open folder in new window" in the right-click menu for a folder.  Does Finder have this feature in a hidden way, or is there another file manager I should be using on Mac?

A: Right-click on the folder, hold âŒ¥ (Option), and select "Open in New Window".
If you'd prefer this to be the default (and hold Option for a new tab instead), you can change it in Finder preferences.

A: Just hold down the Command key (Cmd) while double clicking the folder and it will open in a new Finder Tab.
In Finder Preferences, you can specify to open in a new window instead of a tab.

A: Command + Click on a folder opens what ever items you have selected in the current window. So if you have 3 folders selected, you will open each folder in a separate window - Annoying in some instances, but very useful in others. 
Otherwise you can goto Finder > Preference and tick the "Always open folders in a new window" option. 

A: I typically would tap 2 fingers on the Finder, and choose "New Finder Window"
That is assuming you enable Two Finger tap to trigger Right Mouse Button click
