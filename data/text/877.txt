Q: How do I change the PIN on an iPhone? A simple one, I guess:
I recently bought a new (unlocked) iPhone, and at the same time changed my phone subscription to another operator. How can I set the PIN code on the new SIM card to something other than the default? With a quick look, I couldn't find anything related in iPhone settings.

A: The setting to change SIM PIN can be found under Settings app → Mobile Data → SIM PIN and not under Settings app → Phone.

A: You can find the option under Settings > Phone > SIM PIN.
