Q: Is there a bluetooth phone that can remain paired with iPhone? What I would like to do is find a bluetooth capable phone that I can pair with my iPhone and will remain paired even if my iPhone is paired with a bluetooth headset at the same time.
I had purchased the AT&T phone model TL92278, but, if I forgot to turn off my headset just before I returned home, the phone would no longer be paired with my iPhone. It was easy, but annoying to have to pair it again constantly.
Basically, I am wondering if there is a phone out there that can remain paired with my iPhone while my iPhone is paired with a headset.

A: I have had good experience with Uniden. They make a range of phones that pair to your iPhone via bluetooth. They are good for incoming but have not yet worked out how to make outgoing calls through them.
