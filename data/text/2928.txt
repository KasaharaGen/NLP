Q: How can I make the OS X privilege escalation popup less annoying? I am looking for a way to make the root privilege escalation procedure less annoying - I have to type the password too many times.
Is it possible to remember the password once per login session or to remember it for a specific period of time? Or to have the dialog but not require you to type the password?
Remark: I'm looking for GUI solution, for console sudo I do have a solution.

A: Mac OS X's authorization rights and behaviours can be adjusted through the /etc/authorization file.
You must take care when altering this file; mistakes can lock you out of your Mac. There are instructions at the top of the file to get you started.
To extend the period of time authorization is granted, look for the appropriate timeout field and increase the value as needed.
