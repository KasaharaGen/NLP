Q: Can I use tethering to share my iPhone's connection with my iPad? I own an iPhone 4 and I am planning to buy an iPad. I am wondering whether I'll be able to use the tether feature in the iPhone to access the internet from the iPad over Bluetooth. If this works, I won't need to get a 3G-enabled iPad; if it doesn't, I'll need a 3G iPad. Any ideas? Thanks.

A: iOS 4.3, available for free download on March 11, 2011, includes the Personal Hotspot feature introduced with the Verizon iPhone 4. You can get Internet access via 3G on the iPhone, then use your iPad via a WiFi connection to the phone to share the phone's Internet connection. It doesn't use Bluetooth, but it effectively works as well (better, in fact, since Personal Hotspot supports multiple connected devices and WiFi is faster than Bluetooth).
Here is a story from Macworld that discusses how the Personal Hotspot feature works. It's pitched to the feature on the Verizon iPhone, but it should apply to the GSM iPhone 4's running iOS 4.3 as well. 

A: iOS doesn't support getting internet via tethering, so it won't work via Bluetooth. But iOS 4.3 brings WiFi hotspot to iPhone 4 so you can use that to get internet to the iPad. 

A: a note: This wifi hotspot will cost you more money through AT&T, as I understand it.
If I am correct, and you currently have an unlimited data plan grandfathered in from an original iphone plan, that change will change your data plan too! Be careful what you do and call and/or talk to an AT&T rep in person to confirm/negotiate what you want!!!

A: I too have no internet via bluetooth when Iphone4 (4.2.2 and 4.3) is tethered to Macbook .  This appears to be broken in OSX 10.6.6 and 10.6.7.  10.6.5 was fine.  Wifi tethering with 4.3 works from Macbook.  However for Vista (Sony) and XP (Acer mini) I get wifi tethering but no internet connection.

A: Bluetooth tethering is available via "MyWi" for iPhone/iPad (Requires jailbreak on both devices) Though it works great.
