Q: What is iTunesHelper? In my account settings under Login there is an app called iTunesHelper. What does this app do? Can I remove it from the login apps without affecting iTunes, or will it be put back?

A: It is a program that launches iTunes whenever an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in. If I recall correctly, if you remove it, iTunes will no longer automatically launch when an iPhone/iPod/iPad is plugged in.
