Q: Keeping the GIMP tool bar on top? I've seen a lot of discussion about this through googling, but found no answers. In GIMP for Mac, I just want to keep all the dialog windows above my main document window. Is it possible?

A: You could use the SIMBL extension, afloat. I use this tool all the time, especially when working with reference images and the like.
