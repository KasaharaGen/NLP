So I want to be able to add appointments/events/tasks on either and have those changes reflected on both.

A: You should really use Google Sync for iPhone to have all the benefits of Calendars (and even Mail if you need it).

A: In iCal, add a new CalDAV account.
Description: Google:you@gmail.com
Username: you@gmail.com
Password: yourpass
SERVER SETTINGS
Server Address: www.google.com
Server Path: /calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user/
Port: Auto
Use SSL: CHecked
Make sure you have sync enabled in iTunes.
