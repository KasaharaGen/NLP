Q: Refreshed MacBook + BootCamp unable to boot restored Windows 7 partition I recently had my MacBook's HDD crap out on me. The OS X partition, in particular, quit working, but my Windows 7 partition was still in decent enough shape for me to grab an image. I got a replacement drive from Western Digital and restored the Win7 partition. I am able to see it from Mac OS X and am able to select it as a boot target with the Boot Disk tool, but when I reboot the machine, I get a gray screen for a few seconds and then a fully black one with simple white text reading "No bootable device -- insert boot disk and hit any key..."
Any ideas on what I need to do to get my Windows partition back up and running? I don't want to try a reinstall from the Win7 DVD (which I believe I've misplaced anyways) and Boot Camp Assistant doesn't offer any other alternative.

A: Sounds like a problem establishing where the bootable partition begins.  Insert the Win7 dvd, boot up from it, and do a "startup disk repair" - which should not touch apps or data on the partition, but should restore the umm, boot-ability of said partition.
