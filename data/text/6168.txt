Q: Is it possible to "update" iTunes? Is it actually possible to update iTunes running on Windows 7 Ultimate?
Because every time I've tried, it fails with an error about one service or another. The error is usually related to not having sufficient permissions to modify the service, even though my account is configured as Administrator, and the service varies.
The only way to get the latest version installed consistently is to manually uninstall everything, reboot, then run the installer.

A: Just remove the iTunes app and redownload it from apple's website. If you just remove the app it should leave your media files untouched but take a backup just in case.

A: First, have you installed all the Microsoft security updates to Windows 7 using Windows Update? For instance, are you up to Windows 7 SP1?
Also, have you tried disabling (or "snoozing") your anti-virus software for the time it takes to run the iTunes installer? Conflicts with an anti-virus program would be the most common cause of failing with errors about one service or another.
I have updated iTunes several times on numerous computers running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, and I have never encountered the problems you describe.
