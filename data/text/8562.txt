Q: iTunes share Library not Loading Correctly I turned on home sharing on my iMac & I want accessing my library from my iPad. The setup went smoothly and I was able to access my Library from my iPad but some of the content isn't showing up correctly. To be more specific some TV shows are listed more than once and some others are not shown at all. How do I fix this.

PS (All my devices are running the latest software)

A: To solve this problem & set the artist of all shows to the name of the TV show & set all episode IDs in the form of S#E# (season number & episode number)
PS. when setting the episode ID of the first 9 episode write the as "05" not just "5" else they will not be sorted correctly.

A: iTunes combines TV Shows based on the available metadata (Title, Series etc.). I've included a sample based on the "The Office Season 8" Sneak Peak below to give you an idea about sensible values.
