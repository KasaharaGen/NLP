Q: iPhoto '11 is really slow to launch Ever since updating to iPhoto '11 it has become incredibly slow to launch. Using it is acceptable performance wise, but launching is terribly slow. I just closed it and reopened it to get an accurate time, and it too 3 and a half minutes! BTW, it only does the bouncy thing for a minute, then it just sits there. At first I ended up launching it multiple times because I thought it wasn't opening.
It is a 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mac Book Pro with 5 GB of RAM.
Everything else launches in an acceptable amount of time. Even iMovie is much faster. I have a fairly large library (75 GB), but it isn't any larger than it was before.
I've emptied the iPhoto Trash. Anything else I can do to speed it up, specifically launching?

A: Try rebuilding the library.
