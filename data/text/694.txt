Q: Is it possible to redefine what Keynote interprets as bold and normal for a particular font? When working in Keynote I like to use medium and light fonts instead of bold and normal. This causes me a problem because when I hit apple-b to embolden something I want the font to be switched to medium instead of bold, but the default is the bold font. Is there someway for me to either a) redefine what a particular presentation interprets as bold and normal or b) assign a different shortcut key to switch the font between medium and light?
UPDATE: An option c) occurs to me too: could I copy the whole font somehow and play around with its definition to replace normal with light and bold with medium?

A: To answer directly to your two questions: 
a) No, you can’t redefine what is bold and what is normal as far as I know, Medium and Light are different styles than Regular and Bold and there isn’t a keyboard shortcut to set them (nor a menu item for that) and because of the latter, you can’t set a keyboard shortcut. 
b) Because of (a), you can’t really do this.
A (lame) alternative is to use Copy Style cmd+alt+c and paste style cmd+alt+v. But that requires that you find a piece of text that has the same size/font.
Also having the Formatting bar visible makes it easier (albeit with the mouse) to change that: shift+cmd+R.
