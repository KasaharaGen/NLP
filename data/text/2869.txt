Q: Disable Safari plugin without (re)moving the file I've been Flash-free in Safari (5.0.3, my primary browser) for a while now, using Chrome with its bundled Flash Player whenever I have to.
I'm also developing a little bit in Flash for school, and have ended up using the Flash Debug Player, since it's really convenient to use trace for debugging.
I tried just putting the Debug Player inside my Google Chrome.app, similar to how the existing Flash Player is located, but Chrome refused to detect this, so I had to put it in /Library/Internet Plug-ins, and now Safari detects it too.
Is there any way I can get Safari to ignore this plugin, or something that makes sure Chrome can find it, and not Safari?

A: Maybe just use the clicktoflash extension (also available from Safari Extensions Gallery)?

A: You have to rename the Flash debug plugin, in order to be available to Chrome.


*

*Go to 'Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/10.0.../Internet Plug-ins' 

*delete the 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'

*put there your debug 'Flash Player.plugin'

*rename it to 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'

*restart Chrome
