Q: How do I delete forward on a Macbook Pro? I know this:


*

*Fn + backspace - "del" key (delete letter to the right) <-- where's the Fn key in the MBP?

*Alt + backspace - Delete last word

*Command + backspace - Delete whole line


Now... there is no Fn Key on a MacBook Pro. What key combination should I use, or it's a matter of simply: It's not possible?

A: I use crtl + K  to kill the rest of the line, effectivly deleting all text after the cursor on that line.

I suspect you've just missed it, as noted in CajunLuke's comment. I checked several international keyboards as well.

A: As an alternative to Fn+delete, you can also use control+D to trigger a forward-delete, at least in most places.  Some older apps may not support it, apparently.

A: My MacBook Pro had a Fn key at lower left, and the pictures I can find confirm this (the keyboard changed several times and mine was an early model).

A: Don't forget the software keyboard viewer in case your hardware key for function is moved or you might have an international keyboard instead of the standard US layout.

A: Once again Keyboard Maestro comes to the rescue.  I set Shift-Delete as a hotkey to trigger a fn-delete keystroke.  Works a charm.  
Keyboard Maestro is worth the price for the time saved.  For instance, I set 1 to backspace twice and type my email address,2 returns my wife's email address, etc, etc.
