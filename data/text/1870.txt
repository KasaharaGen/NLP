Q: Keynote on the iPad does not to the projector (VGA output)? On an iPad, when we hit play for a Keynote presentation while connected to a projector via VGA cable, the app closes down.
What tricks are there for getting iPad-Keynote to work with a projector?

A: we called Apple they said we need to re-set the iPad

A: It might be the file: have you tried another presentation? It may have altered in some way during the translation such that it displays ok on the device but fails when output.
Is the projector you're connecting to 1024 x 768? I've had it work with a projector of another size, but it only sends an image that size. It's not likely, but perhaps there's a VGA sync issue that's crashing the app.

A: Turn off the iPad (shut down) and then turn it on again. It worked for me.
