Q: How can I view the full name of drop down items on iOS? For a dropdown list on a website, iOS shows only the first few characters and then ellipses for items with a long name. Is it possible to somehow see the full text of each item?

A: You could try selecting the item and then viewing the dropdown list in view mode, not selection mode. But As far as I know there is no way, in selection mode, to change how Apple presents the choices.

A: Other option is to turn your phone to a landscape mode...
