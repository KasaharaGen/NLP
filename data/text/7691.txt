Q: Can you triple boot on Mac OS X Lion (twice) and Linux? I'd like to install two separate version of OS X Lion and a copy of Linux on my Mac.
How do I go about doing this?

A: *

*Open Disk Utility & select the drive you want to install your OS on.

*Open the Partitions tab & add 2 partitions by clicking on the
little "+", then arrange the partition size as required

*Make sure to name your partitions so not to get mixed up later

*Click apply and wait for your partitions to get created.


For Lion:


*

*Run the installer & when it asks which disk you want to install; choose show all disks & pick the one you want


For Ubuntu:


*

*You probably have a bootable disk to install ubuntu. Insert the disk & restart your computer while pressing down "c" this will boot from CD. (It might take a long while to boot from CD). Run the ubuntu installer & when you are sued to choose a drive to install on choose accordingly.
