Q: How can I re-download all the apps I bought on another store account? I have moved to another country, which comes along with the joy of moving apple store accounts. This would be easier, however, if there were a trivial automated way to re-download all of my free apps under the new ID.
Before going any further, I know that I'll have to re-purchase any in-app purchases, and that no process is going to get me my apps back free. It sucks, but there it is.
I've written a small tool to list each app in my library and identify it by owner, price, and store URL. The thing is, I want to take the one extra step: Re-purchase the app from the store, under the new account, and replace the old one. Right now, this process is painfully manual:


*

*Delete the existing app

*Open the store URL in my browser. This opens iTunes to the app

*Buy the app

*repeat ad nauseam
I've got almost 150 apps to do this with. It'll take forever.
Is there an easier way to bulk delete/redownload apps in iTunes?

A: Check my story:
Do I need to repurchase apps if I moved countries?
In short - you can't. You have to stick to your old account for updates of the software you bought and create a new AppleID for purchases in new country.
Unless of course you are willing to pay for all applications (and in-app purchases) again. Then there's no need to have another AppleID, you just switch store country, but there's no automation for re-buying them unfortunately.

A: No solution for a new account. But you don't need to use a new Apple account, you can just sign in on your old Apple ID. That way all your existing apps are already authorised and you don't have to re-download them.
Or if you've already deleted them, they will show up as purchased.
