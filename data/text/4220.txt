Q: How to convert a CorelDraw file to Adobe Illustrator CS5? Assume I have a CDR file, Adobe Illustrator CS 5 and no CorelDraw. How can I convert this CDR file to AI file? What is the fastest and cheapiest way?

A: Download Corel trial version. Import all cdr files and export as AI. 
job done !

A: The free program Inkscape can open many .cdr files and can export in a variety of formats that Illustrator can read.

A: Try to export as .eps file. This will open in Illustrator.
It works fine for me!

A: Very simple...change the .CDR code to .EPS
it fools Illustrator into thinking its a eps vector file and opens easily

A: I have tested two applications: Inkscape V0.48 and LibreOffice Draw V3.6.4.3. Both are able to open CDR file and save/export it as an SVG vector graphics (and PDF eventually too). The SVG is listed as a supported format for Adobe Illustrator.
Both programs I used are Open Source and free.

A: If you happened to get such files often consider converting them on a Linux machine. You can set up a virtual machine and use the Inkscape for Linux. Probably it is not the best method though.
