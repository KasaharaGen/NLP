Q: Which is the most powerful fan less iMac that uses a CRT for the display? I am planning to use it as jukebox but I just know that apple started selling fanless iMac from 350mhz model...
When did they stop doing fanless imacs?
700 mhz?
I just care about crt models.

A: It's hard to beat a fanless iPod and a set of fanless speakers for the power of great sound. I'm in love with my iPod HiFi and a Belkin Bluetooth receiver for when I don't want connect my iPod through headphone or dock connector.
It won't satisfy your CRT interest, but I suppose no answer can be perfect... ;-)
