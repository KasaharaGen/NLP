Q: If I plug my ipod to another computer's itunes, my musics will be deleted? I'm thinking about use Ubuntu's Rythmbox to synchronize music, but I need the iTunes from my windows to get some apps.
If I plug my ipod to a windows with no musics on it (to get my apps), my musics will be deleted from ipod?

A: In my experience, it asks you. You can say no. However, I'm not sure if this requires Manually Manage Music to be checked in the Summary tab.
As always, make a good backup just in case.

A: I can confirm what Nathan G. reported. I have a computer with Windows, and when I plug my iPod on that computer, it says me it is already synchronized with an iTune library; it asks me if I want to synchronize it with the library present on Windows, warning me that the content of the iPod will be deleted, if I decide to do so.
I didn't select Manually Manage Music in both the computers.

A: Go into the Preferences of iTunes.  Under the Devices tab, there is a checkbox for "Prevent iPods and iPhones from syncing automatically".  Make sure that option is checked and you are in the clear.
