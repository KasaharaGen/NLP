Q: Can't see my downloaded app on iPad I bought the Spark Radio app through iTunes and apparently it was downloaded, but I don't see the app on the iPad.  How can I get the app I purchased to appear on teh iPad?

A: If you can see the app in iTunes but not on your iPad, it means that it didn't sync over. Make sure it is selected as an app to sync.  Alternatively, try downloading it using the app store app on your ipad.
