Q: Using OS X Lion - Migrating from Mobile Me to iCloud - Incoming Mail Server issue I have gone through the steps to migrate from Mobile Me to iCloud on my Mac.  The incoming mail server (p99-imap.mail.me.com) is grayed out and cannot be changed.  According to Apple Support, that is not the correct incoming mail server.  Thoughts?

A: In mail - preferences - advanced - uncheck 'enable this account'. 
click another account or tab to get dialogue box to save changes.
check 'enable this account'
