Q: In Lion's new Mail.app, is it possible to change the font size of the mailbox list? I have a small screen and MANY email mailboxes. I'd like to make the side panel font size smaller, but I can't find an option for it. Is there one?
(I can change the font size in messages and in the message list--that's not what I'm talking about.)

A: This thread says System Preferences -> General controls it.

A: this was already answered, but you can go to Mail.app > Preferences > Fonts and Colors > Message List font to change this.
