Q: How can I enable rEFIt boot volume choice after waking up from hibernation mode? There are pretty clear answers to the question 'How to put my Mac into hibernation mode voluntary', but there is still an issue for me.
I use Bootcamp Windows and rEFIt to select which sistem to load. But when I wake from the hibernation mode I have no option to choose - just Mac OS is loading. How can I enable boot source choose after waking up from the hibernation mode?

A: Here seems to be a good explanation of the process.
Might be a tad old though :)
