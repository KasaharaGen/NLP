Q: iPad: disable animations Is there any way (perhaps involving jailbreaking) to disable all (or at least some) of the transition animations on iPad?
Examples: Homescreen fly-together animation, sliding animations in apps

A: Answer: there is no way to do this.

A: If you install FakeClockUp and set it to 10x, it almost feels like the animations are disabled.
