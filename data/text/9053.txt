Q: How can I get rid of duplicate TV shows in my iPad’s list of Home Sharing shows on my Mac? I’ve got a Mac mini running as a media server-type thingy. It’s running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and iTunes 10.5. I access TV shows on it via my iPad (running iOS 5.0) using Home Sharing.
(The Mac mini is plugged into an Airport Extreme via ethernet, and the iPad accesses it over wifi.)
A little while ago, the list of shared TV shows on my iPad seemed to get a bit screwed up. Several seasons of one show were listed several times, and seasons of shows sorted after that show don’t appear.
I’ve disabled and enabled Home Sharing on the Mac and the iPad, restarted iTunes and the Mac, killed the Video app on the iPad, and restarted the iPad. Still, the list is screwed up.
However, the list of shows is fine on the Mac mini, and on my primary Mac when accessing the TV shows via iTunes. So I’m assuming it’s an iPad problem.
Has anyone else come across, and found a fix for, this problem?

A: Unfortunately Home Sharing videos on iOS has had some issues for a while now - TV shows out of order and in some cases duplicates. To my knowledge there isn't a proper fix, but some people have suggested that signing out of Home Sharing then back in again on the iPad (i.e. removing your username and password) can fix it some of the time.

A: I just fixed this issue on my iPad. Shared TV Shows had many repeats, one couldn't navigate. This all came from the items I'd ripped from DVDs that I'd purchased on put into iTunes.
Setting the Artist and Album Artist fields to something appropriate for the show fixes it. (select the similar shows in iTunes and use Command ⌘ + I to edit them all at once) 
Done!
