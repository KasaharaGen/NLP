Q: Does the new Macbook Air have a 1000 battery cycle limit? I know that since 2009 Apple has been advertising the 1000 battery cycles that'll last for around 5 years under normal use for Macbooks and Macbook Pros. I don't see them advertising it in the new Macbook Air, is it the case that they have the same long lasting battery or not?

A: Yes their design limit is to exceed 1,000 full charge cycles. Quoting from Apple on batteries:

The built-in battery of your MacBook,
MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed
to deliver up to 1000 full charge and
discharge cycles before it reaches 80
percent of its original capacity.

I have been bowled over at how well the internal battery chemistry holds up over time. Of course, bad batteries fail prematurely all the time and need to be swapped, but my gut feel is way more of these "go the distance" than all the older removable batteries.
