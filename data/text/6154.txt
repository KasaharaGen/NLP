Q: Switch between full-screen windows of the same application in Lion Is there a keyboard shortcut in Lion for navigating through my open full screen Xcode projects? âŒ˜~ is not working.

A: I can switch between windows of the same program by dragging four fingers left or right across the trackpad.  This is analogous to pressing [Command] + [~] when the windows are not in fullscreen.
You can find this setting under System Preferences>Trackpad>More Gestures.

A: You can switch between spaces using ctrl + left right arrow keys, but this can be used with all spaces not just Xcode

A: This is not the perfect solution as its a paid one, but this software called Which fills this gap. As this is truly a bothersome problem (I often use five or six RDP connections at one time in full screen) I thought I would mention it.
disclaimer : I am not affiliated to this program.

A: You an also use Ctrl+Number to switch to a numbered desktop.  However, full-screen apps are not given a number and so can't directly be used with this technique.  However, if you like the approach, you could manually resize XCode to fill a desktop without actually using full-screen,

A: You can also do the swipe two fingers left/right mouse gesture to change between full-screen windows of the same application. See Settings>Mouse>More Gestures

A: BEST SOLUTION, but NOT NATIVE:
Witch for Mac

*https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/17185/witch
it will do exactly this and let you customize exactly which shortcuts keys to switch between any windows of same app, just those in foreground, just those minimized, or many other combinations of those and much more functionality:

A: my 'toolbox' for these problems are:


*

*Use maximize instead of fullscreen (alt+click_on_green_icon) so I can use ctrl+1/2/3/4 and

*Double-tab with two fingers in the dock to get app-expose.

*use mission control or four-finger-swipe or ctrl+left/right

*the app hyperswitch so cmd-tab AND alt+tab or cmd+^/~ is usable again.

*the app hyperdock

*hardly using but also helping: the app ubar (not so sweet) or witch, already named.


A: https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos does this.
https://github.com/mandrigin/AlfredSwitchWindows might also work, but I have not tested it.
