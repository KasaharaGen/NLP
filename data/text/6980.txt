Q: Native RNDIS USB tethering support for OSX Android phones can be USB tethered via RNDIS protocol on Windows and Linux. As far as I understood Apple does not provide RNDIS driver for OSX.
Are there RNDIS drivers for OSX by third party (Android vendor) or community? 
I don't want to use any any app for tethering, I want the real thing, as other operating systems can do it, so please no suggestions for alternative methods.

A: Since then, this driver has come out. It's FOSS too.

A: RNDIS is a Microsoft-proprietary protocol and it's highly unlikely that Apple is going to support it just for the sake of Android tethering.

Your best chance is for a 3rd party to write a Mac OS X driver for RNDIS. Don't expect this to be free (as in beer) though.
However you should be able to use the Android phone as a USB dial-up modem, which was the standard way for tethering before the iPhone came about and still a supported method in OS X and others.

A: horndis is a brilliant solution - just started using it yesterday and it's completely stable
I couldn't get my Andriod phone to work as a USB modem.
I compiled it from source for 10.6.8 then used packagemaker and the included packagemaker project file to create a package to install.
Only gotcha was using sudo su to change the ownership and permissions on the installed kext manually
sudo su
chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext

chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext
