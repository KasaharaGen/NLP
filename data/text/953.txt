Q: How can I get Automator to mount a network volume? I am writing an Automator "script" that rsyncs media on my 10.6.3 MacBook Pro to my Ubuntu 10.10 HTPC. I can make Automator run my shell script for rsync commands, but I can't make Automator mount the three volumes on the HTPC (folders for music, videos, and pictures).
I automatically mount these volumes when I login (these computers connect via a wifi network), but sometimes the HTPC volumes get unmounted, so I'd like to remount by default.
Is there a way to mount the volumes in Automator? I am open to shell scripting, too. Thanks!

A: I build automator workflows like this all the time. You only need two actions, and they're both Files & Folders actions.
1) Get Specified Servers. This will let you build a list of shares to connect to. If you can map it from Finder -> Go -> Connect to server, you can use this.
2) Connect to Servers. This will connect to any servers passed to it (either from get specified servers or from ask for servers).

A: I use the following applescript to mount directories in conjunction with MarcoPolo so network shares are automatically mounted when I get to both my office and home.
You'll need to change USERNAME, PASSWORD, SERVER/SHARENAME and possibly smb:// depending on your server type.
tell application "Finder"
    try
        mount volume "smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER/SHARENAME"
        delay 1
    end try
end tell


UPDATE: An option without MarcoPolo:  You can ping the server first and only try to connect if you get a response.  You can then add this script into your Login Items
(Let's say you are trying to connect to a server named "some_server")
-- (0) Check to see if there server exists by pinging it
set max_retry to 60
set k to 0
repeat while (do shell script "ping -c 1 some_server") contains "100% packet loss"
    delay 5
    set k to k + 1
    if k > max_retry then error "Server is not responding for predefined period." number 8000
end repeat

-- (1) It exists, mount the volume
tell application "Finder"
    try
        mount volume "smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@some_server/SHARENAME"
        delay 1  --Optional, was added due to slow network issues
    end try
end tell
