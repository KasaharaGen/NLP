Q: Is there a way to turn on indicator that a directory item is a shell script in Terminal? When I do an ls of a directory and a shell script is listed as a directory item, is there a way I can have a visual indication that it is a shell script ?
For example:
From /opt/local/bin 
ls -l

Displays port from MacPorts as an ordinary item:
port

Can I have color coding, bold or some other way to see this ?  I know I can use file to check if it's a script, executable, etc., but that's an extra command I have to issue and is no better than trying to run port and then getting an error and typing ./port.
Thanks!

A: Try typing ls -G in terminal, you should see colored listings by file type.  If the scripts aren't being shown in a different color, this means that they are not marked as executable, so you will need to type sudo chmod +x <filename> to make them so.  Then they should appear in a different color as opposed to directorys etc.
If you prefer not to always type ls -G then you can put the following command in your .bashrc file in your home directory  alias "ls"="ls -G"  Then restart terminal and you should see colored output whenever you just type ls

A: You can set this in your ~/.bash_profile file to enable colors equivalent to ls -G:
#!/bin/sh
export CLICOLOR=1


A: As I’m not a fan of colours — they depend on the current terminal colour settings to look good — I prefer to use ls -F.
Borrowing from SCO Unix, I define an lf alias in ~/.bashrc:
alias lf="ls -F"

Executable files such as shell scripts show up with a * at the end of their names. Similarly, / for directories and @ for symbolic links.
