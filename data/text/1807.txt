Q: Reviving a dead iPod Touch 8GB (2nd gen?) I have an iPod Touch 8GB (probably 2nd gen) that stopped working. By this I mean that it cannot be turned on, an doesn't show any sign of activity when connected to the PC, a docking station and other chargers. Of course iTunes does not recognize the device when plugged in to the PC. This happened, without prior signs of a coming malfunction, about 2 months after I bought it, used, during the last summer.
What are my options in trying to bring it back to life? At the moment, buying a new iPod Touch is not an option.

A: Try leaving it connected to a PC or Mac for several hours. If the Battery is completely empty, it will take some time to turn on. Happens to my 8GB iPod (which is not used much anymore) every time I leave it disconnected for 2 weeks or more.
THe only other option I can think of is trying to use a tool called RecBoot to boot the iPod into recovery mode. I don't know if that works (never needed it) and where to download it, but it's the only other option that would come to my mind.

A: If you're sure its charged (try at least 3 combinations of computer->cables, or cable->chargers in case a charger or cable is broken) you should take it to your local Apple store. They will diagnose the problem and fix it if it's in warranty for free. Although you bought it last summer you say it is a Second gen, which means it's probably not in warranty. They will tell you all your options.
