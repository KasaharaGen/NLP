Q: Adding copyright info on each photo using iPhoto Is it possible to add copyright information, or a logo, on the pictures themselves (bottom right corner for instance) for a selection of photos, at once, using iPhoto ?
If iPhoto is not the right app to do it, what would be a free tool to do it ?

A: Your best bet would be to use an application such as ExifShopper, which allows you view/edit image Exif information; It's free and also let's you do batch jobs. I wouldn't recommend iPhoto for doing this, people have complained quite often about it corrupting Exif data, etc.
If you're looking to watermark your images try iWatermark. 

A: I finally found an app that makes it very well; I let the information here for future readers. it's called JetPhoto Studio. And there is free lite version that allows watermarking.
