Q: How do I change a calendar's color in iOS 4.2.1? This is very similar to this question however the only problem is that I'm running solely Windows OS on my PC.  I also only sync with google calendars and that's all.  However, it appears the sync doesn't match the calendar colors.  Is there anyway to synchronize or directly change colors on the iPod/iPhone?

A: A partial-workaround is suggested on this Google thread:

There is a workaround that solved the problem for me.
The iPhone assigns calendar colours in
  this order: red, orange, blue, green,
  purple (then repeats that cycle). So
  the first step is to switch off
  Exchange syncing for Calendars in the
  iPhone settings then go into the
  m.google.com/sync web app and just
  enable one of your calendars. Then
  re-enable Exchange syncing. Now you'd
  think it would colour that first one
  red and it may do in your case but for
  me it coloured the first calendar
  orange, possibly because I had some
  other local calendars already on the
  iPhone.
If it colours your chosen calendar
  with a colour you were not expecting,
  just start again (disable
  Exchange/change sync settings and
  re-enable) and take whatever colour it
  chose as the starting point in that
  cycle above. Once you've got the first
  calendar/colour combination working as
  you like, go back into
  m.google.com/sync and select the
  calendar you want to go with the next
  colour in the cycle. Wait a few
  minutes. Check that it's showing up as
  expected in the calendar app. And then
  go back to m.google.com/sync and
  repeat. If you take this one calendar
  at a time approach, you can assign
  colours as you want them, except of
  course you will face problems if you
  have say three green calendars and no
  purple ones...


A: I just opened calendars in google on my laptop. Changed the colour of it there. Then just clicked the sync button on my iPod in the list of calendars. The colours and name changes just synced. I have iOS 5.1
