Q: How can I convert an AT&T iPhone 3GS to a Verizon iPhone 3GS? I have someone who is not using their AT&T iPhone 3GS. They are willing to give it to me since they have a later model. How can I convert an AT&T iPhone 3GS to a Verizon iPhone 3GS?
What hardware changes need to be made?

A: You can't convert a GSM iPhone to run on the CDMA network, unfortunately. Neither the functional nor the cosmetic components are interchangeable.
If your friend is willing to give you his iPhone and if it's still in decent condition you could probably sell it for enough to fund the purchase of a Verizon iPhone. If it's not in great condition and you still have the urge to tinker, you may be able to find cheap cosmetic parts to restore it to salable condition.

A: You can't.
AT&T uses GSM, while Verizon uses CDMA. The iPhone 3GS only uses GSM, and thus cannot be used for Verizon.

A: You can buy the a CDMA board and still use the screen, microphone, and case. I've done it.

A: It sadly just can't be converted. Back then once you bought it with at&t there was no way to change it to verizon. Also i don't even think it can support at&t.
