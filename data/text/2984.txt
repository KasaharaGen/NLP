Q: How can I erase the history of passcodes on the iPhone4? I have an iPhone4 running version iOS 4.3.  It is not jailbroken.  I want to re-use a previous passcode (the 4 number code to unlock the screen).  How can I get the iPhone to forget all the passcodes I've used in the past?

A: Many times password policies like this are enforced by looking at the most recent N passwords. For example, if a company requires changing your password every month, they may look at the last 12 passwords. I can't say for sure how it is implemented with the iPhone.
A simple trick to get around this is to change your password N times so that the password you want gets knocked off the list and you can use it again. If you don't know what the rule is and how many recent passwords are stored, it may take some trial and error.

A: Same thing happened to me.  I just change the password 5 times, then on the 6th it let me use my original again.

A: Unless you're willing to jailbreak your only option is talk to your company's administrator. That policy is indeed enforced by the company, but maybe you're lucky and the responsible did it without caring too much about it. Anyways...
For changing the policy, try starting here.
For removing the policy with jailbreak, you'll have to read a lot.

A: i reset my passcode 6 times, then reverted back to original. That worked. Not sure if the code then gets stored by 3rd party (in this case a linked email address to a work account)

A: I had to change 10 times before it let me use my original one.  But then, no problem.
