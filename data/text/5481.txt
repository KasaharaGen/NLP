Q: Homebrew breaks with gcc out-of-date after Lion OSX install 
➤ brew doctor

/Developer/usr/bin/gcc

Your gcc 4.2.x version is older than the recommended version. It may be advisable
to upgrade to the latest release of Xcode.

We couldn't detect gcc 4.0.x. Some formulae require this compiler.

$GREP_OPTIONS was set to "--color=auto".
Having $GREP_OPTIONS set can cause CMake builds to fail.

Xcode 4.1 is installed, gcc -v:

➤ gcc -v

Using built-in specs.
Target: i686-apple-darwin10
Configured with: /var/tmp/gcc/gcc-5664~89/src/configure --disable-checking --enable-werror --prefix=/usr --mandir=/share/man --enable-languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/$/-4.2/ --with-slibdir=/usr/lib --build=i686-apple-darwin10 --program-prefix=i686-apple-darwin10- --host=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --target=i686-apple-darwin10 --with-gxx-include-dir=/include/c++/4.2.1
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)

Any idea how to fix this?

A: Until all the kinks get worked out, you'll want to track 10.7 and Xcode 4.x issues at https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues
In this case, be sure you actively manage your $PATH variable to keep your preferred versions of redundant apps first in the expansion.
Always hard coding full paths is tedious, but lack of it causes these bumps when new binaries show up in your path unexpectedly.

A: Just a hunch, did  you run the xcode installer? When installing xcode from the App Store it only installs a xcode installer. You must run the installer to install xcode.
I only ask because it isn't exactly obvious.
The default gcc now uses LLVM. The output of gcc should look something like:

gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)
