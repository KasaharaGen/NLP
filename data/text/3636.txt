Q: An alternative to iPod nano 6g? I'm looking for a good, compact MP3 player that can also double as a pedometer (or at least as a part thereof). I wouldn't hesitate to buy a nano 6g if not for some of its 'features' that I'd rather avoid (expensive proprietary PC cable, iTunes required, and the general creepiness of a closed-source OS). However, looking at the competition, I haven't been able to find a single item that would impress me anywhere near nano 6g. Any suggestions? Thank you.
P.S. I understand that this may be not the most appropriate place to ask this question, given my requirements that must seem unusual for an Apple fan, but I don't really know of a more suitable forum.
