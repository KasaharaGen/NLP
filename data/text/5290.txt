Q: What's the deal with Xcode's price? So... prior to Xcode 4, Xcode was always free. Then 4.0 cost $5 for non-developers. Now 4.1 is free. I'm just a little confused with this situation.
4.1 is Lion only (no SL support). Is 4.1 free and 4.0 is still $5? Are the price tags removed for both versions? I just need someone to clear up the situation a little for me.

A: Here's what we know:


*

*When Xcode 4.0 hit the store - it was $4.99 and ran on Snow Leopard

*Xcode 4.1 hit the store July 20 (Lion launch day) for free but requires Lion. It replaces the prior version so that's effectively not for sale any longer.


Unless you feel someone that has a hand in pricing decisions from Apple will answer here, the rest is speculation.

A: Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The act which was passed after the Enron scandel prohibits companies from adding new unadvertised features to a product after the sale.  Apple has done this with iPod Touch software upgrades, FaceTime, and now Xcode. So in a sense Xcode 4.1 is included in price of Lion.

A: It appears that 4.1 is has been made free; and 4.0 is no longer available in the App Store as it has been replaced with 4.1.

A: You paid for the optional 4.1 dev tools as part of paying for Lion.  Snow Leopard buyers didn't pay for Xcode 4.0, so it wasn't downloadable for free for them (except to enrolled developers who did pay $99.)
Before Snow Leopard, Xcode or Project Builder came on an optional CD/DVD disk that was part of what the customer paid for.  So now it's back to the same (in digital download form) with Lion.
