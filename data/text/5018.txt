Q: Is there an application for Windows7 (in bootcamp) to adjust the level of brightness of screen of iMac? I want to darken the screen of my iMac because it is too bright for me. I use an application called shades, but it doesn't work in bootcamp.
I found the software for Windows Vista called VistaShades (link). Is there a similar application for Windows7?

A: You do not need any software to do this. The Boot Camp drivers from Apple supports changing the brightness of the screen (using the keyboard modifier keys).
The drivers are already included in your Mac OS X DVD for installing Boot Camp Utilities. Otherwise, you can download the installation files using Boot Camp Assistant at /Applications/Utilities.
See here for more details.

A: Apple Bootcamp seems to have an inferiority complex. The solution that I have found to make Bootcamp brightness keys work properly is:


*

*Bootcamp.exe, Properties, Compatibility, Change settings for all users, Run this program as administrator.

*Remove startup item using msconfig for bootcamp (as startup items don't work with run as admin)

*Then create a Task Schedule for Bootcamp run as admin.

A: Even without Apple's BootCamp, you can still dim your screen brightness with the help of the Mac Brightness Control software utility. However, it's NOT free.

A: If you have the Apple wireless keyboard, The F1 and F2 buttons dim and brighten the screen.
