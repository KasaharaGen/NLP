Q: How do I browse /tmp in Finder? I can use the command line to :-
cd /tmp
ls -al

What is the equivalent to do so in finder?
I can't seems find a way to browse to that folder using finder,
(my intention is to view images which I created in /tmp)
Or is there any image browser tools can do the same?

A: You can use the menu Go -> Go to folder and enter the path of the folder you wish to see in the resulting dialog. 
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Cmd + G to summon the dialog.

A: One possible way I just find out is to use browser (chrome, firefox),
and in the URL bar :-
file:///tmp/

This work like apache index directory,
is usable, but is far from ideal

A: Writing open /tmp in Terminal will open the /tmp folder in Finder.
