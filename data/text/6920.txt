Q: RSS app for iPad, that support https? (ssl-over-http) I'm trying to find an RSS-app for iPad, that supports https-protocol.
Tried The Feed and News Reader for iPad, but they don't want to accept links with https proto-supplied(rss generated from Pivotal Tracker, and includes latest tasks for project).
Any suggestions guys?

A: Have you tried Reeder? I don't know for sure that it supports this, but it might be worth looking into.
