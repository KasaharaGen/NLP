Q: iPhone Gmail Exchange Password Error I use an Exchange account to sync my Gmail account to the iPhone's mail app. Recently (the past 2 days or so), every time I try to open the account I get an error that says my password is incorrect. I've reentered the password several times with no luck; I've even verified the password by opening up gmail on my laptop, so I know the password is correct.
This problem was outlined on the FeldThoughts blog, so I tried following his advice to unlock the captcha in google apps, but that didn't do anything either.
Is there anything else I can do?
[Edit] I'm not using 2 step authentication, and I'm using "Google Sync"/"Exchange", not imap or pop. This page explains how I set up Google sync.
