Q: White iphone Home button defect? Recently 1 week back I bought a new white iphone... I have found 1 problem in iphone... Actually the problem is: white iphone home button is little bit deep.. i can feel edges/corner while pressing home button. I think it shouldn't be like that. 
Anyone have faced similar problem ? ... Is this problem with every white iphone devices ? ... or only my device is defective ?
Thanks

A: I can feel the edges of the button on both my black iPhone 4 even when the button isn't depressed - so your description alone doesn't necessarily mean there is a defect (but you should be very happy with your new purchase and it could very well be a defect). 
If you can go to any retail (cell carrier or Apple) store and compare your device to others (or have friends with any iPhone 4 to compare) it will be very easy for anyone to agree if your phone's button is different than the rest. No matter where you bought the phone - Apple will exchange it if the hardware is defective at no cost.
You also can return a new phone to the seller within 30 days - but getting it in the hands of an Apple tech will be the fastest way to know it's covered or a defect - or if it's just a normal variation of the manufacturing process.
