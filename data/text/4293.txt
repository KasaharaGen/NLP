Q: Program for simple editing of MOV files I need a program for editing moves, specifically, only MOV files.
Only simple editing required - cropping, splitting, trimming, etc.
One requirement is that the program does not re-render the video file,
since such changes generally do not need this.
A good example would be QuickTime X trimming facility - you can trim 
a huge MOV file and it will save it in seconds, because it will not
render it again.

A: QuickTime Pro 7 is still around, and can do quite a bit to .mov container files natively. You can select, copy and paste video, extract streams, etc. They removed a TON of features from QuickTime X in the interest of making it prettier and more "user-friendly."

A: Yes, use QT Pro 7, and when you save the file, don't save the file as a self-contained movie, save it as a reference movie. It will take a lot less time. Note that you will need to keep all the original files for the reference movie to work.
