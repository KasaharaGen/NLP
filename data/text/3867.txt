Q: How do I view an SSL certificate on my iPad from Safari? I'm trying to view the SSL certificate for a web site on my iPad.
For example, how can I view the SSL certificate for this site?
https://encrypted.google.com/
Using Safari on the desktop, I can click on the small lock icon in the address bar to view the certificate details.
How do I do this on the iPad?

A: I believe this feature does not yet exist in Mobile Safari -- probably because it's not in high demand, so it's not high on the development priority list.
Try submitting a feature request through the official Safari feedback form (select "iOS" as your operating system so they know you're referring to Mobile Safari): http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html

A: There is an app "SSL Detective". Many professional IT colleagues use this tool:

You can download the SSL Detective app from the Apple app store.  It lets you connect to a URL on a port you specify and it will show you the certificates associated with that site (if any).  An in-app purchase will apparently show more details on the certificates (I didn't purchase the upgrade as the free version worked for my need).

A: There is also a free app TLS Inspector. Works fine too. See https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tls-inspector/id1100539810?mt=8
