Q: How can a bring the windows of an application on the primary display? For some reason my Air still uses its own LCD when the lid is closed, so that I often find that an apps windows are all on a display that I cannot see.
Is there any way of bringing them to the primary display without randomly clicking and dragging in the hope of hitting a title bar?

A: Although the issue is rather strange, you can always take a look at some of the utilities suggested in this stack exchange question. I personally use SizeUp so I'm able to move windows from one display to the other at will (something I do fairly often).

A: System Preferences > “Displays” prefpane > “Gather Windows” button at the bottom right corner.

You can access the Displays prefpane faster by hitting alt and the function key that changes display brightness (exact name depends on your model, so I won't give any here).

A: This is also possible to do using Hyperdock. The preview windows that show up when hovering an application in the dock can be dragged out to wherever you'd like them. This also works across spaces.
