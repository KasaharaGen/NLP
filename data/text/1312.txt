Q: Problem downloading iPhone/iOS upgrade, iTunes complains: "You do not have enough access privileges for this operation" When trying to upgrade my iPhone running iOS 4.1 to 4.2, iTunes displays the error message saying:

There was a problem downloading the software for the iPhone "[Username]'s iPhone". You do not have enough access privileges for this operation.

I kept trying the upgrade process repeatedly, but with no luck. Everything else, including app and music downloads, works fine. I'm running iTunes 10 on MacOS 10.6. What do I do?

A: I found a fix on the Apple Discussions board:


*

*Go to ~/Library/ (i.e. open your home directory, then select the Library folder)

*Get Info (click File -> Get Info or type âŒ˜I)

*If possible, make sure the lock at the bottom right corner of the Get Info window is unlocked

*Make sure the Sharing & Permissions: section is visible

*Where it says "Username (me)" make sure the privilege is set to Read & Write

*In the little tool/wheel pulldown right below, select Apply to enclosed items (say yes, if it asks you if you know it can't be undone)

*Try the upgrade again


This worked for me. Hope it helps!
