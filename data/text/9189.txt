Q: Is it possible to attach a file to an email from the command line? I am often using the terminal, and I'd like to be able type a command that will attach a selected file to an email in mail.app.
:~ mailme myfile

Any idea on how to do that?

A: Works also with Thunderbird
open -a Thunderbird filename

It seems that yout can attach only one file to a new e-mail.

A: The command
open -a Mail.app [filename(s)]

opens a "New Message" window in Mail.app, with the filename(s) attached.
