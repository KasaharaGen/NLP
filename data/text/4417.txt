Q: How to write the names "iPhone", "iPad", etc. in all capital letters? Just curious about whether it is iPHONE, IPHONE, or just never written in all capital letters. Is there a style guide or something on this issue?

A: There is an Apple Publications Style Guide, and it says to not use all caps for emphasis. (Apple Style Guide, PDF)
I can't recall ever seeing all-capital letters in an Apple publication. In the design world, all-capital letters are generally considered hard to read and, in most fonts, ugly, so it's my guess that Apple would avoid the use of all-caps. 

A: As initially mentioned by Neil, the Apple Publications Style Guide is the place to look.
From page 34:

*What to capitalize: Follow these rules when you use title-style capitalization.
  Capitalize every word except:
  
*
  
*Articles (a, an, the), unless an article is the first word or follows a colon
  
*Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, and so)
  
*The word to in infinitives (How to Start Your Printer)
  
*The word as, regardless of the part of speech
  
*Words that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as iPod and iTunes
  
*Prepositions of four letters or fewer (at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over, to, up, and with), except when the word is part of a verb phrase or is used as another part of speech (such as an adverb, adjective, noun, or verb).

That is, the i in words like iPod and iTunes (and iMac, iPhone, iPad, etc.) are never capitalized.
I don't believe that, given a choice, Apple ever uses all caps, although the only specific rule I've found is on page 33:

Donâ€™t use all caps for emphasis.


A: The only official name is "iPhone". If you are putting it in capitals, it is just a matter of choice whether the initial i is uppercase or lowercase. Personally, I think it looks better as "iPHONE".
