Q: How to disable accentuated char suggestion on long click on mac? When pushing a key for a long time, you expect to print a lot of times the same char. 
Instead of that, I now have a popup suggesting all accentuated chars. 
How to disable that and come back to a classic keybaord function?

A: As given in the link by Tom Gewecke, you can disable the Character Picker by typing the following in a terminal : 
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false


A: Open a terminal (e.g. Terminal.app) and write
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

then press Enter.
Any open applications will still use the "Press and Hold", but if you quit them and then open them again they should work as expected (use key repeat instead of "Press and Hold").

A: Pop-over menu also won't appear when the Key Repeat slider is set to Off in the Keyboard pane of System Preferences.
