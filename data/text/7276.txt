Q: How to keep the text selection in Terminal.app when typing In Terminal.app, when I select some text and start typing again, the text selection is gone. I personally find this very annoying. Is there a way to make Terminal.app keep the selection when I type?

A: So, I decided to give iTerm2 a spin after I hadn't looked at it in quite a few years. I have to admit that (with a little tweaking) it's actually a lot better than Terminal.app in many major and minor aspects. I have yet to find something that Terminal.app does better. So I guess that I'll just stick with iTerm2.
