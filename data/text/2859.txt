Q: Can I use Automator or some other method to extract EXIF GPS data from batches of photos on my Mac? I need a way of extracting EXIF GPS data, using my Mac, from a bunch of photos taken on an iPhone.  So for example, if I put 1000 photos into a folder, I want an easy way of extracting all the GPS data for each photo into a text file.
A solution which gets me close will probably be good enough.  I've looked at Automator but don't see a built in way to do what I need.  I have Aperture, iPhoto and Photoshop CS4 on my Mac in case someone knows a way of incorporating those applications.

A: With Commandline tools this is easy:


*

*Install Homebrew

*brew install exiftools  in the Terminal

*find ~/Pictures/ -iname '*.jpg' -print  -exec exiftool -DateTimeOriginal -GPSLatitude -GPSLongitude {} \; in the Terminal


A: There are a number of CLI utilities and scripting libraries available in Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew available to extract and manipulate EXIF data.

A: exiftool can also be used to generate a GPX file which can be processed by other GPX-aware programs. You can download the gpx.fmt template from the exiftool website:
exiftool -p ./gpx.fmt *JPG > output.gpx

Some useful options:


*

*-if makes exiftool only process files with a gps tag,

*-fileOrder allows processing in a forced order,

*-d allows formatting the datatime string.


For example:
exiftool -if '$gpsdatetime' -fileOrder gpsdatetime -p ./gpx.fmt -d %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ *JPG > output.gpx
