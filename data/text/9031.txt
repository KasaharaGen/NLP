Q: What is a good 2D scrolling shoot-em-up for iPad in the style of Gradius V I'm looking for a shooter in the style of Gradius V, meaning futuristic, weapon power ups, frantic action. I'm not interested in a WW1/WW2 style shooter.
Google and the app store are not coming up with any relevant results; any ideas?
Also, iPad specific (can be universal binary of course!), iPad 1 compatible. I have an iPad 1.

A: You can try Space Tripper. It's well reviewed on touchArcade.
