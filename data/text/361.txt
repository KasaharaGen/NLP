Q: xD card is really slow to read in Mac OS 10.6.4 I am having a bit of a problem transferring pictures off my Olympus 850SW digital camera (maybe it being pink has something to do with it).
When using the camera
When connecting the camera to the computer I chose PC>MTP and iPhoto opens and starts indexing thumbnails. It would sit there (iPhoto says "Loading Photos...") and nothing has happened. The LED on the camera is still flashing.
If I chose PC>Storage then the computer does not react at all.
When using a card reader.
If I use an xD card reader similar thing happens. Doing import from iPhoto takes ages for one photo, browsing the car in Finder is equally slow. I can actually transfer files but it's painfully slow - takes about 6 minutes to transfer 50 MB.
What can I do to fix this issue? It strikes me as a system issue (i.e. OS dealing with the memory card), rather than the camera or the card reader.
When using either camera or reader with a PC
Both work fine and photos get transferred pretty fast.

A: Have you tried opening “Image Capture” and see if it works from there? I’ve had similar problems in the past with my Kodak.
