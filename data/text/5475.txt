Q: Where are the dictionaries of Mac OS X's built in password assistant? Mac OS has a built in password generator. It is a little bit hidden behind the key icon in System Preferences / Accounts / Change password. The memorable option is quite nice as it even conjugates words (my screenshot shows the German version):

My question is: Where does this helper get its words and even variants of words? Is there a complex dictionary where it can look them up for the specific language?

A: I've only used OSX in it's English settings. OSX has an inbuilt dictionary for system-wide spellcheck, definitions etc. I imagine it uses this for memorable passwords, with the Size slider determining the limit on the size of the words that are plucked from said dictionary.
