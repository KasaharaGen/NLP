Q: How to check if internal HDD spindle is off after unmount I use SSD instead of optical drive in my Macbook MC516LL, so I have bunch of reasons why I wants to keep HDD's spindle off:


*

*Preserve HDD from shock

*Reduce energy consuming

*Reduce overall system temperature


I use diskutil umount HD250 and it disappears from OSx.
So how can I  check if spindle turned off?
Thanks!

A: diskutil umount HD250 - doesn't turn off spindle
diskutil eject HD250 - turn off spindle
confirmd by sound and mA usage
