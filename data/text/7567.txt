Q: Snow Leopard Time Machine backups are not visible in Lion I upgraded to Lion recently.  I noticed tonight that backups performed on Snow Leopard do not show in the Time Machine interface so I cannot restore from them.  If I browse my backup volume I can see my backups exist right back to December 2009.  How do I get Time Machine in Lion to recognize my old backups?

A: Well, without doing anything apart from rebooting my Mac and my NAS drive the backups are now visible so I wasted 50 points on a bounty I didn't need.  Oh well...
