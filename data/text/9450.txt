Q: Energy Saver preferences keep breaking This is a new question related to a question I asked previously.
MacBook is sleeping despite being set to "never" sleep
Basically, the MacBook would sleep after 3 hours despite the preferences telling it to "never" sleep.
I fixed the original problem by deleting the Energy Saver plist file.
However, after two weeks, it broke again and the original problem came back.  I have no doubt that I can just fix it by deleting the preference file again.
Obviously something external is botching up the Energy Saver preference file.  I'm wondering if anyone can tell me how I can determine what could be causing this problem in the first place.
EDIT:
Trashing the Energy Saver plist file no longer fixes this issue.  I've removed Caffeine and I'm out of ideas.  I can't even effectively troubleshoot this since it takes three hours just to see if it will sleep or not.  What else can I do?  Where else can I look?

A: Perhaps you should try resetting the SMC, as described here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964
