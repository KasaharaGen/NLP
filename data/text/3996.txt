Q: is there a way to disable being able to move icons on an ipod touch my 3yr old son loves using it, but everyday he manages to reorder everything, and places all the objects in 1 folder
I have found how to disable the delete ablitlity, but is there a way to prevent the object icons from being moved
thanks

A: Unfortunately, it is not possible to disable icon movement on a non-jailbroken iOS device.  As great as some of the "child-friendly" apps are, the stock UI of iOS devices is not designed to keep curious children at bay.
You could always load up an app for kids with built-in parent controls.  Then you'd want to protect the Home button from being pushed -- perhaps with a product like BubCaps.
