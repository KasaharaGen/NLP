Q: How to create new mysql user/db in Mac OS X? Can any one please let me know how to create new user and new db in MySQL? How to use mysqladmin in Mac OS X?

A: You can use a GUI client, like Sequel Pro.

A: Thanks everyone. I used the below commands to figure it out.
Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ mysql -u root
mysql> create database tutorialdb;
mysql> create user 'tutorialuser'@'localhost' identified by 'tutorialuser';
mysql> grant all on tutorialdb.* to 'tutorialuser'@'localhost';
mysql> exit
Bye

Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ mysql -u tutorialuser -p

A: If you are using the terminal client, generally you can do things like reset the root users password for mysql or create databases.
To create a new MySQL user:

*

*Login to MySQL in Terminal:mysql -u username


*In the prompt:CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';


*If you want to create a database: create database name; is all you need to do
If you do decide to use mysqladmin, mysqladmin can create and drop databases, but it cannot create new users.

A: You have many choices, you can use MySQL Query browser , or PhpMyadmin.


A: Try, introduce complete path to mysql:
Go to Terminal:
$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u user

I hope help you!
