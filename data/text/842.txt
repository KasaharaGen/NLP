Q: How to delete everything on an iPod Touch? I would like to give my iPod touch as a gift to someone I know, but I want to be sure that there is nothing left on it to avoid giving data with it...
How do I clean the iPod ?

A: *

*Fully charge the iPod Touch

*Go to the Settings menu. Scroll down until you see the "General" settings, and hit that, then scan to the very bottom, where you'll see a mini-menu titled "Reset." Press this. This will bring up a few different options, but the one you want is "Erase All Content and Settings." (Settings / General / Reset / Erase all )


you can see full detailed here.
Also you can use itunes, and go to the restore feature. This will take your ipod back to factory default.

A: I would also suggest renaming the iPod, which you can do by clicking the name in iTunes after you selected it. Then just type the new name. If I recall correctly resetting it does not remove the name.


A: 1, erase all the data from your iPod touch by goning to: Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.
2, restore your iPod touch using iTunes. Refer to the following picture. 

3, use data eraser.
