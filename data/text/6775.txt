Q: How do I make use of the remote disc icon in the sidebar of Finder? I bought the new Mac Mini, which doesn't have a SuperDrive, and I noticed an icon in the sidebar of the Finder: Remote Disc.

To which device is referring?
When I clicked over the sidebar icon with the right button, to get information about the device, I got just genetic information that didn't help me to understand if it is referring to a specific device, and how I can "connect" such device to the Mac Mini.

Can I associate the "Remote Disc" with a MacBook's SuperDrive?

A: Remote Disc is a way for Macs without optical drives (Air, mini) to access another computers optical drive over a network. So you can put a disc in another Mac or Windows PC and read it on your mini.
