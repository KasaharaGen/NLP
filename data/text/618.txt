Q: Why can't I add or edit contacts on my new iPhone 4? On my new iPhone 4, I can add a new contact after talking to them (Add as new contact) but I cannot otherwise add new contacts, or edit existing ones.
It looks like a bug.  Is there a way to work around it, or do I have to wait for Apple to fix their issue?  The phone is not jailbroken.

A: You can use the Contacts application provided in the iPhone 4, and create/edit contacts in there.

A: What's preventing you from doing so?
The ability to add and edit contacts from the phone app is still available.  I tested this just now on mine.

A: It seems that the problem occurs when adding contacts to these phones after updating to IOS 5 (the + sign on the corner right is missing).  IOS 5 added iCloud and if your contacts are not turned ON from the iCloud settings, you won't be able to add, edit or delete contacts.
The Fix: turn ON your iCloud contacts settings from Settings > iCloud and you should see your + sign on the corner back again.

A: I had the exact same problem. Go to settings, then iCloud, go to the 'contacts' switch and set it to 'on' and it will fix your problem immediately. 

A: just go to settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > if there is a accont (hotmail, g mail etc.) just delete the account and then  automatically you can start adding contacts
