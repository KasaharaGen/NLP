Q: Cropping frustration in iPhoto 11 -> iMovie 11 
*

*set up a slide show.

*select 'sliding panel' theme. Set aspect ratio to 4:3

*observe that, on the very first image, the program has chosen a bad crop. there's uninteresting stuff on the right (next to the text title) and not enough of the left side.

*use the hand tool to move the image and fix the crop.

*export to a quicktime movie using 'custom export'

*play quicktime movie with quicktime player

*observe that cropping is now different -- back more or less to the original.

*import into iMovie

*image is then recropped on the left, resulting in complete frustration.


Any way out of this? Is there something about aspect ratio that I don't understand, or is iLife 11 just buggier than a new york hotel?

A: Make sure you have it set to Preserve Aspect Ratio: Letterbox.
