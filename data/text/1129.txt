Q: Is there a hard keyboard case for the iPad keyboard? Is there a hard case for the Apple wireless keyboard for the iPad?
The case is to make the keyboard safe to transport, like in a backpack or something.


A: I couldn't find any hard cases, but Waterfield/SFBags makes some nice soft cases you can use for transporting your Apple Bluetooth Keyboard:

A: I really like the inCase Origami Workstation because in addition to protecting the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard, it unfolds to support the iPad in a comfortable typing position.
Andy Ihnatko included it in A spring selection of iPad-friendly accessories worth a look 
Apologies for the commerce link above. The link is to the manufacturer's site and they don't separate product from store. The Origami is widely available from a number of sources—I picked mine up at a local Apple Store—and no endorsement of inCase as the retail outlet is implied.
