Q: Mail can't delete old email address I recently picked up a used Macbook Pro with Lion installed.
There are no other accounts in the native Mail app except my new Gmail one.  
However, when I send an email, the "Reply-to" address that the recipient sees is the email address of the previous owner.  
I cannot find a way to remove this email address, it is not in the settings of my sole Gmail account.  It seems to be registered somewhere in the account info of the Mac.  

A: Check the "me" card.  Open Address Book, go to the "Card" menu, and select "Go to my card".  Edit if required.  Restart Mail, and send yourself a test email.  Check the from address.
Also, I know you've already checked this, but please check again. In Mail.app, go to Preferences, Accounts, and make sure that the email address is set correctly.
