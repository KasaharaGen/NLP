Q: How to shrink a Windows XP VMWare Fusion virtual machine? Is it possible to shrink a VM Ware Fusion Virtual Machine, and if so how? Specifically a Windows XP guest/client?
I've found old references to procedures purported to make this possible, but they reference a VM Ware DiskTool that appears to no longer be available.

A: In VMWare Fusion 3. There are 2 parts
Prerequisites are the VM cannot have any snapshots and the virtual disk does not have a preallocated size. Making virtual disk sparse
Clean up Windows
I would then in Windows run the MS Disk Cleanup tool to remove files and then Disk Defragmentor to put all the space in one place.
VMWare tools includes a shrink disk command
Then power off the VM
