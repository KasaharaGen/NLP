Q: How to join an Active Directory domain in Lion? where do I begin in joining an OS X Lion workstation to an existing AD Domain (Server 2008 R2)?

A: Looks to me like it's under System Preferences > Users & Groups > Click on 'Login Options' > then click 'Join' button next to where it says "Network Account Server".
Then the dialog box that comes down allows you to enter the AD domain server there. Click Ok.


A: There are major problems with the Mac OS Active Directory plug-in that actually started with 10.6.8 and they were NOT fixed in 10.7.2.  I've found that the AD plug-in from Likewise Open to be a very good solution, and it's free.

A: I joined MAC OS X 10.8.3 to AD (windows 2008 R2 SP1) successfully. However faced system hang when accessing 'Security and Privacy' from 'System Preferences'. 
In logs saw lot of permission errors. Solved it by 'Repairing Disk Permissions' from Disk Utility.
