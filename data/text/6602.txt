Q: Problem with "Open With" menu I ran this command in Terminal, which supposedly clears all duplicate applications from the "Open Withâ€¦" menu and now many of my files are just showing up as blank images (.zip files, .dmg files, .rar, etc.) and they don't open with the correct application. I did log  out and log back in after doing this. Help!!
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain user

A: Logout and then Login.
It's common for this to happen. If the problem doesn't fix itself upon logging back in it's just a matter of Rebuilding the Launch Services.
Try it this way:

/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister
  -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user

Alternatively, you can use the commercial utility MacPilot:
