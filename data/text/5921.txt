Q: I can't access the Mac App Store, iTunes, or Software Update on Lion I updated from Snow Leopard 10.6.8 to Lion. The OS update process was all right.
I can access the Internet by Firefox, but Safari.
I think my network is all right.
So, I can access the internet from Lion, but I canâ€™t use the Mac App Store, the iTunes Store or update my system. 
How can I fix these problems?

A: Are you running an actual Mac or are you running a Hackintosh?
This is a known Hackintosh issue
