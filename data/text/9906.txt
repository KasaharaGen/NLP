Q: Preview crashes on Print command I have this crash on Preview and TextEdit happening every time I use the Print command. cmd+p = spinning ball... It's only on these two apps, as far as I know. Ie: Mail app prints fine. Both MS Office and Acrobat Reader print okay.
Printed installed: Canon MF4360-4390 using driver Canon MF4360-4390 UFRII LT (UK); version 2.0
Current OS: 10.7.2
On 10.6 it worked fine.
I already deleted the printer and installed it again but got the same result.
Thanks for any help.

A: My Preview on Lion was crashing on Print. The stack in the crash log shows:
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread

I tried upgrading to the most recent drivers from Canon's MX850 page. No luck.
I opened "Get Info" from the Finder, with Preview selected, and saw I had set it to "Open in 32-bit mode". I unchecked that box. Now Preview prints again.

A: Found Canon's response to this bug on 10.7:

I also found that they issued a new driver a few weeks ago, so everything is OK. Preview is rocking again!
