Q: Can I make the mouse hairpin in the terminal more visible? It often takes me a while to find the mouse crosshair when working with Terminal.app. Is there a way to make it more visible?

A: There's an app available to download called Mouse Locator which will put green markers around your cursor if you press a hotkey.  That might help you but I don't know if it's still a working program under current OS X releases.

A: I've started having this problem also, not sure if it started happening after i got a retina screen or upgraded to mavericks, or im just getting old. My suggestion is to try iTerm2 which have a bit more visible "hairpin".

A: If you mean the blinking cursor, then you need to go into the terminal preferences. Here's a picture to help you better understand
