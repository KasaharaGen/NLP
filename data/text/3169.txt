Q: How can right click in Finder without using the trackpad or a mouse? My goal is to select a file in Finder and get to the "open with" menu without having to leave the keyboard.

A: You can use Ctrl+F2 to move the focus to the menu bar and then use the arrows to go to the Open With menu item.

A: Not without 3rd party. Check out BetterTouchTool.

A: I second the Quicksilver answer in the superuser thread referred to above â€” If you're a keyboard person you have to have this (or similar apps like Launchbar or Alfred).
