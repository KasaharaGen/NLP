Q: Automatic network location in Lion I'm looking for a Lion compatible application similar to AirportLocation that will automatically change the Network Location based on my current location.
It's becoming a bigger and bigger pain to change it every day, manually. I have different settings for home and for work. I'll also be adding several new places in up coming weeks.
It's a shame that AirportLocation isn't compatible with Lion because it's exactly what I was after and more!
Edit: I've seen an application called Sidekick, but I'm preferably after a free application, bash script, whatever.

A: I forked MarcoPolo for the explicit purpose of getting it working right on Snow Leopard and Lion.  I use it on Lion everyday, everything should be working perfectly.

A: I don't have a Lion machine available right now to test this, but I've been digging ControlPlane 1.0.6 on Snow Leopard for a week now, works great on my work MBP.  Worth a look, LMK if it works on 10.7.
