Q: How can I keep a Java-based pop-up open even when its parent page is closed? I'd like to run the Java client for Runescape but want to quit Safari while the Java pop-up is open. How can I do this?
My idea was finding out the URL of the client and running it through the java terminal command, but I'm having huge difficulty location the URL. =/

A: I tried looking a the source, but the website developer has embedded the applet information inside a bunch of JavaScript.  Also, even if you had the jar(s), if the applet requires communication back to the server, it would be a real pain to get it running.

For future reference, if they hadn't gotten all creative with the applet code, you could have simply run this command line:
$ appletviewer http://world87.runescape.com/


What I recommend is to create a dedicated Fluid App for the website.  It's super easy, just point Fluid at the base URL, and it creates a dedicated application wrapped around the website.  The coolest thing is that you can then simply launch your game directly from Applications.
Fluid is 100% free, and I am not affiliated with them in any way.

A: Well, this won't answer the question but will solve your problem: use the downloadable version of Runespace.
Then, for the question itself: you couldn't do what you're asking for, since Safari is responsible for the Java plugin. The only way would be to download the applet code and use the command @OverZealous gave.

A: The runescape client is running as part of Safari so you can't quit Safari without killing the client. But you can close hide the main Safari window (e.g. with Cmd-H) at least which will keep Safari running and the client open as well.
