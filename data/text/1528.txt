Q: Installing a HP Color LaserJet 1600 on MacOS 10.6.4 I'm trying to install a HP Color LaserJet 1600 on MacOS 10.6.4 with little luck. The printer works fine from my Windows machines. HP doesn't support the MacOS for this printer by default so I followed the instructions from this forum post: http://macosx.com/forums/hardware-peripherals/302806-hp-lazer-1600-printer-driver-mac.html.
The post offers several solutions but I followed the instructions from whiskynwhisky and downloaded a Unix driver from here: http://www.mediafire.com/?nocydet5wml. The instructions included with the download were straightforward and I now have the driver installed and the printer in System Preferences. Unfortunately while jobs queue and dequeue they do not actually print. Are there other options to get this printer to work on my MacBook Air? Do I need to do something differently with the driver I already have installed?

A: HP has published a list of printers not supported on OS X Mountain Lion on their web site:

Products not supported
The following products are not supported in Mac OS X including the Mountain Lion operating system

A: There is a app that claims to be able to print to legacy printers.
I am unable to confirm that since I do not have such a printer.

handyPrintâ„¢ v3.1 is a 64bit (core 2 duo or better) Mac OSX application
  that allow you to print from your iPods, iPads and iPhones on legacy
  printers that do not support the AirPrint protocol.
