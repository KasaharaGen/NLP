Q: Is there an app that will make my (jailbroken) iPhone vibrate when a call is answered? I have an jailbroken iPhone and I want it to make a little vibration when the other participant answer the call so I don't have to hold it near to my ear while the phone is dialing.
I found this feature in MCleaner app from Cydia but it costs too much and have a lot of other features that I don't need. Is there a better way to do that?

A: As someone who is involved in some iPhone developing, I can tell you that you can’t do that with the official SDK, so unless you find another Jailbroken app, there’s no “official” way to do it. 

A: Get Phone Buzzer from Cydia, it works brilliantly, and its free.

A: Hey make sure in your settings that you have a vibration selected.... I thought I had the same issue until I realized that a type of vibration wasn't selected.
