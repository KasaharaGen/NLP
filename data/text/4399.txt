Q: Is there a way to refresh symbolichotkeys.plist without logging out? There is an extremely annoying bug in OS X with a non-Apple mouse where every time I reboot I have to go into ~/Library/Preferences and delete com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist, logout, then reset my buttons for Expose and Spaces.
This bug has been around for years now, and Apple refuses to fix it so I'm trying to figure out a way to make starting up a less painful experience.  I think it would be bearable if I could just scrap symbolichotkeys and refresh without having to logout.  Is there a command or AppleScript that could accomplish this?

A: You can restart the SystemUIServer by killing the process in Activity Monitor. It will auto restart. I think that should give you the desired effect without a reboot/logout.
