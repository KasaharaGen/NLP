Q: Move windows around a desktop -- and to different desktops -- using only the keyboard? Here's what I'm trying to accomplish using only a keyboard:


*

*Move a window to different areas/corners of a desktop

*Move a window to different desktops

*Set/unset a window as shown/sticky on all desktops
Yes, I know #3 could solve #2 by stickying a window, pressing ctrl+âŒ˜+&leftarrow;/&rightarrow;, then unstickying it, which would be acceptable, but i'm hoping for something a little more elegant :) 

NB, if 1..3 can be solved in AppleScript, that would be great because Spark has been invaluable to tie an AppleScript to a global keyboard shortcut. However I don't think AppleScript can do this type of window location manipulation and a native Cocoa app may be required.

I really want to return to my keyboard-only nirvana but in my adoptive platform and shed Ubuntu Desktop.

A: There are many, many different sharewares out there that let you move windows around using shortcuts. Just look for window manager in the Mac App Store. I would recommend BetterTouchTool. It's a freeware that let's you customize just about anything. For example here is the shortcuts I have created for myself :

A: I'm still on Mountain Lion, so can't vouch for Mavericks. However...
ShiftIt is also worth a mention.  Keyboard only, but works great for me for corners, fullscreen and next screen functionality.
For configurable transparency and stickiness I use Afloat (source on GitHub)

A: Moom is pretty awesome and will allow you to do #1 and #2.

A: If you hold down the green fullscreen button, it gives you the option to split/share the screen with a second window
