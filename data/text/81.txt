How can I change the colors of calendars on iOS5 

I have an iPhone 4 that syncs with iCal through Google. However, the colors for the calendars are different on the iPhone than on iCal. Is there any way to set the colors for the calendars on the iPhone so that they are the same as the colors I have selected in iCal?

A: There's no official way to achieve this, however you can try a trick involving deactivating / reactivating calendars in a certain order until they match the colour you want.

A: Assuming you have your preferred colors set in iCal, try this on your next sync:
BE SURE YOU SYNC ANY CALENDAR INFO YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDED VIA THE PHONE BEFORE DOING THIS OVERWRITE


*

*In iTunes, select your iPhone in "Devices" (same as normal sync)

*At the top of the sync window, click on "Info"

*Scroll down to the Advanced heading

*Under "Replace information on this iPhone", check the "Calendars" box

*Sync at will


This should override all of the calendar settings on your iPhone, and replace them with the settings from iCal.
