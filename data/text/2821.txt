Q: How can I automatically download trailers in iTunes? Apple gets the latest trailers. Is there any way I can automate iTunes to download the newest trailers? Similar to how it automatically downloads the latest podcasts?

A: Unfortunately, Apple is not using itunes-aware tags in its RSS feed for the latest movie trailers.

The encounter sets into motion a series of events that causes all hell to break loose. A horror thriller that could only come from the imagination of Smith, RED STATE stars Tarantino and Rodriguez favorite Michael Parks ("From Dusk Till Dawn", "Kill Bill Vols. 1 & 2"), Oscar Nominee for Best Actress Melissa Leo ("The Fighter," "Frozen River") and John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kyle Gallner and Nicholas Braun.<br /><b>Directed by:</b> Kevin Smith<br /><b>Starring:</b> Michael Angarano, Kerry Bish&#x00E9;, Nicholas Braun, Kyle Gallner, John Goodman, Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Root</span></td>

So, when you try to subscribe to feed://trailers.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss, iTunes claims the content is text-only or missing.
However, if you are using Apple Mail, you can add this feed to Apple Mail and it handles it quite nicely. It doesn't download the movies automatically but at least you see when there are new ones.
