Q: How do I fix this Smart Folder problem? It keeps switching off of "This Mac" I created a Smart Folder in the finder called "TV" which searches for files of type movie created in the last 7 days. When I created the search in the first place, I clicked on "Search This Mac" to find all files anywhere. But now, even when I have new files that I've downloaded nothing will show up in the folder. When I click on Search criteria on the top it will say
Search: This Mac   TV 
and TV will be selected. But, remember, I saved it as "This Mac" 
Why won't it stick to "This Mac"? Why does it keep going to "TV" which doesn't make sense anyway, if there's nothing in a folder, then it can't find files in that folder of the type that it's supposed to be searching for...

A: Here's the steps I used to do what you're looking for which seem to be working the way you want.  
Open Finder and click File > New Smart Folder - or press ⌥⌘N
Then setup as I have in the screenshot below and click 'Save' near the top right.  

Then, when the little drop-down menu appears for you to save, select the options like I have below.  

Now, you'll get a window left behind like this.  

Now, close your new Smart Folder.  Then in Finder, open a normal finder window with either File > New Finder Window or ⌘N 
Your 'TV' Smart Folder will be listed under the 'Search For' section on the bottom-left if you expand it out, like so  


A: Does it ask you to save when you click on "This Mac" and then switch away to, say, another search? I just tried it out, it should ask you to save.
Are you on 10.5 or 10.6?
Cheers.
