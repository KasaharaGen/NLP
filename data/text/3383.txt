Q: How can I use Nike+ with roller skates? Is it possible to use Nike+ with rollerblade skates? How?

A: Nike+ is a step counter, so it's measuring steps. With rollerblades you're not stepping usually.
You can try to calibrate your device with your moves of your rollerblades, but I don't think it will measure it correctly.
