Q: How Can I Use AirPlay Globally for System Sound? Is it possible (and how) to have all the system sound played on AirPlay? Or at least for some specific (random) application (e.g. Songbird)?

A: What you want is AirFoil by Rogue Amoeba. Plays any audio from your system via AirPlay.

A: If you have a newer Mac with Mountain Lion you can also use it's built in AirPlay functionality.
Go to System Preferences->Sound and select Apple TV from the Output tab. This will play all system sound from your Mac.

A: An easy way to do this in Mountain Lion is to hold down the option key and click on the speaker icon in the menu bar. You then get a list of possible outputs, and will be able to send all audio to your Apple TV or other AirPlay device by selecting it.
