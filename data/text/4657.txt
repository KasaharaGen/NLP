Q: Angle Bracket Characters in Apple TV2 On Screen Keyboard I've speen a while trying to figure this out to no avail.  On 4.3.1 Apple TV2's Onscreen Keyboard, I can't find some characters, in particular angle brackets (< and >).  I know some characters can be accessed by holding select over the 'master' character, but none of them seem to have < and > in 4.3.  They were present in 4.2 firmware version keyboard, which was of a different design.  Thanks in advance!

A: There never was a solution I found; but by using an iOS device (ipod Touch, iphone, ipad) and the Remote app, a full ability to type into boxes was enabled and allowed me to work around this problem.
