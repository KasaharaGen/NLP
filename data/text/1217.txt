Q: Is this nice extension of Mac OS 9 still available on OS X? There was an extension on Mac OS 9 system that I could not live without : This extension offered the following feature : 
When a "Choose a file / folder" dialog box appeared, you were able to click on a "visible" opened window to make the selection box "jump" to that particular place in the tree structure of the disk (on the network).
Is there something like this on OS X ?

A: Not exactly the same but if you drag any file or folder to the dialog panel then it will jump to the location of the dropped item

A: You are looking for Default Folder X.
