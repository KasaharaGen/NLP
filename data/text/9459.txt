Q: Model number of iPhone 4S Officially Unlocked Can someone please tell me the model number (something like MC920LL) of their Officially unlocked iPhone 4S 16GB White, that Apple started selling since Nov 11.
There are various other contract-free phones available but they are not truly unlocked since there is a risk of being locked in the future maybe.
So if anyone has bought the OFFICIALLY unlocked white or black iPhone 4S from apple directly, can you PLEASE share the model number?
Many thanks!

A: The model number doesn't have anything to do with whether the phone is locked or not. The model number is tied to the unit's hardware components. All current black and white iPhone 4S' have the model number: A1387 
The only time you'll see a different model number during the same production line is when Apple makes a hardware change (such as the iPhone 4 GSM and CDMA versions, or the 3GS "old" and "new" bootroms).
More details found over at Apple.
