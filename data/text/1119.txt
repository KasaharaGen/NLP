Q: How can I change multiple line code indentation in Textmate? When I use textmate, I select multiple lines and I press TAB, I would like to change the indentation of my code, rather than deleting it.
Is there a way to change this functionality?

A: Using Alt + Tab also works.

A: Not sure about changing the tab but you can use
CMD + } 
to indent multiple lines of code at the same time.
CMD + {
pushes it to the right.

A: I like to hold down alt and then use the mouse to select a column of text. Then I hit tab to indent the lines.
