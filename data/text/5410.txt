Is there a way to export chat history in Skype 5.2.x for OS X? 

I'm currently running 5.2.x on OS X 10.6.8 and I need to some deep searching of the past history in a conversation with a colleague. Skype tells me the term I'm looking for is in the long-running chat we've had, but good luck getting it to show you the specific chat entry in time without manually scrolling backwards through months and months of back-and-forth.
I'd like to export the conversation as some format I can access programmatically (HTML, XML, etc.). The HTML export options that used to be present in Skype for OS X seem to have disappeared as of the 5.0 release.

A: try the SQLite export method @ http://billxinli.com/2011/07/28/export-skype-chat-history-and-other-meta-data/ =)
