Q: Push notifications only work every now and then My iPods push notifications only work every now and then and I'm always on the same router. All my notification settings are turned on but like I said they only work occasionally. Does anyone know how to fix this so they work everyday all the time?

A: Is your iDevice jailbroken?
If it is you could potentially use Push Doctor to fix the push problems you're having.

A: Which notifications are you not getting all the time. I know that there are some applications that aren't written properly or are written in a way that you wouldn't expect that cause you not to get a notification when you think you will. For instance, Facebook. If you're on facebook on your computer and you get a notification it doesn't get pushed to your phone right away, it'll wait a bit to see if you're actually going to check it another way first before sending it to the phone.

A: You should change your DNS to 8.8.8.8.
