Q: What readers annotate PDFs better than the Preview app? I usually spend around 3 or 4 hours a day working with and annotating PDFs. I've always used Preview, but there's a few things that bother me about it. Mainly the large icons used when you place notes, which can get in the way in tightly formatted documents. 
Is there an alterate PDF reader that is any better for annotating documents?

A: PDF Expert is hands down the best pdf editor made.  Better than Acrobat.

A: PDF Studio Viewer is a free PDF Reader for macOS that can annotate PDF documents with text and graphical comments including text highlights and markup, shape annotations, text box, typewriter, callout, etc. It can also fill interactive forms.
All annotations are compliant with PDF specs and Adobe products and can be viewed by other readers on all platforms.

A: Skim is a pdf reader specialy designed to annotate pdf.
Skim is a PDF reader and note-taker for OS X. It is designed to help you read and annotate scientific papers in PDF, but is also great for viewing any PDF file.
Stop printing and start skimming.

A: While not meant primarily for your use case, I found Mendeley Desktop to be quite adept at highlighting and annotating.

A: There are plenty of good PDF readers on Mac, including:
Formulate Pro, http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19911/formulatepro
PDFPen and PDFPen Pro (a little bit expensive but really good software)
PDF Checkpoint that I like very much which allows you to automate your workflow.
You should try their free version to see which one suits your needs ;)

A: I too can share my best PDF experience with PDF Expert by readdle.Very advanced PDF editor/viewer,and also in some very large files where Preview would crash,it didn't.Absolutely worth the money.

A: I agree with the previous answer ... so far I think skim is the best.
Yet, I had some issues that it would not display the annotations on every platform.
I like to use Adobe Illustrator for annotating. Yet, you will need a lot of processing power + it's not really cheap (if you just want to use it for annotating, don't bother buying it).

A: https://getpolarized.io/ is another mediocre, Electron (and web) solution. It is also always-online and has a free plan with 1 GB of storage. It has some integration with Anki.

A: To be honest if you are spending that amount of time a day with PDFs its worth buying Acrobat Pro. Its not cheap but nothing else comes close in terms of its feature set. I have found version 10 to be really stable too.
