Q: How to embed url in new Mail from Mac OS Lion I don't know how this feature is called. Here on stack exchange you can take some text and mark it as a url. The url is embedded below. Example:
Google
Is there an equivalent in Mac OS Lions Mail Client, too? It looks better if you don't see the cluttering url. I searched the menu, but I couldn't find what I am looking for. I hope you got me. :)

A: Yes, this is possible.
First write the text for the link - then right click on the text, and select "Link->Add Link" - enter the URL, and click "OK" - and you have what you want.




A: Highlight the text that you want to link and press command+K (⌘+K or +K).
Then enter the URL into the popup.

A: *
