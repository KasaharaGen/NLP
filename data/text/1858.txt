Q: Multiple apps in one icon for the iPad My husband's iPhone has the multi app icon and wanted to get the same on my new iPad.  
Is it possible to get it on the iPad?

A: I think you are talking about iOS folder. If so, touch and hold one icon till icons begin dithering. Then drag and drop one icon on an other icon which of two you want to folder together. Your ipad will suggest you a folder name. You may change or assume that. Then push the home button.
