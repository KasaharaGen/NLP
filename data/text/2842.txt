Q: It is possible to use iPhone as BT headset for the computer? I would like to use my iPhone as an BT headset, is it possible to pair it with the computer and to have it used for computer calls?

A: Natively no, the iPhone is limited to what is parable to it, and the functions once it is paired.. With a jailbroken iPhone there may be some third party software out there.
