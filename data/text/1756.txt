Q: Why can't I delete movies from my iPhone 4, either from the phone or through iTunes?  I was on vacation and took some videos, and now the iPhone 4 memory is near full.  So I tried to delete other experimental movies I made using Handbrake, so that I can take more video or photos, but if I plug the iPhone 4 into my Notebook computer, I can seem to delete it on iTunes?
Maybe because the computer I sync with the iPhone 4 is at home (a desktop), but not with me on vacation.
I can't delete it on iTunes, can't delete it on iPhone itself.  I am stuck during the vacation, or is there a way to handle it?

A: While not a SuperUser-compatible answer, since the computer interface is missing, I just did the following:


*

*Open the iPod app

*Go to Videos 

*Swipe over a video from right to left

*Press Delete

*Confirm

*Done!


No computer needed. Also works for music

A: I'm not aware of anyway to delete music/video directly from the phone, without connecting back to the original iTunes and telling it to remove the file. If you're jailbroken you could SSH/SFTP into the phone and try removing the file from the phone but I'm not sure what affect that would have on the iPod's index of files.
I think you might be stuck until you can get back to the original system.
