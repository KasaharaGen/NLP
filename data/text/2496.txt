Q: Is it possible to preserve Light Table (or Album) ordering when exporting from Aperture? I'd like to export my Light Table to disk using a custom counter that preserves the ordering of the Light Table. Alternatively, I'd like to do the same for an Album.
Thoughts?

A: This always works for me as is in Aperture (v 3.1.2).
Are you pressing v to get to the browser view for the specific album or light table before exporting. You can drag things into manual order or specify any other sort like Date, Rating or other sorting. At that point when you export as versions, the counter takes the pictures in the order shown.
Here a pair of clips of Light Tables and the control for ordering.
