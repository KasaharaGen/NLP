Q: Keyboard shortcut for launching Apps in Dock In Windows 7, Win
 + 1, 2, 3 ... 9 launches the first, second etc App in task bar.
Is there a similar keyboard shortcut in OS X in order to launch Apps that are in the Dock?

A: I don't know the exact solution but you can use control+fn+F3 after that you can navigate through Dock with keyboard arrow keys (→ or ←) and press enter on your desire app.

A: Just downloaded a 99 cent app from the mac app store called "Snap" that fixes this. Now I hit command-1 and the first app in my dock launches. Awesome!

A: As @Am1rr3zA said, you can use the default Control + fn + F3. You can then press Enter or Space to launch an app.
You can change the key binding in the Keyboard shortcuts menu in the Settings application.


A: This is a neat windows feature to want in the Dock, but if you like keyboard shortcuts, why not get a customizable application, like Quicksilver that lets you do a lot via the keyboard. Its not going to be easy / quick if you have a lot of Apps in your dock to remember a meaning less position number of a icon in a dock, when you could just ask for what you want directly.  Something like Quicksilver will not only help you open stuff in the dock faster it will let you open stuff not in the dock at extreme speeds.
For example, after getting Quicksilver's attention via a configurable key command, I type "F" and hit enter to open Firefox on my setup.  

A: Create a Hammerspoon script to assign shortcut keys. For example, this script assigns Option+C to Calendar and Option+M to Mail.
shortcuts = {
    {"C", "Calendar"},
    {"M", "Mail"},
}

for i,shortcut in ipairs(shortcuts) do
    hs.hotkey.bind({"alt"}, shortcut[1], function()
        hs.application.launchOrFocus(shortcut[2])
    end)
end
