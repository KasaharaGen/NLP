Q: Spotify output to AirPlay speakers on iPad I don't see the AirPlay speaker selection gadget on the Spotify IOS client.

*Is AirPlay support something the App developer must provide explicitly?

*Is there a way to force the default audio output from an IOS device to an AirPlay speaker at the system level?


A: D'oh! The AirPlay icon is available in the Spotify client. It is on the Info page rather than the top page.  That's where volume control is, too.
