Q: Why does dragging a space in Spaces lag awfully? All of a sudden, dragging a space in spaces to switch it for another space lags and takes for ever.  
Why? any solutions? It didn't happen before. 
There are not many apps open, memory's fine, dragging windows in Spaces works great, switching into and out of spaces works fast too.  
See: video example.
PS: Embedding videos here would be nice wouldn't it?

A: Mine is slow too. Note that it works with the mouse, not the graphic, so you can click, drag, release, and move out of Spaces, and the effect will have worked, even if the graphics didn't finish yet.
Also, dragging an empty space is, for me, much faster, so if I want to swap an active work space with an empty one, it is better to drag the empty to the active than the active to the empty.

A: I reinstalled the OS and the problem went away.
I'll mark this answer as correct until someone comes with a better one.
