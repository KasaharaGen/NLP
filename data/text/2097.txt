Q: Third Party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI Cables curious if anyone has any experience with any third party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI cables? I noticed the cables on ebay selling for around $16. Compared to the official cables that run for around $35 seems like a bargin. Wasn't sure if the quality is the same or if anyone has any experience with buying them. Thanks!

A: The cables from Monoprice.com have recently changed so they're not shaped as nicely as before, but the quality is still excellent for the price. 6ft cable for $10 shipped.

The picture isn't faithful to what you'll receive as the Mini Display Port male plug is now a bit bulkier. Still works flawlessly though.

A: Most third-party cables will work perfectly.  In particular, any cables which are digital should perform exactly as their more expensive counterparts.  I've personally used a couple of third party cables which worked without issue.
I bought a Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable when the MacBook Pro 13" Unibody first came out from www.circuitassembly.com and it's great quality and was cheap too

A: A cheap knockoff Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter in I bought on eBay for $7 worked pretty well, but caused a strange problem on my rMBP. Occasionally, when using it, my Wi-Fi would cut out, and switching to an Apple adapter fixed the issue.
I tested this six ways to Sunday, and the cheap adapter was definitely the consistent factor. It's a weird issue, but apparently I'm not the only one.

A: We got several mini-display port to DVI, VGA and HDMI cables from http://www.meritline.com/ and they work great.  In particular, they have a mini-displayport to hdmi, dvi and displayport (all in one) dongle.
