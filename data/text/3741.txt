Q: How can I disable Bluetooth A2DP profiles on the iPhone 4? Simple question: I'd like to disable the A2DP profile for either (a) specific devices paired with the iPhone or (b) the profile entirely from the phone. How can I disabled the A2DP profiles? There used to be a program called Bluetooth Profile Selector for jailbroken iPhones. However, it stopped working after 4.3.1.
Here's the detailed scenario on why:
I have a stereo in my car that accepts a USB connector. This is how my iPhone is connected and plays music through. This way the audio quality is pristine, I can see the track information and control my iPhone from the headunit, and it charges my iPhone.
The headunit also pairs via Bluetooth for hands-free calling. However, because the iPhone supports A2DP, this is how it pairs to the headunit. I can do hands-free calling just fine, however it screws up the audio coming from the dock connector. Basically, the iPhone will begin playing music via the dock connector until it auto-pairs with the headunit. At this point, the iPhone automatically changes the output method to the Bluetooth connection. Manually changing this back over to the dock connector every single time is not something I wish to deal with.

A: The app you are referring to has a manual process you can try, but it is not for the faint of heart: http://blog.ramondeklein.nl/?p=257

Howto disable A2DP on the iPhone
The interesting directory is
  /var/mobile/Library/Preferences, where
  the iPhone stores the BlueTooth
  settings. These settings are stored in
  the PLIST format, so you need a PLIST
  editor (Mac or PC) or you need to
  convert them by hand. Transfer the
  com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist
  to your computer or you can use iFile
  to edit the file on your iPhone
  directly.
Open the
  com.apple.MobileBluetooth.services.plist
  in your PLIST editor and make sure you
  edit the A2DPService section and store
  the devices you don’t want to use A2DP
  in the UnauthorizeList (without the
  letter “d”). This dictionary will
  probably not exist yet, so you need to
  add it by hand. You need to know the
  MAC address, but it is probably listed
  already in this file.
<key>A2DPService</key>
<dict>
  <key>State</key>
  <true/>
  <key>UnauthorizeList</key>
  <dict>
    <key>00:10:60:D0:91:D0</key>        <!-- This is the MAC address -->
    <date>2009-08-08T01:00:00Z</date>   <!-- Timestamp -->
  </dict>
</dict>

Transfer the PLIST file back to your iPhone and reboot the device. Once it gets back on,  then the A2DP service should be disabled.


A: Do you not just need to do this;


*

*Connect via bluettooth

*Go to the iPod app

*Click on the hidden button bottom right that only appears when you are connected to Bluetooth.

*Select the output device that isn't your handsfree destination, it seems to remember this choice on my setup(?)


That worked for me when I had the same problem

A: A new package was developed to disable A2DP and I can confirm it works.

A: Another answer mentioning the Bluetooth service manager doesn't work in all cases. Specifically, it only disables A2DP and it doesn't disable it per device.
I use a parrot car kit and would rather use my blackberry Bluetooth dongle I have in the car, unfortunately that little button that appears doesn't remember settings for me, kind of a pain to switch it while driving, it seems to change back to the parrot after a call also.
