Q: MacBook Pro randomly restarting I'm new to daily Mac use, but I think I have my settings correct. My laptop is kept plugged in at work - never runs on battery. In my Energy Saver system prefs, I have Computer Sleep and Display Sleep set to Never on both Power Adapter and Battery, all options (hard disk sleep, wake for network access, reduce brightness, start up after power failure) are unchecked. There is nothing set up in the Schedule area to turn on or off at specific times. 
At least twice a week, though, when I go to lunch (which is never at the same time) if I'm gone for more than an hour or so, when I come back the computer has restarted itself. Not gone to sleep, or shut down, but completely restarted.
Is there a system log somewhere I could look at that would show me what was happening at the times the computer restarted? Or is there some other setting I'm missing that's making this happen? Although I try to remember to save all my work before I leave just in case, every so often I forget, and I'm getting sick of losing work (or even just losing system state and having to restart all my programs, reopen all my files, etc.)
UPDATE
I don't know if anyone is still following this; I'll post as a new question if I don't hear back in a few days. It's been restarting fairly regularly the past few weeks; I just haven't had time to check the console and figure things out. Today I know to within a 20-minute period when the restart happened, so I'm posting the console messages from that period.

A: I got an answer from someone at the Apple forums... it was the Log Out After... setting in the System Prefs -> Security -> General.

A: You can try to find a clue in the system log.
sudo less /var/log/system.log


A: There is an EFI Firmware update that supposedly resolves this issue on some Macbook models. Click the Apple logo on the top left of your screen and scroll down to Software Update. If there is a firmware update for your Macbook, it will appear here. Download the update and follow the instructions - this should resolve the problem.

A: Sorry to say, whenever any Mac laptop has done this—and they have, or used to, when I owned Powerbook G4's … it meant impending logic board (motherboard) failure.

A: If the Mac is under Applecare, I would call them and give them a chance to fix it.
If it's not under Applecare, bring it to the Apple store.  You can book a Genius appointment at the Apple web site and they'll help you out.  It may be related to the "running hot" issue and they may have an advisory out to resolve your issue.
I've had great success in dealing with the Genius people at the store and there's no downside to giving them a shot at it.
