Q: How to stop flood of Non-Local IPv6 events in my Console (system.log)? For some reason, my Console is filling up with <8/15/11 6:47:12.000 PM kernel: IPv6 Non-Local address> messages. A quick Google doesn't tell me much and there's nothing on some of the usual boards. Any hints? I'm on a MacBook Pro running Lion.

A: Issue resolved by turning off GlimmerBlocker.
