Q: Combining users on OSX 10.6.8 I just bought a new mac and when migrating my old to my new mac, I accidentally put it in a different user. Is there a way, I can combine both users?

A: There's no way to combine user accounts. If one of the accounts is empty the best option is to delete it. Otherwise, move everything you want from one account's home folder to another and then get rid of the old one.
