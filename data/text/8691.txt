Q: Is there a way to use punctuation in Siri dictation? Is there a way to use punctuation in Siri dictation? For instance, if I tell Siri to text someone "want to meet for dinner?" - it won't track inflection, right? How can I add the question mark via voice?

To get Siri to use punctuation, you only need to speak the punctuation during the composition of your message. For example:

Hi comma how are you question mark did you see the game last night
  exclamation point question mark.

Speaking that exact line to Siri would equate to the following message:

Hi, how are you? Did you see the game last night!?


A: CrushApps has a comprehensive list of commands and punctuation that Siri understands.
Here's a short summary as requested by Daniel. These are the ones I find most useful day to day.


*

*"all caps on ... all caps off": "I am so all caps on hungry all caps off I could eat a horse" -> I am so HUNGRY I could eat a horse

*"exclamation point": "You're the man exclamation point" -> You're the man!

*"question mark": "What was that question mark" -> What was that?

*"smiley" or "smiley face" or "smile face": "smiley face" -> :-)

*"winky" or "winky face" or "wink face": "wink face" -> ;-)
But there are many more that include a surprising amount of edge cases. It's possible to dictate the following sentence: "The number, "pi", is ... 3.14 (approximately)."
