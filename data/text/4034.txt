A: You can use AptBackup or PkgBackup to backup your Cydia downloads before restoring, then reinstall after the restore and run again to reinstall all the Cydia stuff that you had.

A: You can back up and restore your Cydia package selections as follows: 
Backup installed package list on current machine
dpkg --get-selections > selections.txt

Move selections.txt to the new machine. 
Set package list on new machine and install packages. 
dpkg --set-selections < selections.txt
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
