Q: What are some tactile iPad apps to show to a graphic designer? I'm looking for apps that have faux materials in them like leather, wood, paper, etc. (Apple stresses "tactile" apps when guiding developers.) I'm trying to guide a graphic designer. What are some apps that I can show that get the point across? 

A: Your question didn't specify free apps so here are a few paid apps:


*

*Manage - currently $2.99 in AUD. Has a faux leather look.

*Corkulous - currently $4.99 in AUD. Simulates a corkboard complete with sticky-taped labels and sticky notes.

*Ruler 2 - currently $0.99 in AUD. Looks like a wooden ruler.

*ABC News - this one is free. It's not tactile, but the lead stories are presented wrapped around a globe.


There is a free app called Stylapps that is a showcase for stylish apps, though not specifically for apps that look like tactile materials.
