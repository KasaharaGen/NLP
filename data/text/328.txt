Q: Tools for making Finder easier to use? I need the following tools for Finder.


*

*Launch a Terminal from Finder.

*Copy a path information from Finder. 

*Make a new file from Finder. (not a new directory)


Any hints?

A: FilePathCM. FilePathCM is a contextual menu and menu bar item for copying the:


*

*POSIX path 

*Server afp URL 

*Abbreviated (Tilde) POSIX path 

*POSIX path for Terminal.app 

*HFS path 

*Full name

*Display name 

*Extension 

*Windows style path 


of Finder items (files, folders, volumes) to the clipboard.
To create a new file, see this link: http://www.webmonkey.com/2007/03/how_to_create_new_files_in_apple_s_finder/
To launch a terminal, I like answer from neoneye but I also use DTerm.

A: I have no idea how to create a new file from within the Finder, however..

cdto
Opens Terminal and cd's to the current Finder dir.
cdff
cdff allows you to open the current Terminal dir in the finder.

A: I would suggest you to use Path Finder
It is not a free application but you have 30 days to try it out. You can see a screencast here.
It enables you to do the following from your requisites:


*

*Launch a Terminal from Finder.

*Copy a path information from Finder. (I don't know what you mean with this but it sure does the job).

*Make a new file from Finder. (not a new directory)
and any more...
