Q: How to buy multiple Lion licenses from the Mac App Store? I need to install Mac OS X 10.7 Lion on about 10 company workstations.
If those were my personal computers, I could simply buy one license and then log into the Mac App Store on each workstation to download the installer.
But since according to the EULA I need to purchase 10 licenses, I wonder how to do that using a single Mac App Store account (Apple ID)? Is it at all possible to buy multiple licenses for an app on the Mac App Store?

A: App Store Volume Purchasing for Business

A: Apple Software Volume Licensing lets you purchase bundles of 20+ licenses for Apple software, including Lion. The licenses can be bought via the Apple Store for Business and redeemed in the Mac App Store.
If you need to purchase less than 20 commercial licenses, it seems you cannot do so using a single Apple ID. Have fun creating an Apple ID for each license you want to buy..

A: Inside of the Mac App Store, no. Just purchasing the licenses at Apple's Online Store for Business, yes:
