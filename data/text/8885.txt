Q: Upgraded iPad 2 to iOS 5 : no device summary pane I upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 5.
I don't want to sync it through the cloud : I just want to sync it as usual, with iTunes through my USB connector.
But I have a problem : as soon as I upgradedto iOS 5, when my iPad is connected to my Mac, iTunes is not displaying the device summary pane.
I have SnowLeopard 10.6.8, iTunes 10.5.
Here is a screenshot of what I get :

As you can see, the iPad is seen by iTunes, but no device summary pane is displayed.
Any idea how I can solve this problem ?

A: Well I found a solution to my problem : I connected my iPad to another Mac, to check if I would face the same problem. It worked fine on the other machine.
Then, I tried to connect it again to my own Mac and to my great surprise, it was working perfectly !
So basically, connecting my iPad to another Mac solved the problem !
