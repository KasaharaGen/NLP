Q: Iphone 4 is acting glitchy.Should I update it? I've had my IPhone 4 since October 30th. Yesterday, it started acting funny.  I can't receive text messages and when I do receive calls they go straight to  voicemail. I'll get the voice mail several hours later. I can send texts AND make calls. I have reset everything on my phone and nothing has worked. I haven't updated anything on my  phone because it is jail broken and I do not want to lose my games. Is it possible that because I have not updated it's acting up? I know it isn't my account. Could there be anything else wrong with it?

A: I don't think having a slight outdated OS or Jailbroken device would cause those glitches to occur.  On my iPhone 4 it once acted funny in a different way by not responding to my finger taps correctly.  Try this, it helped me:


*

*Hold the sleep/wake button on top and the home button at the same time.  When the "slide to power off" slider appears keep holding the two buttons.

*When it appears to be off keep holding the two buttons still.

*Finally, when the boot apple logo appears you can release the two buttons.


This isn't a jailbreak technique that turns the phone into DFU or Recovery Mode.  It's like a soft reboot that clears any lingering data on its RAM that might be causing your problems.

A: Back when I had a 3G I had this exact problem. it was related to tethering being enabled via the http://help.benm.at/ hack.
Reverted and things started working fine.
