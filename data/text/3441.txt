Q: How can I get the mic sound feedback in my headphone? I bought a noise canceling headphone yesterday and it works perfectly. The only problem I have is that when I myself talk, I cannot hear my voice correctly. I'm wondered if it is possible to enable the microphone sound feedback in the audio output while the headphone is connected? I have a MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.6 installed.

A: You can use GarageBand as well (see this answer) simply create a new project with voice and set monitor to on. You don't need to record to hear your voice.


A: I use Audacity for recording new sounds, besides being free, it gives you the option for hardware or software Playthrough.


A: LineIn from Rogue Amoeba lets you route any sound input to any output. Freeware.
PS: It has been updated and now works without a delay in the audio play thru!.
