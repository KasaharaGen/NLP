Q: How to install g++ or c++ without paying for xcode? I need to install node.js on my new Mac and it requires having c++ or g++ compiler installed.
How do I get one without paying for xcode?

A: Just to be complete - Xcode 4.1.1 is free on the App Store but it requires Lion which implies a recent hardware purchase or paying for the upgrade.

A: OSX GCC Installer

Downloading and installing the massive Xcode installer is a huge hassle if you just want GCC and related tools.
The osx-gcc-installer allows you to install the essential compilers from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.

First mentioned here by Dancek

A: You could get gcc for MacOSX from Apples Open Source site: http://opensource.apple.com/release/developer-tools-40/
It doesn't come with any instructions though.
(I think gcc is suitable, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

A: The Mac comes with software DVDs--one of those has Xcode. You can install it from there.

A: You can still download Xcode 3.x for free with a free developer account. Xcode 3 comes with the GCC 4.2, LLVM-GCC 1.5 and LLVM 1.5 so everything you need to compile C++, C and ObjC code.
(Remark: LLVM 1.5 can't compile C++ code, so you have to switch back to LLVM-GCC or GCC for this.)

A: XCode does NOT come with the latest GCC and G++ (it comes with 4.2), so you still need to do your own install if you want the latest features. Macports and GNU do NOT provide sufficient instructions. So, it remains a mystery. 
You can download XCode or find it on your install CD. That will give you you the older GCC/G++. Once you have that, you can download the latest GCC.

BUT, how do you install??
All I know is..


*

*Unzip the folder. It should be named    gcc-4.6.3  OR  gcc-4.7.3   etc.

*Create a new folder ADJACENT to the gcc-4.6.3 folder, called     buidgcc
(the   buildgcc   folder and   gcc-4.6.3   folder  live in the same place. Possibly in the folder     Developer/usr    )

*Open a terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal)

*Navigate to the   buildgcc     folder that you created
Terminal Commmands
cd ..      brings you UP 1 level(note space between  cd  and  ..  )
ls         tells you what files & folders are in the folder you're in
cd/foldername         lets you navigate into a folder

*If you're in the    buildgcc    folder, type:
 ../gcc-4.6.3/configure
WAIT.   Then type:
  make
WAIT a very long time. 
Sorry. Here is where I'm stuck.
