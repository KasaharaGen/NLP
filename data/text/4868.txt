Q: Where is the forward delete button in iPhone’s keyboard? Where is the left-to-right delete button in iPhone’s keyboard? We have backspace but where is Delete?

A: There is no "forward delete" key (as it's often called) on the iPhone. The same is true on the Mac. 
On the Mac you can hold down the Fn (Function) key and press the Delete key to get forward deletion, but there's nothing on the iPhone.
