Q: How do you reset screen zoom to zero? How do you reset screen zoom to zero?
I mean the one you do with control-mouse wheel, I know you can reset it with the wheel again until it gets to 1:1 but it would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut to make it 1:1
Is there?

A: When zoom is enabled in accessibility preferences, command option - is the default shortcut for zooming out, it's not instant, but it's a pretty fast method.

A: I'd say hold ⌥+⌘+–. In fact, holding ⌥+⌘+8 will disable it, but once you press it again, it comes back to the old level, therefore ⌥+⌘+– seems the best solution.
