Q: iPhone Contact List Default Country Wrong My wife's default country for creating contacts is the Netherlands.  The only solution I've found online is to go to:
Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format

That doesn't seem to do anything.  It's already set to the United States.  So I went and switched the country to see if it would do anything.  Nothing.
Anyone know another way I can set the default country? 

A: This works perfectly if you have Verizon. My default was set to the Netherlands instead of the United States.   Turn off "International Assist" in Settings > Phone, then (because this appears to be a Verizon issue) dial *228 to update the phone service choosing option 1. Follow this by calling a second time to *228 and select option 2. Once those updates are finished, power off the phone and start it up again. For me, that fixed the problem and I was able to turn the "International Assist" option back on and it was fine (turning it off may have been an be an extra step, but who knows). This also fixed how the telephone numbers appeared without hyphens.  Now all looks perfect.
