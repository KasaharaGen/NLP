Q: iPod energy saving I wonder if there is a difference in battery consumption between these two cases :


*

*I shut down the iPod with no app on.

*I shut down the iPod with an app on.


Is the app really paused, or is it still consuming power while "hibernate" ?

A: It should be close to the same; when you “suspend” your iPhone/Pod/Pad, all applications are suspended and only minimal services remain on (like Push, music player helper in case you press play from a headphone control, alarms if you have calendar, etc.). 
But 3rd party applications are stopped, unless they have a service using the multitask API. But say you have X-Plane running and you suddenly turn the device off (suspending it). The app is automatically saved to “memory” and the process is stopped. No additional battery should be used until the iPod is powered up again.
