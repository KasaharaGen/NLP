Q: Fast forward / backward on iPod Touch Is there an easy way (that I didn't find yet) the move quickly from one place to another while listen to a podcast or a song (as it was possible on my provious iPod Nano whith the "wheel" button) ?

A: Tap the album artwork to bring up the seek slider. You can then drag the slider to move from one place to another in the track.

A: Hold the skip forward/backwards button (Other known as "next song" button) for a few seconds. You'll fast forward/backwards in the song.
