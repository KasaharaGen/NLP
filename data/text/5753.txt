Q: How to determine what type of SSD drive is supported for a Macbook? I am leaning towards getting a SSD for my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009), since this is my first journey into SSD I was wondering if there was anything I needed to consider as far as drive specs when it comes to the mac. I am currently running Snow Leopard but will be upgrading to Lion shortly. As I understand Lion added Trim support, but I could not find a list of drives it supports Trim with.

*So does Lion support Trim on all SSD?

*Are there any other things I need to check to make sure the SSD I
purchase is compatible?


A: Jfw is right, until now apple only supports their official SSD. While there are some ways to open SSD trim support on 3rd party SSD, when I used these solutions I encountered some weird problems. 
Besides the trim support problem, some capability problems can be solved by updating SSD's firmware.
I currently use an Intel 320 300g SSD and installed lion without trim support, it has been working wonderfully.
Before I bought the Intel SSD, I had considered OWC's products and I think their products are good on capability, however since I am live outside of the United States I didn't choose it.

A: I think your best bet would be using a Samsung 830 (I believe Anandtech recommends it too). I'm having some issues with the Intel 330, so I'd recommend staying away from it.
