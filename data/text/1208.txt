Q: What does "iTunes err = -3259" mean? I am downloading some iTunes U content in iTunes and am getting 
stopped (err = -3259)

on a number of the downloads.  I was hoping to find a list of err codes, but no luck.  Found a lot of forum posts for other error numbers, but not that one.  
Any help?

A: I turned off "Allow simultaneous downloads" and now it is consistently downloading without a problem.  

A: As I search some I find that it happen because of antivirus:

What seemed to work for me was
  disabling anti-virus software during
  the load process. I killed my
  antivirus and then hit refresh on all
  of the podcasts that failed with err =
  -3259 and they all finished successfully.
Long term I think we need to get apple
  to resolve this issue, but in the
  meantime you can temporarily disable
  your anti-virus, complete your
  downloads and then bring the
  anti-virus back up.

And some where said that it because parental control:

Some of our users are reporting that
  unchecking Podcasts from the Parental
  Controls preference pane has resolved
  the issue. For some of our customers,
  simply going into: Edit - Preferences
  - Parental Control and unchecking Podcasts
