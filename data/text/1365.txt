Q: How do I disable Ping? Although I do like and enjoy using iTunes, I'm not a fan of the new Ping service that Apple has embedded into it. 
Is it possible to disable the Ping link under "Store", the Ping sidebar, and the Ping buttons next to each song? If so, how?

A: You can also restore the old arrow functionality

defaults write com.apple.iTunes show-store-link-arrows 1

I also suggest the following:
defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks 1


This setting switches the default
  behaviour of the arrow links. By
  default (well, by default in iTunes
  10.0.0 and before) the arrows would send the user to the corresponding
  page in the iTunes Store, but you
  could also hold down Opt and click to
  be redirected to the corresponding
  list in your own library.
Now, to reset it all to Apple's
  defaults... you can either do the same
  lines as above but replacing '1' with
  '0', or you can delete the settings by
  changing "write" to "delete" and
  removing the 1 from the end:

defaults delete com.apple.iTunes disablePingSidebar

defaults delete com.apple.iTunes hide-ping-dropdown

defaults delete com.apple.iTunes show-store-link-arrows

defaults delete com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks

restart when done.
I blogged about this when I read Tom Gidden's article

A: In iTunes 10.1, thereâ€™s a setting for that:

Additionally you can set a parental control that also disables Ping. 

A: If you dont like playing with the command line, I advise you to install Secret.
With this Preferences pane, you'll have access to hidden settings for a lot of applications (from Apple and third parties).
Then, all you have to do is go to the iTunes section and search for "Ping", like so:

If you know your way around Terminal.app, here are the commands:
defaults write com.apple.iTunes hide-ping-dropdown -bool TRUE

and 
defaults write com.apple.iTunes disablePingSidebar 1

Switch to -bool FALSE and disablePingSidebar 0 to if you want the default value again.
