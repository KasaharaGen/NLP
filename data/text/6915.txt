Q: USB 3 via ExpressCard/34 on a thunderbolt with parallels desktop Can I use an extenal  windows formatted USB3 harddisk on my mac connected via thunderbolt on the future Sonnet Echo-Expresscard/34-Thunderbolt-Adapter? It's clear I can use UBS3 HDs for Mac, but how is it when virtually running windows?

A: If the drive works on the Mac side, it will work under Windows within the virtual environment.  The hardware is virtualized, so Windows will not see it as a USB3 device.
