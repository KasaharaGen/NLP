Q: New folders are created in root instead of currently selected folder When I click on a folder and choose File->New Folder the folder is created in the root directory of my current view instead of the currently selected (highlighted) folder.
How do I make it so when I create a new folder it will create the folder inside of the current highlighted directory?

A: You can't.  Finder creates new folders in the folder currently being displayed, not the folder you've highlighted.  First you have to display the folder you want the new one in - double click it, then create the new one.

A: Open the folder you want to create the new folder in first (double-click). Then choose File->New Folder or Shift-Cmd-N.

A: There's no built-in way to do that in Finder (as of macOS 12 Monterey, 2021), but you can create a custom Automator action instead. This will provide a right click menu item, as well as a keyboard shortcut, to create a folder under the selected folder in Finder.
