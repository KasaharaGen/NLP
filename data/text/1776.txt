Q: Entourage MyDay replacement I am migrating from Entourage to Mac Mail. Entourage has a tool called MyDay which is quite handy for getting an overview over my appointments first day in the morning.
Is there a competitive product available which snycronizes with iCal appointments and todo list?


A: I think I found one app which could do the job on the app store, it's called "Today - Daily Calendar & Task Manager"


A: This software, iDeskCal might do it. It gives you access to iCal on your desktop, but it's unclear to me if it supports to-dos.
