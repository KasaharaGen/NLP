Q: iOS Wi-Fi sync won't work in VirtualBox I am trying to set up Wi-Fi sync of my iPod Touch (iOS 5) with iTunes 10.5.0.142 running on Windows XP.
They sync fine over the USB cable. I've enabled Wi-Fi sync both on the iPod and in iTunes. The Wi-Fi is functioning and I can ping the Windows XP machine from the iPod. However, the Wi-Fi sync won't work (the sync app on the iPod doesn't see the computer).
How do I go about troubleshooting this?
Notes:


*

*Windows XP is running inside VirtualBox on Ubuntu.

*I've checked out other similar questions, and none of them are relevant here.


A: I seem to have been able to figure this one out. In VirtualBox, select Devices/Network Adapters, and change Attached to from NAT to Bridged Adapter:

Click OK. Finally, reboot Windows and cold-restart the iPod.
This has fixed it for me.
