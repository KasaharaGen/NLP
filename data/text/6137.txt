Q: Lion: Change Keyboard shortcut CMD + ALT + Left/Right Arrow for spaces OR Firefox's next/previous tab I'm using Firefox, where CMD + ALT + ← / → Arrow changes to the next / previous tab. This is an important feature to me. 
Since Lion, this shortcut changes the active space to the next and previous space, with no way to customize this. And I want to use spaces, just no with the keybinding. Firefox also won't let me customize my shortcut. How can I change one of those?
(Hint: the Firefox extension "keyconfig" let's you do a lot of keybindings-changes, but not the previous and next tab ones).

A: You can change Mission Control's keyboard shorcut from System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard Shourtcuts window or bind specific shortcut key for Firefox in same window.

A: Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Control-Tab will have the same effect as CMD-ALT-← / →, and have the advantage of working in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.
It's also nice to rebind them to function or gamepad keys so you can browse without contorting your hand à la emacs.
