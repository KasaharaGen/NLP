Q: Lock screen on mac? w/o enabling "require password after sleep"

Is there a quick way to lock my Mac? 

I want to be able to lock my screen on Mac, much the way Windows+l does on windows. I do not want to have to put in a password each time my computer sleeps/screen saver turns on. I want a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen while still allowing the computer to wake from sleep without a password. I don't want my session logged out or suspended in any way.
Note* I would like a keyboard shortcut for this.

A: You can do this with Keychain Access, if you enable its menu bar icon. Directions here.
I'm not aware of a keyboard shortcut, sorry.

A: The WindowsKey + L combi works to lock the desktop (doesn't necessarily put it to sleep or start screen saver), in Macs its a little different in definition. To "lock" the desktop in Macs you would need to invoke a screen saver or turn off the display with a "Require password after sleep or screen saver"
To put the display to sleep the key combi is Cntrl+Shift+Eject. If your account has no "Require password", it wont ask for a password when it comes back on. (note: this isnt a "sleep" command - it just turns off the display, mac is still up and running).
Another method is to assign a hot corner to "put display to sleep"
