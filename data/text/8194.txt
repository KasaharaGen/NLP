Q: Anyone gotten 10.7.2 to bind properly to Active Directory in a multi-domain environment? I work for an international non-profit that has Active Directory with multiple domains. (A bunch of them.) We can't get Lion (10.7.2) to bind to it properly. Has anyone been successful in getting AD to work in Lion 10.7.2? We have a bunch of new Macs and can't get them on the network. We'll be testing AdmitMac this week, but would rather not pay more than $100 a machine to get them hooked up.

A: MacWindows has a lot of good feedback about this issue.  In my own testing I've found that 10.7.3 has certainly improved network logins on AD2003-bound Macs, though its still not as reliable (or fast) as I'd like.
As always, contact your SE and leave feedback about your issues.
