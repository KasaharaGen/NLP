Q: Can no longer edit my contacts in iOS 5 I just updated to iOS 5 on my iPhone 4, and now I can not edit my contacts. Where "edit" use to be is no longer there. If I type a new number on the keypad and hit add to existing contact, I can edit from there, but there is no "done" or "save". Not sure what to do.

A: This seems to be a bug. I ran into this same problem over the weekend when I was trying to add a new contact I had received over SMS. It seems that depending on how you get to the contact screen, the "Done" button may not be there. If you open the Contacts app (instead of getting to your contacts from the Phone app), you should get a contact screen that has the save button. Hope this helps. 

A: I had the exact same issue, the edit button mysteriously disappeared!
I was able to resolve my issue by going into settings -> iCloud and switching Contacts to ON.
