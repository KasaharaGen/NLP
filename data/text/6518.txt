Q: Used to be possible in Snow Leopard to move an app between `desktops` with a keyboard shortcut? You could assign a keyboard shortcut to move the app with focus to a specific desktop.  Can't find this in Lion.  Anyone know if it's still possible?

A: I figured out how to do this.  


*

*Open System Prefs > keyboard

*On Keyboard Shortcuts tab choose Mission Control

*Enable the "Switch to Desktop..." shortcuts 

*Now when you click on a window and perform the Switch to Desktop keyboard shortcut it'll move that window to the desktop


Guess there is a mouse component to this, so it's not pure keyboard.  But I find it way easier than dragging windows around in mission control.
