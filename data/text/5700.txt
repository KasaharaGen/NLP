Q: Where can I find a list of changes to Terminal.app in Lion? I'm thinking of upgrading to Lion after hearing that they've upgraded Terminal.app somewhat. The main thing I've heard is that Terminal.app now supports 256 colors, but I don't care about colors. I want mouse events in screen without using MouseTerm.
Where can I find all the changes to Terminal.app provided by Lion? Are mouse events included in this update?

A: I don't use mouse events, but they appear to at least partially work in iTerm 2, which does not require Lion or MouseTerm.  I tested with "set mouse=a" in vim and was able to select using the mouse, etc.

A: The Terminal changes in Lion aren't very major, from what I've seen, but they're listed here. Still no mouse events, unfortunately. If you have access, I suggest filing a feature request.
