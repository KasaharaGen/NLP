Q: Can I feed spoofed video to sites like omegle.com that require a connected camera? Sites like omegle.com want video from my connected camera, but I don't 
have one. How can I feed omegle.com (a Flash app) a spoofed video feed 
(eg, a static picture, mp4 file, etc?) 

A: iGlasses is one way to do this. It shows up as a camera on websites, and you can play a video or show an image by dragging it into the effects tab.

A: Theres a free application called ManyCam, I've used it on Facebook and ChatRoulette to display a picture or movie file instead of my iSight.

A: CamTwist creates "pseudo-video" devices for lots of different things, so you could display your desktop or any subset of it, or other content you choose. CamTwist's feature set is likely very similar to Ryan Sharp's suggestion for ManyCam.
