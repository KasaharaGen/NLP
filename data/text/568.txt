Q: Is it possible to use an iPad as an additional computer monitor? I just ran across this app from Maxivista that allows you to use your iPad as a second monitor. It's just like their other app that lets you use another computer as an additional monitor, such as a laptop. The problem is, however, it's a bit sluggish as it has to use WiFi to send what is basically a video signal.
So, are there any solutions that allow you to use an iPad as an additional screen via USB?

A: Recently Air Display announced a beta of the Windows client so now there are two choices but it also works only over Wifi so I would imagine they would both have lag issues.

A: Duet Display lets you easily turn an iPad or an iPhone into a secondary display. It works with both Mac and Windows computers.

A: Fast forward Fall 2019, macOS and iPadOS (rebranded the iOS operating system software running on iPad), now supports this natively.
The following Apple Support document talks in detail about using your iPad as your Mac's mirrored or extended display.
