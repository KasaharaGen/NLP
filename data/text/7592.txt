Q: FaceTime Failed: Person Not Available Consider an iPad 2 using WiFi attepting to make FaceTime calls to users on an iPhone 4. Each contact has their phone number defined under the iPhone tag (as opposed to Mobile). 
Whenever attempting a FaceTime connection, FaceTime attempts to connect, and fails with the error:

FaceTime failed - 'Person' is not available for FaceTime.

Measures attempted:


*

*close FaceTime from running apps.

*disable & re-enable FaceTime from Settings.

*confirmed the device's WiFi is active & enabled.


I've seen the 'solution' of "reset all settings", but suspect that's overkill, and likely won't work, as reported by lots of other users.
How can this error be avoided?

A: According to Apple, some of the symptoms are:


*

*When you are calling someone on FaceTime, the number on their screen
is not your number.

*People are unable to initiate a FaceTime call
with you. 

*After installing a new carrier settings update, FaceTime
does not activate.


How to fix:


*

*In Settings > Phone, turn FaceTime OFF and turn it back ON again

*Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset all settings

*Done


A: Also be sure that BOTH devices are on wifi, not just the iPad.
