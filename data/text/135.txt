Q: A better dashboard dictionary widget I find the default dictionary dashboard widget on my MacBook Pro to be very annoying. One, you type in a misspelled word and it says, ""x" could not be found" instead of being helpful and offering alternative spellings. Two, I can't copy and paste from it. 
Anyone know of a better one? Or maybe I should just use google?
Thanks.

A: Why not just use the Dictionary application itself? Does it have to be a widget? The Dictionary application has smart lookup and more tools than the widget.
