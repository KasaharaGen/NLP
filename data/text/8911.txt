Q: Is it possible to adjust Lightroom settings with scroll wheel I'm using Mac OS X 10.7.2 "Lion" and Adobe Lightroom 3.5. On Windows, it was possible to adjust settings in the Develop module (exposure, contrast,...) by clicking on that setting and using the scroll wheel. 
On my Mac, this doesn't work. Does anyone know if I can enable this?

A: I don't think it is easily possible to use your scroll wheel to adjust. The only way I can think of is writing a script that translates your scroll wheel action to a up and down arrow key action. but that would prevent you from using your wheel for other actions.
Possible alternative options are:


*

*Clicking on the number besides the slider and by holding your (left) mouse button and moving your mouse you can now adjust the slider.

*Click on the number then change the number with your keyboard arrow(up/down) keys. This works best for fine adjustments.

*Click on the slider then change the slider with tour keyboard arrow(up/down) keys. This works best for making somewhat bigger adjustments.


A: use usb overdrive software...its incredible to do this!
