Q: My iPod will not work, trying disk utility but now stuck I went to use my iPod yesterday after putting some new music on it and it said there was no music on it.   When looking at my iPod it said it was full. I tried to restore it on iTunes and it said it was corrupt and I got error 1430.
When I tried to take care of it with DiskUtility I may have worsened the problem.  I attempted to erase it, because it would not let me select repair.  That did not go through, but then it did let me try to repair it.  I tried, but that would not go through either.  I then looked at it in iTunes and it said it was empty.  I tried DiskUtility one more time and it now is giving me this:

What can I do now to get my iPod back? I don't care if I loose everything on my iPod.

A: To restore the files did you back up your iPod, or possibly do you have iCloud? This  program might help

A: If it doesn't matter if you lose all your data on your iPod or not, you can erase it with a dozen of other tools. But before you start with that, you should try to reset your iPod and see if it shows up on your Mac/iTunes.
If that doesn't help you out, you can try a hard reset. Maybe that one will help you out.
Normally, you should be getting some results with these resets and it should appear in DiskUtility.
