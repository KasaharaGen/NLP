Q: How to mute the microphone on Key-Down and unmute it on Key-Up? What I would like to have is:


*

*By default the microphone should be muted

*When CapsLock is Down the microphone should unmute

*When CapsLock is Up the microphone should mute
(Basically convert my Skype to act like a Walkie-talkie with a push-to-talk functionality)
I found the AppleScript that can change the volume input of the microphone, so the first step was easy, but I didn't find any way to even assign the CapsLock to a script. Note that my CapsLock key is turned off and I would't like to sTART experiencing something like tHIS.
If the CapsLock is very special I wouldn't mind using another key, but I want to achieve the same functionality.
Edit:
Probably it is not really possible to do it without using any application, so if there is an app that can do that, it would also work for me.

A: First, the AppleScript that inspects the key state and handles the mic enabling and muting:
if (modKeyDowntest()) then
  tell application "System Events" to set volume input volume 100
  repeat while modKeyDowntest()
  end repeat
  tell application "System Events" to set volume input volume 0
end if

on modKeyDowntest()
  set modKeyDown to do shell script "~/opt/checkModifierKeys shift"
  set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as integer
  set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as boolean
end modKeyDowntest

Note, that


*

*the script depends on the checkModifierKeys command line app (and it's path).

*inspects the state of shift instead of caps lock (other possibilities are cmd, option, control and caps lock - caps lock, however, means the status of caps lock, not the key state!)


In the second step we bind the script to a key shortcut. There are many applications that can do this (some listed in an answer in SuperUser) or as an Automator service. (C&P from Lri's answer...)

One more option is to save the script as an Automator service:
  
  
*
  
*Open Automator and choose the Service template.
  
*Utilities — Run Shell Script / Run AppleScript.
  
*Service receives [no input] in [any application].
  
*Add the script to the text area and save.
  
*Assign a shortcut in System Preferences — Keyboard — Keyboard Shortcuts — Services.
  

So, I assigned opt+shift+M to the script above and it enables the mic, keeping it unmuted as long as I hold shift. The mic is muted again when I release shift.

A: I have not used it, but Skii plugin for Skype, seems to provide what you're looking for:

Skii is a very easy to use and simple plug-in that uses the Skype API to simplify the Push-to-Talk function. The app gives the user the possibility to control the Skype Push-To-Talk function with just one button! a small utility that will definetly improve your Skype user experience but also your overall workflow.
