Q: Apple TV subtitles How can I find out if (and what languages) subtitles are included in Apple TV movies before i buy it?

A: Is this for translation or closed-captioning purposes? The languages a movie supports should be listed in iTunes, and all of the movies should (but might not) have closed-captioning for those with disabilities.
