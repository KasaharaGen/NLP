Q: Matlab on the command line error in Lion I constantly get this warning in Matlab, which I run on the command line:

This process is attempting to exclude an item from Time Machine by path without administrator privileges. This is not supported.

What can I do to prevent this?

A: It is reported here, they claimed that the issue is for all version of Matlab on Mac OS X Lion. So I guess you could simply use sudo to get this problem done. And wait with more patient for a fix.

A: Start Matlab as administrative user once so it can do the exclusion.

A: Running sudo matlab once worked for me.  This assumes that /Applications/MATLAB_R20???.app/bin has been added to PATH.
