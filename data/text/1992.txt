Q: Can Windows Vista be installed on Mac OS X 10.6.6? I heard that as of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple removed wording about installing Vista via Boot Camp, suggesting that they are no longer supporting it.
If I have Mac OS X 10.6.6 installed, can I still install a full version of Vista on it?

A: Yes, according to Apple's Snow Leopard Specs.

Boot Camp:
  requires Windows XP with
  Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista (sold
  separately).

Also, you can install Windows 7 if you update Boot Camp. Info here.
