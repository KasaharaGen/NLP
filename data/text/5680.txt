Q: iOS and Objective-C Training in Melbourne I'm sure this is not the correct forum for this but figured it was pretty close.
Does anyone know of any courses in Melbourne Australia for iOS development?
I've been developing in the MS arena my whole life and am looking at getting into Objective-C with regards to mobile devices but cannot seem to find any courses.
Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you.

A: Check out an iOS/iPhone Developer Training (Melbourne/Sydney) by jTribe

Schedule:

DAY ONE: Introduction to iPhone Development and the Objective-C
  Language On day one we start with Objective-C and will cover
  everything needed to start building iPhone applications. We will  dive
  straight into the core Objective-C syntax and constructs, use of Xcode
  as a development tool, the Foundation  framework, how to build your
  own Objective-C classes, properties and methods, a thorough
  explanation of memory  management issues on the iPhone and will use
  Xcode and GDB to debug an iPhone app. 
DAY TWO: Building a basic iPhone
  application, using Interface Builder, Views, View Controllers & Table
  Views Day two starts with the build of a complete iPhone app. We then
  look in depth into views, the iPhone view hierarchy,  the concept of
  delegates, Interface Builder and view controllers. We look in more
  detail into table views, navigation  and navigation controllers and
  learn techniques to ensure that our app can scale in the real world.
  DAY THREE: Application Navigation, Animation and Multi Touch,
  Deployment, Provisioning Profiles and the App  Store. On day three we
  look at image handling, resources and how to create those beautiful
  custom table cells. We  then go on to interacting with web services
  and building our very own Twitter client before we take a deeper look
  at  the development and deployment process, iTunes connect, the App
  Store and marketing
