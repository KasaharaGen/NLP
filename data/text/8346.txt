Q: How do I restore my iphone? I tried to upgrade my iphone 3GS to iOS 5 today, but the upgrade failed saying 'an unknown error occurred'.  Now my phone is in a weird state where you can't turn it on properly, it just goes to a screen with a picture of a USB cable pointing into an itunes logo.  
I plug it into itunes and I go through this sad sequence of events:  





I have tried 3 times now and always the restore fails with this same error.  What are my options now?  Losing all my media and other data was bad enough, but now not even having a working phone is kind of crippling.
I am using the latest version of iTunes, and my phone has never been jailbroken.  
Here is the logfile of the updater:

2011-10-20 04:02:14.787 [3428:c84]: iTunes: Restore error 1604


A: Did you try restarting your pc? And did you also try to restart your iphone by holding the home button and the top button and the same time until the apple logo comes back on? You might have to take it to the apple store. They can diagnose it and also just restore it and update it for you. And if you're still on the warranty, they might even replace it. Good luck. 

A: From the relevant Apple support document, especially the part concerning error 1604:

This error is often related to USB timing. Try changing USB ports, uninstalling and reinstalling USB ports, and other available USB troubleshooting steps (troubleshooting USB connections, device not recognized properly, computer won't recognize a FireWire or USB device). If you are using a dock, bypass it and connect directly to the white Apple USB dock connector cable.

The support document further recommends to restart iTunes if 1604 occurs while leaving the phone connected.

A: @patrix's answer is right.
I had this error as well.  It turned out to be faulty USB hardware.  I used a different computer to restore iOS, then returned to the original computer.  I unplugged every USB device except for the mouse, keyboard and wifi.  I restarted the PC, plugged in the iPhone, started iTunes, and restored from backup.  This got it going perfectly and now I just use wifi syncing rather than use the faulty USB ports.

A: I'm pretty sure this has to do with the 3rd party anti-virus. Review this article on apple.com
