Q: Change network location automatically based on network 
Possible Duplicates:
Can the built-in OS X “Location” feature auto select locations based on wireless networks?
Can I automate location changing so I don't have to drive the choice manually?
Start/stop internet sharing from a script?

Is it possible in Mac OS X to somehow make it change the network location from a custom location profile to automatic when leaving the home network without having to manually adjust the settings in system preferences?

A: Although not automatically, a shorter way to go is in the menu: apple->Location and then choose your location,.

A: Airport Location** does that. 
** Update 10/2016: Airport location appears to be no longer maintained, but still available at MacUpdate.com. It may be limited to older versions of OS-X. The same site suggests ControlPlane provides similar functionality; I have not used it.
