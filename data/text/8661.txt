Q: Where is the insert key on a MacBook Air? I am trying to edit a line of code within a program that I use for work.
I need to use the insert key to be able to add additional spaces that I can then type letters, numbers or characters.
How to get this function to work on my MacBook Air?

A: It depends on the physical keyboard and on the keyboard layout. You can try...
ctrl+fn+M
OR 
ctrl+fn+⌫

A: FN + Return works for me to insert.

A: FN + Return = Insert
(MacBook Air 13)
Also Works on MacBook Pro.

A: I need the insert key in the Midnight Commander (MC) running in Terminal and in Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) when connecting to my Windows PC.
For Midnight Commander the answer is Ctrl+T.
For RDP I did not find better solution than to use a free program on Windows AutoHotkey and map the key to chosen key combination, for instance this macro maps the Insert key to Ctrl+Alt+I :
^!i::
Send {INSERT}

A: I posted a possible answer to this question in a similar question topic on StackExchange:

In it, I'm explaining how to re-map the key combination Fn+Ctrl to Insert using Karabiner.

A: On the latest Macbook Air 13" ctrl+⌫ works.
