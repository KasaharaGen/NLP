Q: iTunes keeps respawning

Why does iTunes re-open after I quit? 

Hey,
I have some rather annyoing behavior with my system:
Whenever I close or kill -9iTunes it just keeps coming back up.
Any ideas how I can find the root cause of this?

A: Do you use any add-ons / controllers for iTunes, like Media Servers (eg. Plex, Front Row) or others for global hot-keys or song notifications? Sometimes these apps use applescript, which tends to launch applications if theyÂ´re not already running.
