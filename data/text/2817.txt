Q: Force a file to overwrite instead of appending I've got an application that won't overwrite a file with the same filename. It will only append the filename with a 'space 1'. If I write a file more than once I get something like this:


*

*filename.jpg

*filename 1.jpg

*filename 2.jpg


What I need is to only ever have the newest file without the extra space and number.
Is there anyway around this? Perhaps an applescript running in the folder?

A: The application is in complete control of how it saves files (overwrite v. append). The answer is to pre-clean your destination before you start whatever work flow you are doing in Capture One. There are any number of ways to accomplish that. 


*

*use the rm command from the terminal

*write a bash script that does something more complicated

*write an applescript

*create a new folder each time to point the application at

*create a disk image via Disk Utility that you can clone and throw away when finished


These are just some of the ideas. I am sure there are other ways as well. Just need to find one that works for you.
A final thought, contact the makers of Capture One and make a case for why you would like them to change the software. Perhaps they will listen. :)
Good luck.
