Q: How to keep iPod in shuffle mode after selecting a specific song? I'm using the iPod on my iPhone 4 in shuffle mode. If I go back to songs menu and select a specific song, the iPod forgets that it is in shuffle mode. It will play the next song in alphabetical order.
Is there any way to make shuffle mode setting stickier?

A: Hit the screen when your in the iPod app once so that the scrubber bar appears. In the right corner is a shuffle button. Hit that and it should stick
