Q: What is the best free FTP server for Mac OS X Server? I'm running Mac OS X Snow Leopard server on a mac mini and was wondering what the best free FTP server was? I hear okay things about pure-ftpd but I'd like something with an easy to manage UI as well etc...

A: Unless you’re planning on running an extremely heavy loaded FTP server (which the mini won’t be able to handle anyway) the built in FTP Server should be enough. 
Pure-ftpd is a classic in the Unix world and I’m sure you can of course make that run under OS X, but it doesn’t have a “UI”, it’s all command line. (But very easy to configure anyway).

A: edit: sorry, speed read and missed the part about best free server. Rumpus is not free.
Hands down best FTP server for OS X is Rumpus. We use it at work to deliver content to clients and also to receive content from providers. Extremely easy to use, but is also very configurable. We have been using it for years & he dev has always replied to our emails within 24hrs.
Worth a try, it will not disappoint! 

A: The built in web server is great, and the Server Admin tools in Mac OS Server also make managing the machine awesome as well.

A: That is correct. The build in FTP is great.
But Symbolic Links show up as binaries as soon as the mapped driver is not on the system it self but an network share.
So it's is not usable for me. And there is no alternative that has the same quality standards as OS X.
I've been asking all over the place but the question is asked several times no one has an answer. That is a pitty.
