Q: How to disable WebGL in the Chrome browser on Mac OS X How does one disable Google Chrome from using WebGL on a Mac (Mac OS X 10.6)?
(There currently appears to be some sort of security advisory regarding this component.)

A: Chrome lets you disable WebGL using the about:flags page.
Type about:flags into the URL bar and press return.
Find the Disable WebGL flag and enable it. Restart Chrome for changes to appear.


A: Well, seems that in the latest versions of Chrome this flag cannot be disabled from about:flags. In order to disable it:


*

*Close chrome (if running)

*Open the terminal.

*Type: open -a "Google Chrome" --args  -disable-webgl

*Profit!


A: Not sure how to do this in OS X, but you may be able to do so by running chrome from terminal with the "-disable-webgl" flag.
