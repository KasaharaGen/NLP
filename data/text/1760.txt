Q: Great iPod Click Wheel Games for Kids My niece has got a used iPod nano (not the newest model); in the App Store are about 50 games for iPods with Click Wheel. What game can you recommend?

A: Vortex and Pacman are quite good as well. They're listed in iTunes as 5th generation compatible (Sonic... is for 3rd, 4th and 5th generation devices). I've got a 30GB video capable iPod and they all work fine...

A: I have fond memories of the Sonic the Hedgehog game on older iPods :)
