Q: How can I specify delimiters in Terminal for word and character selection before copying and pasting? I am new to Mac and still struggling to be productive with fewer clicks and keys...
When I use Terminal and click on a word, I would like the delimiter to be only space and not other characters like . _ / etc. I want these to be treated as part of the word. Then, I would like to be able to click on a word, be able to select the whole word and then copy and paste it to another place, say command line or into an editor etc. How do I achieve this?
Many thanks!

A: You might want to take a look at iTerm2, where you can set the word delimiter in the preferences. I'm a recent convert myself and like it a lot better than Terminal.app. There's a special Terminal.app keyboard shortcut compatibility set to make switching easier.
