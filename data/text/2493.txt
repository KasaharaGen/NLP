Q: Replacement DVD drive for MacBook Pro Howdy. I have a MacBook Pro 15" (MB133LL/A) with a Matsushita UJ-867 DVD drive. The DVD drive is failing and I'm looking for a replacement.
Are there any other supported drives for this machine than the UJ-867?

A: There are some variations in the drives supplied in Apple's products. For example, often Apple will have multiple suppliers for a part, and products often have hardware options. As such there will be other drives that are supported.
I find sites such as iFixIt or Other World Computing that are targeting DIY repair and upgrades are helpful as they provide a guide to which parts are compatible with various Mac and MacBook models.
Here are some results for your MacBook Pro:
