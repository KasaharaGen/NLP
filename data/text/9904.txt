Q: show or copy password instead of dots in application In windows i had a program to inspect the password that i stored in filezilla.
But I forgot my ftp password I can still see the dots but I want to see what the password was that I stored.
Is there anything like that for the mac?
I found a solution for filezilla.
In the filezilla menu use "file->Export".
Save the file to a location
An XML file is generated with al the ftp sites entry's
Open the file with a browser and you should be able to see the passwords

A: Yes, of course. Try finding your "Keychain"-program,which is in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.
After entering you admin pass, you can view all the passwords stored by your Mac. WiFi passwords, website-logins,...
