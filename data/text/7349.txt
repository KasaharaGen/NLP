Q: After Lion upgrade, external monitor sometimes shows color noise Hardware:


*

*Early 2011 (pre Thunderbolt) MBP 15"

*Apple Mini Display to DVI adapter

*Dell 2408WFP (using included DVI cable)


Before upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion, I did not have this problem. None of the hardware has changed.
The problem is that sometimes, briefly after connecting my external monitor (sometimes as quickly as 1 minute, sometimes as long as 5), the picture starts displaying color noise. From the time that I connect the monitor until the color noise, the picture displays fine and I can put applications there and use them. During the noise, I can even drag an app over to that screen and back (hidden behind the noise, not on top of it).
I've tried using a friend's Mini-Display to DVI adapter, and that didn't fix it.
What's really, really annoying is that it's temporary. I come to work in the morning and connect the monitor after logging in. Then I may have to disconnect and reconnect it 3-4 times before the noise doesn't come back. I also occasionally see a little bit of noise in the picture in the minutes before the whole screen becomes noise.
I haven't been able to find any forum posts/etc of anyone else having the same issue. Any ideas?
