Q: migrating Ubuntu DHCPD to OS X Server My LAN includes an Ubuntu 9.04 server which runs an ISC DHCP v3 daemon. I'd like to migrate the data from that daemon to a Lion OS X Server. Is there an easy way to do this (by copying the Ubuntu /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf and importing it into OS X Server)? Lion's /etc/bootpd.plist doesn't seem to contain the information about individual machines (MAC, IP): where are these stored?
