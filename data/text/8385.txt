Q: How to override the play/pause function of the button in earphone remote control? I enjoy using Keyboard Maestro to set custom keys to take control of apps,  I can apply more functions to the play/pause button in the earphone remote, but by default it is set to control iTunes. 
How to disable or overwrite the default setting of these button?
I'm using a Mac, and use the iPhone earphone with remote
