Q: Is there a good replacement for the Dock? 
What are the best dock replacements?
It's frustrating to keep track of
  windows in the dock unless they're
  minimized. For instance, I often have
  10-15 separate PDF documents open.
  It's a mess to keep track of them on
  the dock.

A: A quasi-replacement worth considering is Quicksilver (download: https://qsapp.com/ and guide: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBvFUhTqKK4), used by a large number of devout users.
Though, that it depends on what you're looking to replace: access to apps, documents, tasks etc? It should work great. If you want something that looks vaguely like a dock/taskbar/GNOME panel, it won't replace that.

I was impressed with this. It is the closest thing to a task bar replacement I found. Some of its behavior annoyed me so I did not purchase it at the end of the trial. You may fare diffently.
The DOCK is rather ill conceived for a variety of reasons, but programs leaving the dock when open is a huge one. Finding open windows is OSX is far more difficult than in Windows. alt-tab > cmd+tab then cmd+~. Seeing the window clearly on the task bar is also nice.
EDIT: I found this forum while looking for a replacement for ubar. I was unable to find one worth a crap. So I ended up buying Ubar, even tho it has some issues. Even with its issues it is better than the dock. The dock is a common complaint for windows users; this isnt a case of stubborn users rejecting change or a different way of doing things. This is a case of the taskbar really being the better way fulfill these functions. 

A: HyperDock gives you window previews for each running app in the dock, which helps tremendously. 


A: Ubar is very nice. But I don't think it's a dock replacement. Because for me a big job of the dock is the list of icons for my commonly used apps. As far as I can tell, uBar doesn't do that...@Edward

A: I'm an ActiveDock developer, the application is actively developing, version 2 is now available

A: System Preferences->Dock: set "minimize windows into application icon".
