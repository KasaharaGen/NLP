Q: Why do I get a plain blue screen when I connect my Mac Mini to an external monitor? I have one of the new mac mini's and run multiple users on it.  At any time up to 5 users may be logged in.  I have a keyboard and monitor that I connect to alot of machines so very often the mini has no monitor plugged in.  When I connect my monitor - Dell Monitor, VGA to HDMI adapter that came with mini - I get just a plain blue screen.  It looks like the blue that you see when the mac is switching users.  
I've turned off all the energy saver options thinking that it might be going to sleep and not awaking.  Any other ideas as to what might be causing this and how I can prevent it?  Every time I connect my monitor I need to reboot to use the mini.
Update:  I've tried a couple of more things - I turned off the screen saver also, I tried connecting to the machine using LogMeIn (http://logmein.com) all with similar results.  It's as if when a monitor is not attached the mac stops outputting display.  It is still running, I just can't get the display to work.
Update - this what I get when I SSH in and do a top command:

A: Finally figured this out.  The issue had to do with the fact that I am using multiple users and Fast User Switching.
You can read more details about it in this thread:  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2177922&start=15&tstart=0
The gist is that each user has it's own loginwindow process running.  These multiple loginwindow process' reek havoc with any method of remote controlling the mac -VNC, Apple Remote Desktop, LogMeIn even unplugging/plugging in a monitor is affected.  
So you need to kill all loginwindow processes before connecting.
To do this:  


*

*Connect via ssh

*issue a ps auxwww|grep loginwindow to find the current loginwindow processes that are running - there will be one for each user + one for console

*for each process call sudo kill -9 pid where pid is the process id


* note:  you do not need to kill the loginwindow for console
Much thanks to Martin Marconcini who led me down the path of investigating the running processes via SSH.
