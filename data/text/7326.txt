Q: Can OS X Lion Server automatically set up Mail using Open Directory information? This is my first experience with OS X Server, I setted Open Directory up and added some accounts through Workgroup Manager.
When I login in on one of the remote Apple computers with one of the network accounts it mounts the file sharepoints nicely. But it doesn't automatically configure the Mail.app.
I searched on the internet but Lion differs a lot from (Snow) Leopard at this point. Is there anyone who can help me find the right setting to configure this?
