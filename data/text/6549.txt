Q: Pages 09 4.0.3 wants an update When I open Pages 09 4.0.3, it tells me I need a software update; yet, running Software Update responds that all software is up to date.
I believe there is a later version of Pages with improved Lion support (like full page modes).
I've been to Apple Support pages download section: No dice.
How can I get that upgrade?

A: Ensure that the applications reside in /Applications/iWork '09 or the software update process does not seem to find them.
