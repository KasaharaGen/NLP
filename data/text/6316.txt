Q: Is it safe to run a Mac Mini (i5) on its side? I recently got a Mac Mini with the i5 chip. Is it OK to set it on its side and run it that way? I wanted to shrink the footprint.

A: Sure.  Just make sure it is in a secure position so it doesn't fall over.  
Apple actually has a support page on this:  http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22804

A: No it's not. It will heat up fast.
