Q: Can I use a jailbroken iPhone on Virgin Mobile? I am no longer on a contract with AT&T. Virgin Mobile has an awesome Beyond Talk plan for $25 (unlimited text, data, web, well I guess a max of 5.5Gb). Can I use a SIM card from a Virgin Mobile phone on my jailbroken iPhone? 
Also, is it possible to buy just a SIM card from Virgin?
TIA

A: No. Virgin Mobile is a part of Sprint (they used to be a Sprint MVNO). Sprint uses CDMA, not GSM, so they do not have SIM cards.
So, no iPhone on Sprint at least until Apple makes a CDMA iPhone and sells them for Sprint.
