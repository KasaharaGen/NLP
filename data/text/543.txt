Q: iPhone iOS4 Connectivity Profiles Is there any way to set up and easily switch connection profiles in iOS4?
i.e:
Home - Wi-Fi on, Bluetooth off, 3G off
Work - Wi-Fi off, Bluetooth off, 3G off
Car - Wi-Fi off, Bluetooth on, 3G on
etc.
Would prefer an App Store app but would consider a jailbreak app if not available.

A: If your phone is jailbroken, SBSettings works really well for this. I don't think it supports profiles, but it gives quick access to toggles for all of the services you mentioned. Very helpful for the scenarios you described.

A: You will definitely have to jailbreak to acheive that kind of functionality.  Personally I gave @Thomas' reply a +1 because that is what I used to use.
Another option is Intelliborn's MyProfiles Beta - which is on sale for $7 via Rock
It may only support iOS 3.0.1 though.
