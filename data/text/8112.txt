Q: How can I configure autofs with indirect map using sshfs? How can I configure autofs with an indirect map using sshfs?
What I've done so far:


*

*added /servers auto_sshfs to /etc/auto_master

*created /etc/auto_sshfs with * -fstype=sshfs &:/

*Ran sudo automount -vc
I'm assuming that either I have fstype flag incorrect, in the wrong place or I some how need to let autofs know of sshfs.
