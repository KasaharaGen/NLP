Q: How do I read .CHM files in OS X? What software do I need to open and read a .chm document in OS X?

A: One of the best apps I've found is iChm. It has a Spotlight importer as well as the app itself.*  It's free as well as being open source.
Only issue I've had with it is that sometimes long "m dashes", like â€”, will not be present, and instead the two words will be run together. (Though, I've looked at the source code myself, and it appears to actually be a problem with libchm, the open source library that iChm relies on).
*NOTE: the version of iChm in the link above (1.4.2) does not have a Spotlight importer, but I've forked this project on GitHub and added a Spotlight importer in version 1.5. You can download 1.5 at http://www.markdouma.com/developer/iChm.zip. 
The GitHub project is at https://github.com/NSGod/ichm (it may be a day or so before I've pushed all of the changes).

A: A little bit googled and find this.

Hope it helps...

A: There are multiple viewers available. This article lists five.
I've never used any of these myself, but many are free or shareware. Give them a try.

A: While installing iChm on El Capitan, it was showing me a security warning. So, instead of changing my security settings, I gave CHM Reader from App Store a try. Works well for me.
