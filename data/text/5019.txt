Q: Is it possible to filter which applications can use my iPhone's Personal Hotspot? Is it possible to filter which applications (in Windows) can use my iPhone's Personal Hotspot?

A: No, it is not possible. Even by jailbreaking would not enable this, or more exactly not in a practical way.

A: Technically yes you can but it depends on what firewall you use.
Since the connection to the Hotspot will be a distinct Network Connection (interface), if your firewall will allow you limit apps based on process name and interface, then this will in fact achieve your goal.
