A: I'm a realist and like to see how finder does in duplicating some folders that I have data in. Documents and Music seem to give me a decent mix and you can subscribe to the apple keynote podcast to get some nice large files to test sustained reads and writes. 
You can get a nice graph of the speed using Activity Monitor.
