Q: Memory in early 2008 Mac Pro I have an early 2008 Mac Pro.  It currently has 6G of ram (2x1G and 2x2G sticks).  I've been swapping with some programs for a while, and just got around to buying more ram.  (4x4G).  
My question is. . . am I better off just running the 4x4G or should I just add the 4x4G to the ram I already have?  (my gut says more is better, of course just add, but I know there are often hardware considerations that may make this not true)

A: Considering you have Pairs of equal memory (2x1G, 2x2G and 4x4G) the best option is to install them all (that's a lot of RAM!).
Early 2008's Mac Pros use the full memory bandwidth when modules are installed in Pairs (like you have). But their location in the risers (where you install the modules) is important. Therefore, you should follow what the manual says.
Since you're going to fill all the 8 slots, you can go ahead an install them in pairs one next to the other. You have 2 risers, so here's how you should put them:
TOP RISER
SLOT 1: 1x4GB
SLOT 2: 1x4GB
SLOT 3: 1x4GB
SLOT 4: 1x4GB
BOTTOM RISER
SLOT 1: 1x2GB
SLOT 2: 1x2GB
SLOT 3: 1x1GB
SLOT 4: 1x1GB
The graphic explanation for this can be read in the Early 2008 Mac Pro Memory Manual, located at manuals.info.apple.com.
