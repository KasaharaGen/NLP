Q: Delayed image on second monitor, MacBook Pro 13 inch i5 I have a 2011 MacBook Pro conected to a LG Flatron L19WS monitor through a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter and the image is delayed from the MacBook Pro to the actual monitor. How can I fix this?

A: The problem is because analogue (VGA) connection is used and the "auto" positioning does not detect the image bounds correctly. Check your monitor controls (menu) and move the image left/right and up/down (usually labeled HPOS/VPOS). Here are my recommendations:


*

*Use the native resolution (1440 x 900) and 60 Hz refresh rate.

*If still not centered, use the monitor's controls to position the image.

*If this does not work - try lowering the resolution or changing the refresh rate and again centering the image.


A: If by "delay" you mean offset (delay relates specifically to time in English) then that is easily changed. You change the relationships between monitors by going to System Preferences and choosing Displays. Click on the Arrangement tab. That tab will allow you to change how  monitors are relatively positioned "virtually" by dragging them.
