Q: Spotlight reports "Indexing and searching disabled" in Lion Lion keeps "losing track" of Spotlight information. Directories and Applications disappear, full text searches stop working, etc. I seem to need to re-index it once a week or so. 
However, now it appears to not work at all.
Running 
sudo mdutil -i on /

from the Terminal I get a message
"Indexing and searching disabled."

I have tried trashing preference files, deleting the whole V100 folder, repairing permssions, etc but Spotlight still thinks indexing is turned off on my entire Volume (Yes have added/deleted whole disk from Spotlight's privacy preferences").
In the console I have quite a few errors that look like this
mds: (Error) Server: Disabled store registered for scope "/Applications"

However, I do not know how to tell it to re-enable that scope as mdutil gives an error when I try to turn on indexing and gives an error when I try to delete the index 
EDIT: I reinstalled Lion. It did not fix the problem(s) :(

A: sudo mdutil -i off /
sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight*
sudo rm -rf /.metadata_never_index
sudo mdutil -i on /
sudo mdutil -E /

A combination of the above worked for me.  Step 3 was the big one.  Got rid of the "Indexing and searching disabled." message.  Then steps 4 and 5 worked as expected.


*

*turn indexing off

*delete Spotlight folder

*delete metadata file

*turn indexing on

*rebuild


A: I had the exact same problem, with all solutions above failing identically. Then I reexamined the directory listing for / and found a hidden file .metadata_never_index in the root directory. I removed this file and was able to turn spotlight on again with 
mdutil -i on /.
mds is now reindexing the hard disk, all looks good for now.

A: After all of the initial troubleshooting steps: 


*

*Rebuild the index 

*Attempt in another user account

*Dump prefs/cache and start over


I found the issue lied in what was enabled/disabled. In terminal, I ran "mdutil -sa" and got:
/:
    Indexing enabled. 
/Groups:
    Indexing disabled. 
/Shared Items/Public:
    Indexing disabled.
/Users:
    Indexing disabled. 
/Users/sarah/Documents:
    Indexing enabled. 

I noticed "/Users: Indexing disabled." That's the problem there. The fix: "sudo mdutil -i on /Users". After that, it re-indexed /Users, which took significantly longer than it had before, and before it was finished, it was searching my Mail!

A: This can also be caused by getting stuck in safe mode.  To fix that, you need to reset the  NVRAM by holding down the Command ⌘, Option ⌥, P, and R keys immediately after rebooting (before the gray screen appears).

A: sudo mdutil -i off /
sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight*
sudo mdutil -i on /
sudo mdutil -E /

1 - turn indexing off
2 - delete Spotlight folder
3 - turn indexing on
4 - rebuild
Does this help?
Also it seems you could use these commands:
sudo mdutil -a -i off
sudo mdutil -a -i on


A: The other solutions didn't work for me, however the following was the culprit in my case.
Make sure your root/main hard drive isn't in the "privacy" settings for spotlight. For some reason I had the whole hard drive under the "Prevent spotlight from indexing the following locations" list.
You can access this section from System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy

A: I noticed this issue after my iMac installed the software update 10.7.4 to my machine. Most of the suggested command-lines would produce 'Indexing and searching disabled'. sudo mdutil -pEsav gave me 'datastore publishing not implemented.'
Below is the solution that worked:


*

*edit /etc/hostconfig

*add the line  SPOTLIGHT=-YES- at the bottom (this line was missing)

*reboot


(after reboot make some soup while your machine prepares the index)

A: Only the combination of -E and -i on worked for me:
sudo mdutil -E -i on /Volumes/blah


A: This worked for me: Re-enable Spotlight Indexing

sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist



A: I've tried for days about every solution out there for Big Sur, and the combination of these steps seemed to solve it for me. Trust me I didn't want do disable system integrity either but it's the only thing that worked:

*

*Disable system integrity (restart -> hold cmd + r -> select utilities terminal -> csrutil disable -> restart again)

*run

sudo rm /System/Volumes/Data/.metadata_never_index



*run

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist



*run

sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist



*Reenable system integrity csrutil enable following steps in step #1

Specifically the problem I had was I could not search applications. As you can see in the image, I can now see the application and it will successfully open it.
Also, notice the index loading indicator:
