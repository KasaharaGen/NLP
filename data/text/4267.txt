Q: Can I create Windows-style alias in Finder? In Windows, we can hold down Ctrl or use right mouse button while dragging the file in Explorer. When we release mouse button we see a menu where we can choose 'Create shortcut'. 
It's quite handy, I think. Can we do something similar in Mac OS?
UPDATE: I do know how to create aliases, I'm interesting whether I can automatically create alias for the folder by just holding some key while dragging or smth like that.

A: Click any file or folder, press and hold down the ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option keys, and then drag the file or folder while continuing to hold down the ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option keys.
An alias appears where you release the mouse button.

A: In Mac OSX you Control+Click (or use the right mouse button) on the file and choose the menu item "Make Alias" then you can place the created Alias wherever you want. This is the same as your shortcut in Windows.
