Q: How can I compress a folder into multiple zip files? I'm on mac osx.
1.
Is there any tool to compress a folder into multiple zip files ?
2.
Is there any tool to split a compressed zip file into smaller zip files (to open individually later)?

A: Use the -s switch on the zip command in terminal. So if your folder was called FolderName
zip -r -s 64 archive.zip FolderName/

64 is the size of the split (in this case 64Mb).
Use -s to set the split size and create a split archive.  
The size is  given  as  a  number  followed optionally  by  one  
of  k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB) (the default is m). [1]

Use zipsplit to split a zip file in to multiple smaller zipfiles.  Use the -n switch to set the size of the splits.

A: I just found Keka, maybe it can interest you, and it's free.
