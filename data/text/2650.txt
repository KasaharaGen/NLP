Q: Change Spotlight's Top Hit? Say I have two apps that match a search in spotlight (e.g. utility), it seems that Spotlight chooses the first application (sorted alphabetically) as the Top Hit. Is there any way to change this so that a different application appears on top?

A: Just use some other launcher. Alfred is also good at learning new associations. If for example you select "Disk Utility" after typing "ut", it will become the new default suggestion for "ut". Very low-maintenance.
You could also try Apptivate. It allows you to assign 2-letter shortcuts (like ‚å•UT) for launching applications.

A: Try adding a Tag to the item to see if that helps.

*focus on the item and cmd+I to Get Info.

*In the "Add Tags" field, add something like utility.


In my experience, the Tags seem to bump up the item in Spotlight.

A: One way is to drag the application into the Applications folder (if it isn't already there), and rename it so that it appears on top (e.g. - My Utility).
