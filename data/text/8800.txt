Q: Is there an application for sharing wi-fi passwords? There are a lot of public wi-fi networks (diners, restaurants, cafes, universities). They are password protected. The password rarely (if ever) changes (only mcdonalds prints a temp password on the receipt).
I'm so very tired of asking for the password. I need to find a waiter. Sometimes they tell you a password that is not correct. Means I have to ask again.
Is there an application that shares wi-fi passwords between different people? 
For example, someone goes to Joe's Cafe, gets the wi-fi password from the waitress, and in the background (ideally) an application puts the password on a server. Then another guy/gal enters the cafe and automatically has the password from the same server and connects, to the wi-fi without having to talk to the waitress.
Thanks,

A: I've searched in the iOS AppStore. I didn't find such an application. I also looked in Cydia, but no such application exists. Android's Market also said no.
Here are my thoughts on why such an application does not exist:


*

*Sharing someone else's wifi password is an issue. He/she gave it to you so you can have internet. He/she hasn't agreed that you share it with the world. In the case of internet cafes, they have passwords so that only clients can use their wi-fi.

*I spoke with an company that develops iOS applications. They said no public API exists that allows the application to get saved wi-fi passwords or to make the phone connect to a new wi-fi network.

*Such an application most probably will not be accepted in the iOS AppStore (I have been told from the same company)

*There are issues with implementation. How without an internet would one get the password that is needed for a concrete wi-fi network? Preload all passwords in the application? Use 3g to get that specific password?


Even though I think such an application would make people's lives a bit easier, I think there are too many problems for it to be implemented.
