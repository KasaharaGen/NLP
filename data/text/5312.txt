Q: How can I remove a folder that no longer exists from my Finder sidebar in Lion? There is a folder in my favorites in the sidebar of the finder on my Mac. That folder no longer exists, but for some reason it started showing up again as soon as I upgraded to Lion
When I right-click to delete the folder, nothing happens. Normally, for most folders, I see a "Remove from Sidebar" option, but alas, I do not for this folder.
Does anyone know a way to edit this list from the terminal? Has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution?

A: This is how you do as described here:

To remove something from the Finder sidebar, hold Command as you drag
  it out.


A: I was having the same issue and here's what just worked for me:
Hold command, then drag it off the Favorites bar.  The item will turn into a little "poof" white cloud and when you release, it'll go away! Finally!

A: All you have to do is click with 2 fingers on your trackpad or ctrl+click on the item and 'remove from sidebar'. 

A: If the CMD+Option drag doesn't work (Pre 10.6.7 and all 10.5 for example), I suggest re-creating the same filename in it's same location (if you remember) then deleting the sidebar item, then re-deleting the folder... this was much easier to explain to a non-technical user than modifying the .plists
Later versions of 10.6 and all 10.7 allow the cmd-option drag, so that's the easiest if it works.
