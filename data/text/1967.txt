Q: What does "plays" really count in iTunes? iTunes displays the number of "plays" for each track. What exactly does this mean?
For example, playing a little bit of a track does not seem to increment the number. But playing most, but not all, of a track seems to.
Does playing n seconds trigger the increment? n percent of the track? Or something else?
I have a 4GB iPod Mini, if that matters.
The motivation is, I have iTunes set to automatically delete podcasts after they're played, and I don't want to accidentally trigger a deletion.

A: I believe that you just have to listen to the last few seconds of a song. You can skip all of the beginning part, and it will increment the Plays if you listen to the end.

A: In the behavior I have seen in the 5+ years of podcast listening. iTunes marks it as played based on a percentage listened. My guess is that would be about 98-99% listened. A 5 minute show would basically be the end. An hour and a half show would be just the last few seconds. 

A: In case Nathan G's answer wasn't super-clear: play count == number of times the file played right to the very end.  That means you need to let an audio file play right to completion - either until the next track starts to play, or you are returned back to the song list (if it is the last track in the list).

A: Nathan G. answer was right but I want to add some other info, if you let iTunes play last second of your song and go to another song it ++ your plays of that song, but if you click other song to play and the remaining time of current song is <5s still iTunes ++ play for that song.
