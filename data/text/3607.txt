Q: Microsoft Office 2011 is sluggish I am a the tech support guy for a small church. we just purchased Microsoft office 2011 for mac.
we have noticed it drastically slows our imac (not sure on the specs atm) when one of the office products is running.
has anyone else noticed this or is it something on just our machine 

A: Two things you can try : 
1) Make sure you have the latest updates installed.  Office 2011 has been updated since release, so it pays to ensure the latest versions of all applications are installed.
2) Perform a Repair Permission on your Macs hard disk.  This has been known to cure slowdowns in a a few Applications including Office 2011.  Repair Permissions is a feature of Disk Utility found in the Utility folder in Applications.
