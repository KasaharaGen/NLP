Q: Solutions to earphone jack distortion My earphones would not longer go all the way in / click into the earphone jack on my (out of warranty) iPhone 3GS. The sound was fine but the earphones fell out with the slightest knock. 
I removed some lint with a needle; now it fits but sound isn't right. It's distorted, sometimes all treble, etc. Sound is fine if I pull the earphone plug out a little bit (to the depth at which it used only be able to go) but fall out at the slightest knock.
Could there be any other reason other than lint causing this? And if so, how can I troubleshoot and resolve the problem(s)?

A: Sounds like you need to do more cleaning.
Do not use metallic objects like needle.
Use toothpick.
Also use a ear-swab (with some alcohol).
Then see if you can get the sprig out in the proper position. 
It is probably stuck. That's the piece that holds the plug in place. 
You should see it when you look inside with flashlight and magnifier.

A: I cannot help you to figure out the issue since i am unsure but i do believe Apple may replace your device for you, they are generally pretty good in that regard. Give it a shot.
