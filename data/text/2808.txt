Q: What can I use to enable-disable a ssh tunnel with port forwarding? I already found a product that does this, named Meerkat, but I'm looking for a free solution.
I need to do several port remapping with ease.

A: Aliases and a bash script? Or the following:


*

*SSH Tunnel Manager (free, open source)

*Cocoa-SSHTunnel (GPL)

*SSH Keychain (GPL)


A: I've had pretty good success with SSH Tunnel Manager. It's now available on the Mac App Store. I have some clients who use it to tunnel FileMaker Pro across the internet.
