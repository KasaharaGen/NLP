Q: How do I gain permission to generate ssh keys on my Mac? I tried to generate ssh keys for GitHub (access through SSH in terminal), but I do not have access to the .ssh directory.
I tried to ls -l ~/.ssh, but I got this error ls: .ssh: Permission denied
I tried to read on the internet tuns of tutorials and tips for fix it, but unfortunately nothing works me.
What am I doing incorrectly and how can I fix it? I am running on Mac os X 10.6

A: chown -R YOUR_USER: ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*


A: sounds like you don't have eXecute permission on your .ssh folder: try running ls -ld ~/.ssh and verify that the permissions are drwx------, and that the directory is owned by you. If the permissions differ, run chmod -R u+rwX,go-rwx ~/.ssh; if you're not the owner, run chown -R <your account name> ~/.ssh (find out your account name by running whoami). 
If either the chmod or chown commands fail due to permission errors, run them again but prefic them with sudo.

A: Run
man chown
man chmod

and read how to change the ownership and permissions for the directory.

A: Go into Terminal and type in:
chmod a+rwx ~/.ssh

And generate your keys.
Once you're done generating your keys, relock your .ssh directory by doing:
chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh    
chmod u+rwx ~/.ssh

The first command removes permissions from "group" and "others" and the second is probably not necessary, but it explicitly sets your own rwx bits.
I'd expect the reason the .ssh directory would be locked to "others" and "groups" would be to keep malicious apps & processes from sniffing out any keys that live in that directory.
