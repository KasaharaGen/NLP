Q: How do I keep my MBP's screen on? I have an early 2011 MBP running Lion. Is there a way to let screen not switch off  i.e, a keep screen on software? I heard several recommendations of a application named coffee for Mac but I can't find it anywhere.

A: As the commenter said, Caffeine is what you want.
