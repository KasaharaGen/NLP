Q: How can AirDrop be disabled? I want to disable AirDrop so that my users do not have access to it but I have not been able to find a place to disable this feature.
The closest thing i have found is this thread but I don't know where to disable it.
Could someone explain to me how to do this?

A: System-wide
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES

User-specific (via preferences)
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES
