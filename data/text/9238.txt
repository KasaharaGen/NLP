Q: Do I have to explicitly update iTunes Match after adding new tracks to my Library? Yesterday I set up iTunes Match, and before the day was over it Matched and/or Uploaded all of the tracks in my library at the time. Just now I added a few more tracks and they're currently listed as 'Waiting'.
Will iTunes Match eventually act on these new tracks automatically? Or will I have to explicitly go into the Store menu and choose 'Update iTunes Match'?

A: Choose "Update iTunes Match" from the "Store" menu.
