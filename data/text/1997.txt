Q: why does itunes "optimize" my photos every time i sync Every time I sync my ipod touch, I sit there and watch "optimizing photos x of 1000" which takes forever. 
To be clear, I am not adding any more photos.  Shouldn't this only be a one time thing to optimize photos?
Why does it need to do this step every time?

A: I not sure why it does it every time, but the 'optimising' is basically shrinking their dimensions to the iPod screen size, thus saving space on the iPod.
I would therefore assume that it does it every time as it doesn't save the 'optimised' ones in order to save space on the computer.

A: Is this on a windows computer or a Mac OS computer?
Check properties in itunes for options related to photos.
If you're on Mac OS check the iPhoto program for similar "ipod" options.
