Q: Site Blocker for Mobile Safari Google Searches Is there a way to block content scraper sites from Google searches on Mobile Safari?  I would like something like the "Personal Blocklist" now available for Google Chrome.  

A: Mobile Safari does not support browser extensions, which is what powers the block list.
We may see something in the future, but you're out of luck until then.
