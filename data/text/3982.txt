Q: iPhone 3g with IOS 4.2.1 cycles wifi, cannot connect I'm trying to fix the WiFi on my friends iPhone 3g. It sees all the networks, but I only get "Unable to join network " when I try to connect. So I jailbroke it ;) and installed WiFiFoFum just to see if I could get some more details. And it seems like the phone cycles the wifi drivers or something.
When WiFiFoFum scans the networks, they show up in a list. It does this once every ~3 seconds (it shows a loader when it does). But every 3 or 4 scans, all networks disappear, stay away for about 3 or 4 scans, then pop in again.
Of cource this could be a flaw with WiFiFoFum, but it's very coincidental in that case...
Any suggestions? I'm planning on going in with SSH to see if I can figure out closer what is happening. Should I look for anything special?
EDIT:
Some more info.. I have tried unsecured, wep, wpa and wpa2 protected networks, no difference.

A: Eliminate the possibility of a software problem by (first backing up and then) restoring to a clean default OS install. It you still can't connect in that state, it's time for a visit to the Genius Bar or a call to AppleCare.

A: Try to reset all settings this usually works for me!
