Q: Recommendations for video editing + screen capturing software I'd like to make a video demo of my upcoming web application. Requirements include:


*

*Being able to have a sound track (probably just an mp3)

*Being able to 'film' screen work and chop it to bits and pieces to be embedded in the movie

*Having text, photo effects, fade in-out, constant motion (similar to mac screen saver slide show) etc - nothing too fancy.

*"Timeline" editor where I can combine all those elements and time them perfectly

*HD output with formats I can export later to Vimeo or YouTube.


I you have recommendations to video editing/video screen capturing i'd be happy to hear those. I've never done that before, but I do have lots of graphics experience and a good eye. Should be an interesting attempt.

A: Try ScreenFlow ($99)
It's a little pricey, but very powerful screen capture utility. You can do the effects/transitions inside, or export and edit it Final Cut or iMovie.
This is an example clip I did a while ago with ScreenFlow and Final Cut.
