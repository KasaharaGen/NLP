Q: NTFS-3G cpu usage my ntfs-3g application takes up to 20% of my cpu usage. I don't know any way to reduce it so I have to kill it's proceess. Any idea about fixing this?

A: I'd consider configuring spotlight not to index or monitor your NTFS partition.


*

*Open 'System Preferences'

*Spotlight

*Click the 'Privacy' tab

*Click the + and select your NTFS partition


If that doesn't work you might consider defragmenting the NTFS partition, disabling transparent compression, or updating to a newer version of NTFS-3G.
For more information Tuxera has a decent FAQ related to performance problems with NTFS-3G.
