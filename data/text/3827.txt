Q: Checkers Game on Mac 10.4.11 I need to install Checkers game on my Mac 10.4.11 for my HCI project. Does anyone know a free download link?
tnx

A: There's not much out there!  Those that are work on 10.5 and 10.6 but not 10.4
This one is $4.99 and works on 10.4
Might be your only hope.

A: Big Bang Checkers from Freeverse works on Tiger (or used to). It comes with a package with other games but it costs 25$ (a little bit too much given that you were looking for a free link).
You can find more information about it at MacUpdate's page for BigBang: 

Big Bang Board Games... It's Sun vs. Moon in these innovative takes on great classic games. Play Checkers, Chess, Reversi, Mancala, Backgammon, 4-in-a-Row and Tic-Tac-Toe against the animated computer opponents, via email with friends, or online with new friends from around the globe!

In their requirements site it says: 

REQUIREMENTS
  PPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.3 or later.

Since I have it, let me show you a sshot:

Note: Freeverse seem to be having a MySQL problem in their website at this time

A: I found a 1.99 checkers game in the mac app store named aptly, checkers.
Also, have you considered just playing it online? There might be some flash based checkers games you could download and run locally.
