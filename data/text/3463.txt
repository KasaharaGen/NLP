Q: Using a dropdown menu with arrow keys in Photoshop This may be a tad specific but it's one thing that irks me with OS X.
In Photoshop, if I want to change a layer style from 'Normal' to say 'Overlay', I need to click the dropdown list and select 'Overlay'. If I then wanted to change this again, I can't just use the keyboard buttons to scroll up or down the list - I need to go in using the mouse again and it's a bit of a pain.
Scrolling with the arrow keys works fine on other drop down lists like fonts etc.
Any ideas?

A: I am not sure if you can do this with the arrow keys but there are shortcut keys for navigating the layers box
Changing layer styles

(with layer selected) hold down ⌥ + ⇧ (option & shift) and use the + or - keys to cycle through the various layer dropdown  

Navigation of layers

UP  ⌥ + ] 
DOWN ⌥ + [

Repositioning a selected layer

(with layer selected) Move up a layer 
  with ⌘ + ]
(with layer selected) Move down a
  layer with  ⌘ + [

these work for me with the CS5 version of photoshop
