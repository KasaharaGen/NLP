Q: How can I find the size of multiple folders? When I highlight several folders in Finder and do a get info, I get an info window for each folder.  Is there a way to get a single window showing size of all folders highlighted?

A: There are 3 forms of "Get Info":
1) Standard "Get Info" achieved through Command+i which can potentially create multiple windows for each item selected.
2) "Get Summary Info" achieved through Command+Control+i which uses a single window to show combined info about the selection:
 
3) "Inspector", like @iskra mentioned, achieved through Command+Option+i, which is similar to 2) except that it updates the info dynamically based on your selection.


A: Open a finder window and set the view to list view.
Press command-J and select "calculate all sizes" then click "use as standard".
Now folder sizes will show in your finder.
I don't think it is possible to show sizes for multiple folders, but this might be a good workaround.

A: cmd+alt/option+i will give you info on multiple highlighed items.

A: Alternatively

*

*open Terminal.app

*cd to the directory 'above' the ones you need the size for

*du -sh FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in "human readable" format (Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte
and Petabyte.)

*du -sm FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in megabytes

*du -sg FOLDER1 FOLDER2 gives sizes in Gigabytes
