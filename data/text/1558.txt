Q: How to fix links after importing a PPT onto iPad's Keynote? After I transferred my Power Point presentations onto my new iPad, into Keynote, I notice a problem. The links associated with buttons within a Power Point slide to connect to other slides in the presentation are no longer working, but everything else is? 
Is there an easy fix?

A: Keynote for iPad doesn't support links inside the presentation itself (per Apple's Keynote for iPad FAQ). Or at least it doesn't currently; KN/iPad is already a lot better than it was when it first shipped.
