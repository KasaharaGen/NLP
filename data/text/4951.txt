Q: How to convert mov to swf? I have a QuickTime .mov file which I want to convert to swf format. Is there any tool for Mac? I already search here for a similar question but couldn't find any. The google search directed me to VisualHub which was discontinued and doesn't support Snow Leopard. 
Is there a method using an Adobe CS5 app? If not what are the free solutions out there?
TIA  

A: Never mind. I found an answer on Adobe website. For those who are interested, here is the link.

That's just a simple google search.
You can also use compressor to encode to h.264 and then change the file extension to .flv
