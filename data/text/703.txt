Q: How to find songs on iPod I recently downloaded a YouTube playlist, ripped the audio, and added it to my iPod/iTunes library. Currently the songs are in my "Recently Added" playlist, but once they disappear from there, I don't know I'll find them.
I've checked if the name of the playlist (also the name of the directory the files are stored in) is being used as either the album name or artist name, and it's not.

A: Choose the track in iTunes and choose get info (cmd-I)
The summary tab gives a description of the track including album, artist etc and the full path in the filesystem
The info tab gives the details of the album, artist, album artist ie what artist appears in the iTunes listing
The sorting tab might also be of interest for this issue
These artist and albums will also be the ones used on the iPod
Also you can change the recently added playlist to include more tracks by changing the number in the definition of the smart playlist

A: Your best bet is to create a Smart Playlist called “Recently Added” (or similar) with the following rules (adjust to your likings):

note: the “media is not podcast” is my own thing, you can remove that, but it’s pretty straightforward.
