Q: MobileMe calendar invite emails are missing Accept/Decline buttons I've got a weird problem that is almost certainly a configuration issue. I send calendar requests to 3 people via MobileMe (for shared calendaring), and 2 of the people receive Accept/Decline buttons in their HTML emails (and also an ICS file), but one does not. 
I've checked all sorts of settings, but I can't figure out why he doesn't get the Accept/Decline buttons or ICS attachments when the others do!
Any ideas?
