Q: How to remove one old python installation from a system with multiple (non-system) installations of python Disclaimer
First, let me get the obvious out of the way: I have not touched the system-bundled Python.  I know it’s important to leave it alone.  I have, in fact, done exactly that. ☺ 

Background
The Python official releases for Mac have a very handy Installer.  (It’s the Installer’s brilliance that allowed me to put newer versions of Python on my system without screwing up the system-bundled version.  Thanks, Pythonistas!)  
Now, my primary Python installation is 2.7.  Since it is the last 2.x release, that’s fine.
However, I was curious to learn about Python 3 as well, so I installed it.  And it plays perfectly nicely with Python 2.  In fact, Python 3 is opt-in, which is just what I wanted.  “Works as advertised.”
Now, the weird part…
I have 2 installed versions of Python 3!  The installers for Python 3.1 and Python 3.2 both installed to separate locations.  So, now I have Python 3.1 hanging around and I’m never planning to use it.  And since the installer is awesome (I’m not being sarcastic; I’m really impressed, especially since most programming languages require compilation from source), it also creates entries in /Applications with some handy utilities.  
But since I have installed a newer Python 2 and two versions of Python 3, this means I now have:


*

*/Applications/Python 2.7,

*/Applications/Python 3.1, and 

*/Applications/Python 3.2
Help Wanted!
I just want to ditch Python 3.1.  
And I want to be very thorough about it.  No forgotten directories buried under /Library/* (or whatever).  
Anybody know how to do this?

A: From python docs noting that they seem to have hard coded 2.5 instead of the current version and is not that well written

What you get after installing is a number of things:


A MacPython 2.5 folder in your Applications folder. In here you find
IDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of official
Python distributions; PythonLauncher, which handles double-clicking
Python scripts from the Finder; and the “Build Applet” tool, which
allows you to package Python scripts as standalone applications on
your system.


A framework /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, which
includes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this
location to your shell path. To uninstall MacPython, you can simply
remove these three things. A symlink to the Python executable is
placed in /usr/local/bin/.

so remove
/Applications/Python 3.1
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1
/usr/local/bin/python31 

(I use a different install so this might be python3.1 or similar)
