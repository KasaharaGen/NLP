Q: Is there a way to have the iPhone suggest corrections but not automatically apply them? The iPhone's autocorrect function is wrong for me more often than not, but I'd still like to see its suggestions and have a way to apply them - they just shouldn't be applied automatically. Is there a way to do this?

A: In a nutshell: No (but it would be nice to have)
