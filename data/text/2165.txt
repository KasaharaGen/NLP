Q: Can I control the music player on my iPhone from a PC? Is there any app (or otherwise) that allows me to select audio tracks to play, or even just skip to the next track on my iPhone 4 via a PC connected to the iPhone by USB?

A: Bowtie should solve your problem. It's a free desktop app that talks to a .99 cent app that you download on the iPhone:
