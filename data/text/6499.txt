Q: Keyboard Key Mapping I run a MacBook Pro 15", Wireless Bluetooth Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse. 
Everything for the last year has been working great. Just recently I FINALLY had to change my batteries in my keyboard. Upon doing so, a bunch of my key combinations from the wireless keyboard no longer work. For example: 


*

*In IntelliJ I can press ALT + F7 to perform a certain function. This no longer works. 

*In PhotoShop I used to be able to press CMD + ALT + SHIFT + S to get "save for web", this no longer works. 


The basic keyboard functionality (typing/etc) works fine, its just certain key combos that do not work. If I type these EXACT same combos into the built in keyboard on my MacBook Pro, everything works fine. 
How do I get my key mappings/settings to match that of my MacBook Pro keyboard? What changed and why? 

A: Ok, here's the deal: Keyboard is broken. Both ALT keys are broke. 
Took the keyboard into the Genius bar and they verified that the keys were broken. Got a new one as it was still under warranty.
