Q: OSX Second monitor/display background Is it possible to change the display default image on a second display connected to an Apple running OSX 10.6. ? I can see all the display options for the desktop, but the 2nd display has the Apple Desktop picture 'Apple/Nature/Aurora as a default.  The only way I can find of changing this is to select mirroring on displays and then choose an alternative, which will display on both screens.  Turn mirroring off then 'Aurora' returns, but the desktop will reflect the new change.
kind regards
Ric

A: @Rick - With Mirroring turned off, when you open System Preferences and click Desktop & Screen Saver, you should see a window open in each display that allows you to select a distinct background image for each display.
