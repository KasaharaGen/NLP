Q: With multiple monitors, can I pick which one an application will load on? In Spaces it's possible to specify which space a given application will open on -- for example, my web browser always opens on Space 1 and iTunes on Space 3.  Is something similar possible with multiple monitors, so that whichever space I'm on a certain application will always open on the second monitor?  For even more control, can I specify that it will always open on Monitor 2 of Space 4?

A: Not with the default Apple Spaces.
There is an alternative, though. CocoaBots makes a small app called Hyperspaces which builds upon the default Spaces and adds a bunch of cool features. Multi-monitor support is coming to their next release.
