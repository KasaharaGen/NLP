Q: Equalizing volume of different songs in itunes I have enabled the option to equalize volume but it doesn't seem to do anything. Neither does it work for itunes, nor for the songs on my ipod. Is there some option/setting I am overlooking?

A: I use an external tool (MP3gain) for this. It works fine without touching the mp3 coding. The linked one is windows only, but there is also a Mac version, if I remember correctly.
