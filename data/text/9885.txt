Q: 10.7 Launchd + rvm This question fits somewhere between server fault, stackoverflow and askdifferent. 
I am installing some web apps on my Lion server using webappctl, which hooks into apaches vhost configs to setup up a reverse proxy (simply mod_proxy). It uses launchd to start the server, in my case unicorn serving a Ruby on Rails app, listening on TCP port 5000. I use RVM (mixed-mode) to facilitate in separate ruby versions and gemsets for each webapp.
The problem lies with RVM and launchd, and the complete environment not being available for launchd.
I tried to start from launchd using /bin/bash -l -c 'unicorn_rails -l 5000' but that gave me bash usage errors in the logs. 
Any suggestions for making RVM play nice with launchd?

A: I found a way to make a RVM-based rake command work with launchd:
/bin/bash -l -c '/absolute/path/to/myscript.sh'

My script was calling rake. I wasn't calling it directly.
Have you tried using an absolute path for your unicorn_rails?
