Q: Keyboard shortcuts with Dvorak keymapping In the Dvorak key layout, Spotlight's shortcut masks the Undo shortcut, and I couldn't fix the problem by changing or disabling shortcut associations. Any advice?

A: You could try using "Dvorak - Qwerty âŒ˜" instead of straight Dvorak.  It uses the Dvorak layout for regular typing, but keeps the Cmd shortcuts the same as what's printed on your keyboard.
