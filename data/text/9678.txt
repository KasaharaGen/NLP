Q: Locked out of Mac OS X Lion, but keyboard and mouse are not connecting I'm at the lock screen of Mac OS X Lion (not login, but the quick lock screen), and I know my password, but the keyboard and mouse are not connecting.  I am using an iMac that did have Bluetooth on the last time I was working on it.  I know that restarting the computer will probably help, but I have unsaved work on Xcode 4!  Thanks in advance.
Edit: it seems that Bluetooth is off for some reason on the Mac, as I cannot find it in a list of discoverable devices on my iPod.  Is there a way to restart Bluetooth from a USB device?  I was wondering if hooking up my iPod would help, but the Mac is locked and won't do anything!  If I could click the Switch User button...

A: Try to remove the batteries and then put then back.
If not then try USB Keyboard or Remote Desktop/VNC
