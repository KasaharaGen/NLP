Q: Is there a way to remove the artist name from a large number of titles in itunes? I have a few hundred mp3's which are labeled, e.g., "Rush - 01 - actual title of song". Is there a way to automatically remove "Rush - XX - " form the title names?

A: Try Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes . I think This one does it if not there will be something similar

A: On the payware  (but excellent) side, you have Song Genie which will do all that for you. 

A: MusicBrainz Picard can do file renaming and/or moving as it tags.

A: if you want pay some you can use Tune UP it's also compatible with iTunes.
and other choice for you is to use jaikoz.

A: A Better Finder Rename is a commercial product (US $20) that can, among many other features, batch-modify ID3 tags in your iTunes files. You can download a trial version and try it on a few files.

A: Another option might have been to use TriTag to assign new titles based on the names of the files.
Or run a temporary script like this in AppleScript Editor:
tell application "iTunes"
    repeat with t in selection
        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to " - "
        set name of t to text item 3 of (get name of t)
    end repeat
end tell
