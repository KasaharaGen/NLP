Q: Does Skype work for the Guest login? Skype works fine when I launch it on my Login.  When I switch to the Guest login, though, Skype launches but does not connect after 90 seconds.  Does it eventually connect if I give it more time, or is there some architectural obstacle that prevents using it as Guest?

A: You say that you 'switch' to the Guest login. Are you using fast user switching and leaving Skype running on your other account? It may not be a problem with the Guest account, but with trying to run multiple instances of Skype on the same machine.
