Q: How to monitor USB power consumption? I'm looking for a way to monitor the power being drawn from the USB ports on my Mac.
System Profiler doesn't appear to display this and I haven't been able to find any applications or tools to do the job either.
Can anyone suggest anything (preferably software based)?

A: USB power consumption information should be available in System Profiler.  See the screenshot below:


A: There is an application that is part of the Developer Tools on your Mac called USB Prober. It should provide you with the details that you need. 
It can be found by signing up (free) for a Mac Developer Account and downloading the latest Xcode tools at http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
After installation the application you are looking for is found in /Developer/Applications/Utilities.
Hope that helps.

A: iStat Menus keeps track of pretty much all sensors in a Mac. On my Macbook Pro there is the "Other 5V" sensor which apparently includes the USB ports. It is not very detailed / precise but at least I can tell if devices are plugged in or active. Here is my backup USB disk working and sleeping for a few minutes now:


A: As determining the current power consumption for a specific USB port on a Mac seems not be possible software-wise, as the solutions https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13874/11510 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13875/11510 show, you could get an approximation with the following method:


*

*Have your system as idle as possible.﹡

*Check your systems power consumption without the device.

*Attach your device.

*Check your systems power consumption with the device.

*The difference is the approximated device power consumption.



﹡Get your system as idle as possible, with as little power fluctuations as possible:


*

*Boot complete, all startup scripts ran

*Backup daemons likely done their thing (i.e software updaters), Spotlight indexing done,…

*Offline

*No foreground app is running, except the monitoring app of your choice, which in itself should also be quite stable if it polls regularly.
