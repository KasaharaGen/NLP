Q: How do I make symbolic links invisible in the Finder? I use SetFile via the terminal to render files and folders invisible inside Finder windows. This does not appear to work on symbolic links: the symlink destination is made invisible, rather than the symlink itself.
I see a number of symlinks in / which are invisible in the Finder (e.g. /etc -> private/etc), so it seems to be possible. Can I duplicate this behavior?

A: Reading fail.
-P                                # perform action on symlink instead of following it

This flag has strange indenting in SetFile -h, and I must have just ignored it assuming it was related to the -m date flag.
So,
SetFile -P -a V my_symlink


A: To hide:
chflags -h hidden <symlink>

To show again:
chflags -h nohidden <symlink>


A: If you use ln -s source_file target_file from a terminal you'll get e.g. /etc -> private/etc shown in the ls -la - but only shown the target_file in the folder.
