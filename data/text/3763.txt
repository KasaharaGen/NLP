Q: Include original picture's file on a iPhoto slideshow There is a simple way to include the original picture's file of a iPhoto slideshow?
I create a slideshow with iPhoto, select Share and iDvd. Now I have the slideshow on iDvd and I can burn or export in VIDEO_TS or .IMG. What is the best way to have the burned dvd video with the original picture's file inside too?

A: In iDVD, in the Advanced Menu, there is an option to Edit DVD-ROM contents.  There you can simply add whatever content you want, including dragging in the photos from iPhoto.
