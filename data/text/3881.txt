Q: Is there any way to change the output filename for qlmanage? Is there any way to specify the output filename and directory that qlmanage uses?
We are using qlmanage to convert word documents to HTML, and it writes Preview.html to its temp directory.  You can specify the output directory with -o, so right now we create a new directory for each file we write, which works fine, but... not optimal.  
No mention of such a facility in the command line options, but i thought i'd ask in case there is some undocumented trick.
thanks,
ian.

A: You can use textutil to convert Word documents to HTML and specify the output filename; it uses a different converter, though, which may not be acceptable for your uses.
With regard to qlmanage, you're abusing Quick Look here already.  The output is a directory, not a file, which is only designed for Quick Look to consume.  That Preview.html is a fixed filename is by design; otherwise the Quick Look displayer wouldn't know where to start.  That you're able to extract the HTML output yourself is a nice side effect, nothing more.
