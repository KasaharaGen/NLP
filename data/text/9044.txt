Q: How do I keep the new line/line break/end of line in a file consistent across mac and windows I use DropBox on both a windows and a mac.
Whenever I add lines to a .txt file on my mac and sync it with DropBox to my windows, the "new lines" are skrewed up when reading the file on my windows, and vice verse.
My mac insists to use it own form of new lines even so that the file was created with a different type of new lines. The end result is a file with mixed new line types.
I know that new lines are different on windows and mac os x (and on linux for that matter) and I know that this is the problem.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline
I would expect textedit in OS X to detect the type of new line used and stick with it.
Is there anyway that I can accomplish that ?

A: Which editors and viewers do you use?
This topic describes how to set newline in BBedit and Textmate. Also you can use TextWrangler and Notepad++ which are freeware
PS: I commonly use Vim in Windows and Mac (MacVim). In this editor I do ":set fileformat=dos" to convert to CR-LF
