Q: iPod Touch /w iOS4 - Why do I have to have iTunes installed to charge? Do I have to have iTunes running to charge my iPod Touch?  I mean, can't I just turn on my computer and have the USB port just charge the silly thing?  All my other devices work like that; why does Apple have to be such a prima-donna?

A: You pretty much self-answered the question but, in any case and for future reference:
You donâ€™t need iTunes to charge iPhones/Pads/Pods. iPhones come with a wall-pluggable charger that also happens to charge the other members of the family.
