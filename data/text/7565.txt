Q: Decent LAN/Internet games for Mac Since the decommission of Halo Demo for Mac, I have had no decent LAN/Internet games to play with my Mac. 
Does anyone have any recommendations? 
I like First Person Shooters and Third Person Shooters the best, if you can think of any of those. They must be free.
