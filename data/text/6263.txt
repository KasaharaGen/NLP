Q: How to fix “swipe up” and “swipe down” gestures in Reeder after installing Lion? After upgrading to Lion, Reeder swipe up and swipe down gestures stopped working.

How do I fix them?

A: This problem is a known issue and has been fixed in recent versions.     
However, it is not specific to Reeder and seems to also affect Twitter and other apps.  
To work around it, hold ⌥ Option and swipe using the same count of fingers that you have set for Mission Control in Trackpad preference pane:


A: You can fix this (temporarily), but there's some plist hacking involved. I read on reeder's twitter feed about a solution to this problem. 

“@jagreenwood: @reederapp i got them working like this tumblr.com/xic3melm6o swipeWithEvent isn't called otherwise”
  Great, thanks!

The solution described at the linked address explains how to fix this problem in a couple of steps:


*

*I set up the trackpad properties in Preferences like this:


*open up ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist in your favorite editor 

*make set the value of key TrackpadThreeFingerVertSwipeGesture to 1

*Restart your computer as this setting otherwise isn't used.


It's a bit hackish, but works pretty fine for me. The author of the post has also a different solution, but I don't really like that there's the option key involved.
