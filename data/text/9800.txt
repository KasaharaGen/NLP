Q: opendirectoryd taking up 1/4 of the cpu and driving fans crazy on MacBook Air Since a couple of days my 2011 13" MBA (i5, 1,7Ghz) has a very strange issue which I don't know how to get rid of.
Every now and then (sometimes more times a day) a process called opendirectoryd takes up 99-101% of my CPUs. This causes the temperature to go up and after a short while the fans kick in. My MBA is logged in as part of an Active Directory Domain.
First I tried waiting a couple of minutes, but the process didn't stop. Rebooting the machine seems to always fix the problem, but that's not exactly my preferred solution for this problem.
For now I stick to force kill the process. I need to repeat this 1-2 times per iteration and then there's a undefined period of time in which I'm safe. 
I'm not sure if it is related to the 10.7.2 update or to something else.
I found others having a similar problem. In that case it seems to be related to a Livescribe pen. While I have a Livescribe pen (updated to the latest version of the client software) I don't have any suspicious entries in Console.app. 
Any help would be appreciated.

As mentioned by @juanpablo, this may be caused by symlinks.
Apparently, if a symlink points to /home, autofs or automountd fire and take a lot of CPU to figure out that the place indeed doesn't exist.
Take a look at /etc/auto_home and /etc/autofs.conf.
To see if you're being hit by this particular problem, set
AUTOMOUNTD_VERBOSE=TRUE

option in autofs.conf, restart automountd
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.automountd

and review the syslog.log (you may use application: Console). You're affected by this problem if you see something like that:
May 20 17:53:43 xxx automountd[31709]: od_search failed

To workaround, edit the file /etc/auto_master and remove (or hash out #) the line starting with /home. Then run:
sudo automount -vc


A: First thing first, kill -9 <pid> of opendirectoryd probably won't prevent your problem from recurring at next boot up. My guess is your Mac is a managed client (MCX) that need to sync. opendirectoryd in OS X 10.7 requires a local directory node to have a "users" and a "groups" subdirectory. Try flushing your cache settings as described in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3540 

A: My issue to high CPU utilization of opendirectoryd was that some robot on the Internet was trying different passwords to break into my computer via ssh.  At least, that's what I think this meant:
8/25/15 12:20:51.173 PM sshd[66230]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 222.186.21.218 via 192.168.0.3
8/25/15 12:20:51.189 PM sshd[66191]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 222.186.56.168 via 192.168.0.3
8/25/15 12:20:51.214 PM sshd[66205]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 222.186.21.251 via 192.168.0.3

The moment I turned off SSH (by unchecking System Preferences->Sharing->Remote Login,) opendirectoryd utilization disappeared.  I figure high utilization was from my computer trying to respond to those bad password requests.
We just got a new router.  It obviously isn't configured to stop multiple attacks like this.  Off to look at the router.

A: I have the same problem but until then I have difficulty solving it.
I do not manage to understand better the solutions which you propose. Procedures are not self explanatory for new mac users
I will cover more details on the new OS having this same symptom on this question

*Opendirectoryd uses up to 85% CPU. My mac heats up at a high temperature

A: I've also seen this problem when using MAMP, where the php code is generating warning messages, either on the screen, or the logs.
After the execution of the script finishes, the service settles down again.
