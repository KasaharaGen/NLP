Q: Recommend me a productivity/workflow tool Can anyone recommend me a productivity/workflow tool that does the following?


*

*I would like it to be task based

*I would like to be able to set:


*

*a due-date

*priority

*status (for example: started, paused, waiting for input, finished, cancelled)


*I would like to be able to link directly to one or several emails in my email program (OS X Mail.app or Thunderbird preferred)

*I would like to write notes about each task

*I would like to be able to add attachments (documents and images)

*Some calendar integration would be nice 


A: I think you're looking for OmniFocus, which does (if I recall) everything you want, has a system-wide modal "inbox" tool as well as synchronizable iPad and iPhone apps.
Their price point is ridiculously high in my opinion, but people are fanatical about it.

A: I believe Things does all that. I use it. I like it. 
I don’t know about thunderbird “linking” but with Mail.app it works. You can “drag” a mail onto a task or things to create a new one. Same with documents. 

A: The Hit List also does all this. I'm currently using it. It offers sub-tasks and sub-folders so it is more inline with OmniOutlier than Things (which does not offer sub-folders).
It's currently in Beta, which is nice because it's free.

A: Maybe you want to take a look at Process (Manual in PDF). It’s cheaper than Things and OmniFocus.
note: I’m adding this 2nd answer so people can vote at their discretion. 

A: Judging by your description, you might like Kanban Tool (https://kanbantool.com/). It is task-based, you can add due dates, set priorities and change the status of the task. You can add attachments. It also has a time tracking feature (I personally find it very helpful) and is easy to use. There's a free trial, so you can always test it and see for yourself whether you like it or not.
