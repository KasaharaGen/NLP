Which new Mac purchasers get free upgrades to 10.7? 

I'm due for a free update to Mac OS X Lion, as I bought an iMac in July after the cut-off date for free updates.
When I go to claim the free update on the apple web site, it asks me to enter the serial numbers of all "qualifying macs". If I just enter the number of the Mac that I bought most recently, will I be able to install Lion on the other ones manually? I assume so, but I don't want to accidentally short myself $30 :)

A: The download of Lion, like any other App on the Mac App Store is subject to the same licensing counts as any other app. You are able to have 5 simultaneous copies of the App just like you can authorize 5 machines to hold your iTunes purchased content.
