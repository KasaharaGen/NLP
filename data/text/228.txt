Q: What's the best server/client combo to remote into your Mac (10.6) from a windows machine? I have a Mac OS X 10.6 computer at home, which I like to remote into from my work laptop from time to time. I've tried using RealVNC and UltraVNC with the built-in VNC client, but I can't get them to accept the adaptive compression, so I can either do 


*

*8-bit color that is low bandwidth 

*Full color that takes up too much bandwidth for my home's upload speed


Is there a VNC client that supports the adaptive compression on the built-in vnc server for Mac OS X? Some other things I have tried are


*

*Using custom VNC server (Vine Server) to get higher color with acceptable bandwith

*Logmein.com - which seems to have it's own adaptive compression, but is only free for use w/one computer


A: You could try TeamViewer. 
Like Logmein.com, it is a full software and one based one Mac OS X vnc.
By the way, it also works from an iPad or an iPhone or from a web browser under Windows.

A: perhaps see what http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/ can do for you? i'm running it to share out a single monitor out of three, to vnc clients on other platforms that don't support apple's monitor selection extensions or whatever it's called to make that work in mac-to-mac Screen Sharing.

A: Here's one I haven't tried, but Leo Laporte loves: GoToMyPC.
If you're going to try it, be sure to get a discount coupon somewhere.
And here's a good place to look for alternatives.

A: Here is the software we use in our company (Windows): Radmin
Highly recommend. Not sure they have MAC version but my colleagues say they used it on MAC.
