Q: Drag and drop items as attachment in Entourage I find it little tedious to drop items in new email and make it an attachment. I need to resize both, source and destination window, so that I can pick and drop the item. This takes time. Yes few seconds more, but it matters.
Is it possible to drag an item from source window and then press command+~ (or command+tab) to chose a destination window and then drop it there? Any other easier solution available?

A: For most Macintosh applications that accept drag and drop, you can drag and drop files to their Dock icon. So your "flow" might be:


*

*Open the finder window with the file you want to send

*Drag it to your dock

*Drop it on the Entourage icon

*Entourage will launch and should give you a new message, with that file attached


Hope this helps.

A: You can also begin your drag in the Finder (or your source), trigger Exposé, then drag the file onto the (shrunken) destination window. The window will flash a few times, and then Exposé will close with the destination window frontmost so you can drop your file.
