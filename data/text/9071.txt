Q: Is there a Subversion 1.7 GUI Client for OSX Lion? We are looking for a Subversion client for OSX Lion that support version 1.7, but we cannot find one. 
Is there "an app for that"? :-)

A: Cornerstone just updated to 1.7 on Feb. 10th http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/index.php

A: You can configure svnX (free client) to use SVN 1.7 by changing "path to SVN binaries" in Preferences to your SVN 1.7 install path.

A: There is SmartSVN (not free). In latest version they've fixed some Subversion 1.7 related bugs.

A: Versions is a very nice one. Also see this question on Stackoverflow.
