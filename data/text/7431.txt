Q: What are the keyboard shortcuts for copying login and password in 1Password without using the browser extension? I am using 1Password (version 3.8.5) to manage my login data and somehow I am reluctant to use the browser extensions. I want to speed up my login and password acquisition though and therefore I am searching for keyboard shortcuts to:


*

*Copy a password

*Copy a login


The keyboard shortcuts for getting to the login I have searched for or for tabbing to the correct item in the UI is something I am already familiar with.

A: There are not specific keyboard shortcuts for those two individual items in 1Password but you can navigate to them with the keyboard.
Here's how you could get a login or password into your clipboard without pushing a mouse (or fondling a trackpad). 


*

*Command-F to search for the account you want to access

*↑ / ↓ to move up or down through the search results

*Command-E to switch to edit mode for the selected record

*Tab until you get to the field you want to copy

*Command-C to copy the value from the field

*Command-E again to exit edit mode


You now have the value you want on your clipboard. 
I know it's not the single shortcut you were looking for but I think it's as close as you're going to get with 1Password. 

A: Was just searching for the exact same thing and it looks as though 1Password has had this function recently added as I found this post:

Option+Command+c will copy the currently selected password. Just tried it on my copy and it works great.
