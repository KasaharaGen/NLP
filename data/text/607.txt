Q: Does performance degrade between iOS 3.1 and 4.1 for the iPod Touch 2nd gen? I noticed a considerable performance degradation when updating to iOS 4.0; enough to downgrade back to 3.1.x. Has that issue been completely resolved in 4.1? Having to downgrade again would be a pain.

A: I've made the updates, and I didn't notice anything about a performance degradation. 

A: I've finally gotten around to trying the 4.1 upgrade, and the responsiveness seems perfectly acceptable now.
