Q: Some items missing from my iTunes Purchase History I purchased some audio books and movies on the iTunes store before  (2-3 years ago).
But when I use the new iPhone 4S to look at my account, the "Purchased" show 1 audio book but doesn't show the other one I can clearly remember (in fact, I purchased that audio book twice, hoping the second time won't be any charge, but there was).
Also missing are some movies, such as Toy Story...  Is the only thing I can do to contact Apple iTunes Store Customer Service to resolve this?

A: ok, the best way I found, is to use the Express Lane.  Just google for: Apple Express Lane and you will find it.

A: As far as I know - movies are not yet available via the iTunes "Purchased" tab for re-download.  Only TV series are so far.  I think Apple is still negotiating the rights to allow movie downloads multiple times after purchase.
