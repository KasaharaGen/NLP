Q: How can I use iMac internet in my iPod touch? I don't have a Wi-Fi connection here. Is there a way to connect to the internet from my iMac with my iPod touch?

A: Yes !
You can share you internet connection via Wi-Fi in the "Sharing" preference pane of System preferences. Once activated, your iPod touch will detect a Wi-Fi network that you can join to share the internet connection of your iMac.
(if you're on Lion, replace "Airport" by "Wi-Fi")


*

*Open System preferences

*Click on "Sharing"

*Click on "Internet sharing" (but don't check the checkbox yet)

*Select "Ethernet" in the dropdown menu "Share your connection from"

*Check "Airport" in the list "via"

*Click "Airport options" to configure wireless network security

*Check the checkbox in front of "Internet sharing" in the list on the left to activate it.

*If Airport is turned off, it'll ask you if it can turn it on, say yes.

*Connect to the created network with you iPod touch as you would do for any wireless network.
