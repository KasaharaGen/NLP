Q: Chax with Lion: downgrading iChat to 5.0.3? I wonder if this could allow us to have Chax functionality on Lion.
I've got iChat 5.0.3 from a Snow Leopard install: the next step would be to install Chax over it.
The thing is that the Chax installer doesn't allow it (Snow Leopard only).
How can one modify the installer so that it runs on Lion?

A: Why you need Chax, if for strict HTML tags in AIM account
You can change option in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.AIM.plist
search option "ForceICQPlainText" change to YES
save and set ReadOnly :)

A: Even if you could install it, it won't work on 10.7.  
I used to deploy Chax as part of my default build - the auto-accept file transfers from local Bonjour users was worth it - but it hasn't been updated in some time, and Apple is moving toward the new Messages app and away from iChat.  (Leave them feedback about how much of a regression AirDrop was, compared to iChat.)
