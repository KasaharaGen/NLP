Q: Why can't I access Server.app in Lion Server? I can't access Server.app in my mac mini server, i don't know why.
The username and password are correct.
How can I solve this problem?

A: I found a problem, the servermgrd was not running, I was search in Active Monitor and no found it.  
To resolve just run:  
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.servermgrd.plist
