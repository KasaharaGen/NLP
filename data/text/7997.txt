Q: iTunes is not recognising my iPhone after upgrading to Lion I've just upgraded my Mac to Lion, and now my iPhone is not being recognised in iTunes.
I've tried...


*

*Updating iTunes (to 10.5) 

*Checking for all updates

*Restarting both the Mac and iPhone

*Extracting iTunesHelper.app from the iTunes bundle and installing it into the Login Items list, and confirmed it's running in the Activity Monitor.


For the past 3 years I've been happy with the "It just works" idea, but not today. :(
What other options are there?

A: Start by checking in the system profiler under USB to see if the Mac see's that the iPhone is connected.
.

Then remove the following to the Trash and RESTART the computer
/System/Library/Extensions and Locate the file AppleMobileDevice.kext
