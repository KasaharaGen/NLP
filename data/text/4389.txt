Q: What are the secret options of the PDF convert tool from OS X? I recently discovered the /System/Library/Printers/Libraries/convert tool that is able to convert HTML, DOC, ... to PDF. 
It works great but it has some optional arguments that are not documented: -a 'name=value ...'. I am really interested about them because these are supposed to control more of the 'printing' process.
/System/Library/Printers/Libraries/convert
Usage: convert [ options ]

Options:

  -e                   Use every filter from the PPD file
  -f filename          Set file to be converted (otherwise stdin)
  -o filename          Set file to be generated (otherwise stdout)
  -i mime/type         Set input MIME type (otherwise auto-typed)
  -j mime/type         Set output MIME type (otherwise application/pdf)
  -P filename.ppd      Set PPD file
  -a 'name=value ...'  Set option(s)
  -U username          Set username for job
  -J title             Set title
  -c copies            Set number of copies
  -u                   Remove the PPD file when finished
  -D                   Remove the input file when finished


A: The options for the CUPS system are mainly for specifying borders, margins, how many pages per sheet, etc. They are documented on the CUPS website:
http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/options.html

A: What you see is a symlink to /usr/sbin/cupsfilter. 
cupsfilter is documented in its respective man page.
Its purpose is to allow you to manually run the same filtering chain CUPS would run on behalf of a given print queue would run when consuming a given input document. This way you could inspect + debug the results before/without sending the job to the actual printer.
Of course you can "abuse" the utility also to convert files to whatever output format you may desire (if supported by CUPS).
Regarding the -o name=value (running cupsfilter directly uses this syntax): basically it is every option you can specify with print command such as lp or lpr if you print from the shell. 
A few selected examples:
-o media=A4                   # define the media size
-o fit-to-page=true           # request scaling of content to fit media
-o page-ranges=1-4,7,9-12     # select pages to be extracted
-o number-up=4                # request multiple logical pages on physical page
-o number-up-layout=tblr      # set the sorting of logical pages
                              #   (first top-to-bottom, then left-to-right)
-o page-border=single-thick   # request page borders to be drawn
-o outputorder=reverse        # request reverse output border

*All generic options supported by CUPS are documented here:

*All printqueue specific options (as are escrowed in the associated PPD) can be derived from the outputs of this command:
lpoptions -l -d <name-of-printqueue>
