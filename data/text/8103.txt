Q: How can I remove iOS 4.2 from an iPad? I need to remove iOS 4.2 beta from an iPad which I added using iTunes and the option+click Restore button feature. 
When I click "Restore" in iTunes I get an error (image attached). I have the iOS SDK & XCode installed.


A: Step 1: You need to put the iPad into recovery mode.
Press and hold the home and sleep/wake buttons until the device shuts off. Keep holding the home key until the "connect to iTunes" graphic appears on the screen.
Step 2: Make sure you have iOS 3.2 somewhere on your system. Drag it into the organizer. 
You can get any version of the iOS firmware from here.
Step 3: Open XCode's organizer and connect the iPad.
Step 4: Select your iPad in the organizer and choose the firmware version on the top right.

NOTE: You can probably use replace steps 3 and 4 with Option + Click in iTunes, just make sure to have the proper firmware lying around on your system.
NOTE2: Excuse me, I meant iOS 3.2, not iOS 4.1. I'm a little distracted at the moment.

A: You need to have iOS 3.2 because that's the only other iOS version that supports iPad. Follow the steps Moshe posted.
