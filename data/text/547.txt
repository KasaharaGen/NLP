Q: Does the iPod Classic respond to the clicker buttons on the iPhone earbuds? I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the iPad supports the clickers on the iPhone headphones (volume up/down, play/pause, etc). Does the most recent iPod Classic series respond to these buttons as well?

A: Yep. Check out this link on Apple's site. I'm actually surprised to learn so many devices support it now.
