Q: MacBook Pro, external display black screen with 1680x1050 I have bought a new monitor Samsung SyncMaster 2243. I have been using it normally on windows with 1680x1050 resolution for almost a year now. I tried to connect it to my MacBook Pro via VGA to Mini display port adapter. It worked fine but 1440x900 resolution showed up. So I tried to set it to native display resolution 1680x1050 and now only thing I see is black screen. It works only for a few seconds per minute approximately. There are flashes. I cant lower the refresh rate, there is 60Mhz and no option to select lower.
Do you have any ideas what to try? Apple documentation says that Mini display port to VGA adapter supports 1920 resolution.
Thank you

A: Apple today released an update that addresses external display support in Macbook Pros.  Give that a try.
