Q: How do I extract Parallels Desktop's dock icon? Parallels Desktop has ugly red bars on its icon. How can I remove those bars?

A: First, see this article. It eliminates the red bar well.
Anyway dock icon when Parallels is not running shows bad icon. You can replace this icon in app's resource folder. Anyway we don't have the clean icon now. To get the clean icon, follow these steps.


*

*Find Parallels Desktop's PID.

*Run GDB as superuser. Attach to Parallels Desktop.

*Execute Objective-C that saves code for current dock icon image into a file.


See this console log.

You'll see the icon with Preview app.
Take care about you have to replace the file path /Users/Eonil/Temp/t.tiff to path exists on your computer.
This hack will extract current icon. So if you want to extract other icon, just make your Parallels to show the other icon and use this hack at the time.
