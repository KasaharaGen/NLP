Q: How to remotely view photos uploaded to iCloud? Is it possible to view the photos we upload to iCloud from icloud.com or somewhere else?
Are the photos available anywhere?

A: Enable the photo streaming, then you can view the photo from any device connected with your apple ID and have iCloud enabled.
Check the Photo stream page on apple.com : http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html

A: In a nutshell, you don't. 
iCloud doesn't have any feature for hosting your content for others to see. Only giving (or entering) your password into software that speaks iCloud allows the content to be viewed or "shared". 

A: Once you have enabled photo sharing with iCloud on your device that has captured the image it will upload to the cloud.
You will need to enable the other devices you have to also enable iCloud sharing,
Once this is done you can view on these devices, oddly you cannot view them on the iCloud website.
