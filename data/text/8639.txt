Q: How to install a .qtz screensaver in Lion? What are the instructions to install a .qtz screensaver in Lion?

A: Move it into ~/Library/Screen Savers if you are the only one who wants to use it, or into /Library/screen Savers if you want all users on the machine to have access to it (note ~/Library is hidden by default in Lion: you can access it by holding Option when clicking the “Go To” menu in Finder).
