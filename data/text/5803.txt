Q: Can't enable File Sharing under OSX Lion So I've upgraded to Lion, but now I can't enable File Sharing, when I press the checkbox, it simple shows the "correct" symbol and in less than half of a second it removes it again.
This happens the same for the 2 checkboxes under the Options... as well.
What can I do to enable File Sharing again?



A: It turns out it's not only me, but following this amazing tutorial everything whent smooth and worked out nicely...
