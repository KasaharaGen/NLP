Q: Alternative to Quicksilver Triggers Well after using QS for quite some time, it no longer works...Even when loading it on a clean SL build with latest Apple updates.  When I set up a trigger they will only work until I reboot.  At that point none of the trigger action works.
I heavily use(d) custom triggers and I am not having any luck finding a alternative to QS with that functionality.  Do custom triggers only exist in QS or are there alternatitives? 
EDIT
Just thought I would add the problem descibed with triggers is known with b58 and now with the latest b59.  So if b59 is not even on blacktree's site and only on qsapp.com (as someone posted), meaning brand new I guess the next hope is b60.  Who knows when that may be available though.

A: You are not alone in this problem and in fact I bought Alfred as part of addressing this problem.
It looks like there are some other users still trying to get Quicksilver working, and even though it is not really in active development, there is an article on how to download two different versions of Quicksilver, and then selectively deleting or merging files together. 
Honestly, given this level of annoyance, I would go with Alfred.

A: Guys, Quicksilver has just been updated (!!!).

Commence rejoicing.

A: I have used Launchbar for several years after getting frustrated with QuickSilver's lack of updates. It is rock solid and I have never had an issue with a system update breaking it. I would give it a big thumbs up.
