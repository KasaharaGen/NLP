Q: Showing the taskbar in Parallels Coherence mode I just installed Parallels 6 and upon launching it for the first time, it started up in coherence mode and I saw the taskbar overlayed the Mac OS X UI. After a few seconds, though, it disappeared. I tried enabling the relevant settings I found related to this, but I was never able to get the taskbar to appear again.
How can I show the taskbar in Parallel's Coherence mode?

A: *

*Switch to Coherence view.

*Hold option and click the Parallels button in the Mac OS X system tray.

*Navigate to View > Show Windows Taskbar.
