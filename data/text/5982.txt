Q: How does MacOSX 10.5 chose between networks with the same SSID? I have a Linksys router with dual-band networking. I set the 5ghz band to WirelessN and the 2.4ghz band to wirelessG. If I set them both to the same SSID, will the Mac automatically chose the faster WirelessN band? Is there a preference I need to set for this?

A: No - the timing of the beaconing signals and whichever is the strongest SSID in the limited window it looks gets chosen. It's a flip of the coin most times. The N does win out more than the G - but it's not a surefire thing by any stretch.
