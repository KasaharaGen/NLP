Q: Keyboard layout editor that works on Lion So far I've been using Ukulele for editing my keyboard layout (I assigned some shortcuts to Alt+key and changed a few others). Unfortunately, after upgrading to Lion, it's broken.
The point is, Lion changed behavior of pressed keys -- they don't repeat, apart from punctuation that does.
But I can't fix it, since Ukelele apparently uses some PPC program.
Is there any other keyboard layout editor for Mac?

A: I use KeyRemap4MacBook, it works on Lion. It's a preference pane.

A: A possible alternative is

but I have never tried to use it myself
