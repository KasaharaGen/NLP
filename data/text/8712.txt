Q: I want to sync my previously never synced iPhone to a Mac. Is there a risk of data loss? I want to sync my previously never synced iPhone (filled with 2 years of pics & music) to my mother's Mac. Is there any risk of data loss?
It has never been linked to a computer. I have many pictures & videos of my baby & don't want to lose them!

A: Yes - there always is a risk of data loss even though the software (iTunes and iOS) are designed to let you make a backup and transfer all data before it erases anything. 
Best to go online / call apple or visit a store and research how to prevent an automatic sync for your version of iTunes and the steps to back up / transfer that content before you start. 
Without knowing your iOS version and iTunes version it's hard to be more specific. It should go fine, but best to be prepared beforehand. 

A: Here's how to do it:


*

*Connect your iPhone via USB to the Mac.

*Start iTunes

*On the left menu in iTunes, your iPhone should appear.

*Do a right click on your iPhone

*You have two options now:



First: Select Backup. So your iPhone creates a local backup of your
  whole iPhone data. 
  Second: Select "Transfer Purchases"

So all your Music, Videos etc. should be transfered to the Mac. 

I would prefer to create a backup first, and then transfer all your
  purchased data.


A: You have to use an iTunes where no iPhone have been previously set up.
So even a second computer, or you set up another account for the OS (Windows or Mac OS). Then you will have the choice to backup the phone...

A: You can transfer all music and pictures on to her Mac.
Open finder and navigate to the iPhone, you can then extract all the images as you would with a digital camera. 
To take the music files you will need to use a piece of software such as Xilisoft you cannot manually take the audio from an iPhone as it appears as a camera unlike an iPod which appears as a harddrive.
