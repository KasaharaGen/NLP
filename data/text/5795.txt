Q: Google Chrome bug in OS X Lion Is it just me or is there a right-click bug for Chrome in OS X Lion? I first noticed that double finger tapping the trackpad didn't show any menu when in chrome (either on a link or on anything).
I thought it was a problem with my trackpad settings in OS X Lion but I checked the Finder and Firefox and right-clicking DOES work. Was it broken together with other mouse gestures in OS X Lion? 
Is there a current fix for this?

A: Looks like it was one of my plugins: Mouse gestures. I was wondering why it was working on my speed dials page(the right click) and when I turned off gestures, right click suddenly worked.
