Q: Shortcuts & gestures you can't live without What are some gestures or shortcuts you use on a daily basis that you can't live without?
I've found the BetterTouchTool preference pane add on to be great for creating custom gestures on a per app or universal basis

A: ⌘ + ~ to move between open windows in the current application

A: ⌥+⌘+⇧+V to PASTE AND MATCH STYLE 
(paste plain text, maintaining formatting of document you are pasting into) - if supported by the program

A: With Quicksilver, I added a ton of keyboard shortcuts for programs and folders, such as:


*

*⌘+⇧+P - Pictures

*⌘+⇧+D - Documents

*⌘+⇧+C - Google Chrome

*⌘+⇧+T - Terminal

*⌘+⇧+H - Current work folder

*⌘+⇧+E - Root of drive

*⌘+⇧+M - Movies


Ones I use most that are native to Mac:


*

*⌘+⇧+⌥+esc - Force kill app

*⌘+⇧+4 - Screenshot with saved jpeg on desktop

*⌘+I - Get info on file

*⌘+[ - Back

*⌘+] - Forward

*⌘+↓  - Go into folder

*⌘+↑  - Go out of folder

*⏎  on file - rename file


A: Three finger swipe left or right to move between tabs in my browsers.
Configured this universally through BetterTouchTool - it simply activates the appropriate keyboard shortcut

A: ⌘ + ⇧ + ⌫ = Empty trash.
There's something satisfying about hearing that trash emptying sound : )

A: Capture Screen shot:
⌘+⇧+3 (captures entire screen immediately)
⌘+⇧+4 (draw a rectangle to capture)
⌘+⇧+4, then space (click a window to capture)
Add ctrl to any of the above to copy to clipboard, rather than saving a PNG to the Desktop.

A: Sleep all displays:
ctrl+⇧+⏏

A: Do it and don't ever tell the victim how to undo:
ctrl+⌥+⌘+8 (only until Lion)  (spoilers)
Couldn't possibly live without it, above all. It was fun while it was default... :-(
So, I'll add a handful of spoilers below on how it could still be done.
Unfortunately it now comes disabled. To re-enable it, find Keyboard Shortcuts Accessibility.
Or, after OS X 7, it won't be as smooth (even if you do practice positioning the mouse):
⌥+⌘+F5 then select Invert Display colors (apple article)

A: Seems like a silly question for Stack Exchange, but here goes. And I'll be more realistic than most folks.


*

*Two finger scroll

*⌘+Q (quits app)

*⌘+W (closes document/window)

*space for Quick Look in Finder

*space for play/pause in most media players

*⌘+C (copy)

*⌘+V (paste)


A: Hot corners


*

*Upper left - show all apps

*Lower left - show frontmost app

*Upper right - show dashboard

*Lower right - show spaces


Track pad gestures


*

*Two-finger scroll

*Four swipe up - show desktop

*Three-finger swipe down in Google Chrome - show tab exposé


3rd party system


*

*⌥+⇥ - cycle through frontmost applications windows (using Witch)

*⌘+§ - show my Finder visor (using Total Finder)


Misc Apple


*

*ctrl+⌘+K - switch keyboard layout (I regularly switch between Swedish and American)

*⌥+⇧+volume button - raise/lower volume using 1/4 increments

*⌘+P - set in Keyboard Shortcuts to "Save as PDF..." which allows you to press cmd-p followed by cmd-p when using e.g. a web browser to print to PDF.

*⌥+←/→ - move caret back/forward one word

*⌘+←/→ - move caret to beginning/end of line


Misc Applications


*

*⇧+⌘+T - undo close tab in Chrome

*⌘+space - Launch Bar


A: These are my current BetterTouchTool settings:


A: ⌘ + , to open the current application's preferences. Works in practically every OS X app that has a preference pane.
By comparison, in Windows preferences don't have a common shortcut and the menu entry, typically labelled either "Preferences" or "Options", can be found pretty much anywhere in the menu hierarchy (although often it's in one of Edit, Tools or View). Command-comma was one of the things I really loved when I switched to OS X.

A: ⌘ + ⇥ to switch between open applications

A: Let's see...


*

*⌘ + space for bringing up Alfred

*⌘ + ⇥ for switching between open applications

*⌘ + T to open a new tab in Safari

*⌘ + ⇧ + 3 to take a screenshot


A: Safari or Chrome


*

*⌘ + ⇧ + I : Send email containing current page's url + title as subject


BetterTouchTool


*

*Three finger click : middle click (the most useful)

*Three finger swipe left : ⌘ + ⇧ + [

*Three finger swipe right : ⌘ + ⇧ + ]
The three finger swipes, work in most apps which have tabs or tab-like interface i.e. Web Browsers, Terminal, iChat, etc

A: Safari/Chrome/Firefox:
three-finger-click: ⌘+W
two-finger-swipe-up: ⌘+⇧+T
This makes closing and reopening tabs super easy. With a three-finger click I can close a tab, and a two finger swipe up I can reopen it. Quick access to tab history is great when you've got lots of projects happening in lots of windows.

A: Safari


*

*Rotate Right - ⌘+⇧+]    

*Rotate Left - ⌘+⇧+[

*Threefinger Click - MiddleClick


The rotate right/left gesture is kind of like your twisting a bottle-cap on and off. I use this to switch between tabs if I'm just browsing the web.

A: I'd rather use KeyCue from Ergonis Software which helps me find all the shortcuts and gestures an app can have. Check it out here!
But my favorite commands remain  ⌘ + ⇧ + F in the finder to create smart folders.

A: There are only a few I couldn't live without…
⌘+\  <- Using visor, I've got terminal set to drop down from the top half of the screen.  I use it very, very often
⌘+ctrl+D  <- Dictionary - works most of the places I need it to.
⌘+space  <- Spotlight - Invaluable.  
I may be moving away from terminal, and towards iTerm2.  iTerm2 has the same functionality built into it.

A: No one seems to have mentioned the  ⌥ keymodifier very much! 
⌘ +W Closes a window
⌘+M Minimises a window
Throw ⌥ in with these and it will apply the command to all windows in that application!
⌘+⌥+W Closes all windows in current app
⌘+⌥+M Minimises all windows in current app
Bonus tip: Hold ⇧ to slow down practically all window animations (minimise, Exposé, etc).
