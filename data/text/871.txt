Q: Can I assign Magic Trackpad 3-finger swipe up/down to scroll to top/bottom? I have the trackpad on my Macbook pro set up to scroll to top/bottom on a 3-finger vertical swipe. As far as I can tell, that option isn't there for a Magic Trackpad.
It's very confusing to have both devices behave differently on the same gestures. Is there a way to fix this?

A: My Magic Trackpad did this right out of the box. I believe you should select "Swipe to navigate."
