Q: Why can't I jailbreak iPod Touch 4g 4.3.3 (8j2)? Every time I go to jailbreakme.com on my device, the site says "Not supported on your device."
Like I said, I have an iPod Touch 4g, ios 4.3.3. And the site clearly says my version and device is supported. Help please, thank you.

A: Try going to Settings>General>International and choose region format "Hawaii United States". Then open www.jailbreakme.com again from Safari.

A: I found the answer: I was not using Safari.
