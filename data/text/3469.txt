Q: MySQL - Ruby on Rails mysql gem not working on snow leopard i have installed mysql 5.5.11 and i'm running on Snow Leopard (10.6.7)
when i create my rails application everything wokrs fine:
rails fooTest -d mysql
then 
cd fooTest
then
rake db:create
and i get:

Couldn't create database for
  {"reconnect"=>false,
  "encoding"=>"utf8",
  "username"=>"root",
  "adapter"=>"mysql",
  "database"=>"fooTest_development",
  "pool"=>5, "password"=>nil,
  "socket"=>"/tmp/mysql.sock"}, charset:
  utf8, collation: utf8_unicode_ci (if
  you set the charset manually, make
  sure you have a matching collation)


A: This looks like a permissions problem.  Make sure you have a password set in your mysql and are able to login from the command line
mysql -u root -p

This should prompt you for your root password.  If you can login there, that means you should be set.  All you need to do then is put the password in your database.yml file and retry the rake command.

A: Try using the gem mysql2 in RoR. I had the same problem as well.
