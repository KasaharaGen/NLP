Q: What does the Delete key do on the English QWERTY keyboard? I have a French AZERTY keyboard with a Backspace key (that can be modified with Fn into Delete) and to my surprise I saw on the Apple Store that the English QWERTY keyboard had a Delete key in its place, so I'm wondering if it's really a Delete key (erase right) that can be modified with Fn into Backspace, or not.
Edit: If I try on the virtual keyboard with American layout, the key does erase left.

A: On the English QWERTY keyboards, the Delete key functions as a Backspace key, and can be turned into an erase right key with the fn modified key.

A: The Delete (delete forward) key, when standalone, is called Del on both Mac and PC keyboards.  Of the 6 keyboards I have convenient here (1 each full size and laptop PC, 2 full-size and 2 laptop Mac), the delete-backwards key is called Backspace on the PC keyboards and Delete on the Macs.  (The Del key is called that on all the keyboards that have it or a marker for it.)
Pedantically, the Macs are correct, as the concept of "backspace" doesn't include erasing but the Backspace / Delete key does erase.
