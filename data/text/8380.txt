Q: Where are iOS 5 Camera Roll folders stored when synced with Windows? iOS 5 has introduced the ability to create folders in the image library, and copy pictures from the camera roll to these folders. 
When synced on a PC (on Windows 7), where are those pictures stored? How can they be managed on the computer? 
I'd like to find them to be able to save them, and add/remove some pictures from those folders.
I know the way to add "hard" folders to the image library from the PC, but those can't be managed on the iPhone.

A: The sync image location would be the same as the one you have selected as your Sync folder via iTunes Photo sync. I have also found a less complicated - drag/drop method for a two-way iPhone photo transfer between your device and the PC. It is less of a hassle since you can manage your iPhone photos, add and move them around and sync them to your PC directly from your computer.

A: Mine get put into my pictures folder in the same place you iPhone puts them when it asked when y plug iPhone in it should ask do you  take pictures off because computer thinks my iPhone is a camera so it ask to download photos
