Q: Listing all Openmeta Tags and associated Files Some month ago I started using openmeta tags to manage my files. Is there a tool which shows all openmeta tags on my mac and the files tagged with these tags?

TagLists

*Free

*Tags & Tag searches for file lists must be made manually

*ie. doesn't list created tags, which was what you were after

*

*but hey, the price is right!







A: Nifty Box was a great free, scriptable application. 
I wrote some nice AppleScripts that could go through tags and color certain files.
