Q: Problems sending images from my iPhone from one GMail account to another I recently came across a problem where I used to be able to send myself a photo from one Gmail account onto another Gmail account now I keep getting message undelivered. I deleted my Gmail account on my iPhone and set it up again still the same results. My iPhone is running on iOS 4.2.1.
