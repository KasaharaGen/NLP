Q: why do iPhoto, Word, and Finder open when I restart Lion? I'm using Lion (10.7.2).  I close all applications and restart the Mac.  When it starts up again, it opens windows for iPhoto, Word (to a blank doc), Address Book, and a Finder window.
None of these application are in my "Login Items" for my account.
How do I get Lion to start clean instead of opening all these apps?

A: Back up your system before trying this, in case it messes anything up, but I'd recommend this procedure:
In the Finder, press âŒ˜ShiftG for "Go to the folder:" then type ~/Library/Saved Application State/. Delete all the folders in Saved Application State, then press Command-I to Get File Info. In the Get File Info window, check the "locked" box. This should keep applications from restoring their state.

A: FYI, I reinstalled Lion and the problem is now gone.
