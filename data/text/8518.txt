Q: Can I install/upgrade from SL to Lion on RAID0? I have a 2007 Mac Pro with a 3-disk RAID0 bootdrive.
I want to do a clean Lion install on the RAID volume but I'm not sure if there are any known issues with doing this. I seem to remember that last time I did something like this the installer crapped-out when it encountered the RAID. I got round this by doing a clean install on a different (single) drive, backing it up and then reinstalling it onto the RAID volume. Quite painful.
I understand that I'll have to create the Recovery HD on an external drive but this aside, does anyone have any knowledge they can share? I'm hoping that the lack of info online means that its perfectly fine and I'm worrying unduly ;-)
Thanks.

A: I think you should be fine. I upgraded to Lion on a Mac Pro that has a RAID 0. While the OS is installed to an SSD, not RAID, Lion still detected the RAID just fine. That's obviously a different scenario than what you have, but as the software RAID is handled at a higher level than the OS, I think you should be fine.
Obviously, have a backup ready to go just in case, but my guess is that your upgrade should go smoothly.
