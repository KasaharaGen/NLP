Q: Can I charge a 4th gen iPod touch with the Galaxy tab's charger? Can I charge a fourth generation iPod touch with Samsung Galaxy Tab's charger?

A: You can plug a standard Apple 30pin USB Charging cable into the Galaxy Tab charger and it will work fine.  Both the Apple and Samsung chargers deliver 5v output (although the Samsung one delivers a higher current).  It is perfectly safe to use.

A: NO I tried it, it didn't work.
