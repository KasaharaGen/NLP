Q: Change keyboard shortcut for {} and [] in German keyboard layout I'm new to Mac and using a Macbook Air with Lion and a German keyboard. From my PC I'm used to other keyboard shortcuts for {} and [].
Currently it's alt + 8,9 for {} and alt + 5,6 for []. Can I change this to the PC ones (cmd + 7,0 and cmd + 8,9)?

A: Try Ukulele. It's a keyboard layout editor for Mac OS X.

A: I've managed to create these shortcuts with Spark: http://www.shadowlab.org/softwares/spark.php
