Q: Encoding video for the new (2010) Apple TV What applications are recommended for encoding existing videos from various sources (ripped DVDs, MKVs, AVIs ...) into a format playable by the new (2010) Apple TV?

A: Somebody's gotta make the first obligatory post recommending HandBrakeâ€”might as well be me.

A: The new Apple TV really doesn't really decode individual video codecs - it streams them from local and remote sources. I suspect, though I'm not 100% sure since I don't have mine yet, that if you're interested in streaming to your Apple TV from a local computer, you should convert to the standard formats well supported and playable by iTunes (h.264, quicktime) which will stream over the new(ish) airplay support.
