Q: SCPlugin icons and menu I installed SCPlugin on my mac for subversion. It works fine but I don't see the icons show status of my files. And I don't have SCPlugin's options in my right click menu bar. Any idea how to fix these?

A: for the menu bar, there is a workaround that you can start from the top bar of your finder window. it's almost as good as with the right-click context menu.

Because of the invisible icons I am also searching for help.
