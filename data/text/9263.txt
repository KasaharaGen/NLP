Q: I upgraded the software on my iPhone and my Yahoo Calendar stopped syncing via CalDav I recently updated my iPhone to IOS 5.0.  I was syncing my iPhone calendar with my Yahoo Calendar using CalDav.  After the upgrade the syncing stopped working.  I tried deleting the calendar sync profile and re-adding it, but when I get to the step where it verifies the settings, it fails.  What can I do to fix it?
