Q: Why can my Mac charge my iPad but other computers can't? What do Macs do differently so its USB ports can charge my iPad, but if I plug into a USB port on my PC I get the "not charging" message?

A: Apple's newer machines (and some newer PCs I believe) have got USB ports that are able to provide more current. The following Apple KB article explain better:


*

*iPad: Charging the battery

*Powering Apple and third party peripherals through USB

A: Because the iPad needs more than the 500 mA that the USB 2.0 spec says computers need to provide.  Macwork has more information.
