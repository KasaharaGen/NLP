Q: iTunes in 2 Countries I have an iTunes account in the UK but I am going to spend 2 months of the year in the US. Is it possible for me to download from the US iTunes Store but keep my UK credit card and billing address?

A: No, it's not, you'll need a separate credit card and billing address for each country. 
A work around would be to use your US address and use gift cards for purchases. 
I do this, as I don't live in the US, but want access to some content only available in the US store.
