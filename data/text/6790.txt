Q: Caller ID spoofing or change caller ID? Is there a subscription site or iPhone application for changing caller id or caller id spoofing? In other words I want to call someone, but I want to change my number (for example 000000 or 111111). How can I do this?

A: Most carriers support the *67-prefix when calling a phone number. This does not change caller ID but at least it hides it.

A: If you're eligible for Google Voice, you can sign up for an alternate phone number, place a call from the web with your Google Voice account, and Google Voice will call the number you want to dial as well as your phone.  Then, don't have calls to your Google Voice number forwarded to your phone.  If the caller obtains your Google Voice number from caller ID, they will be able to leave messages but not call you back directly.
