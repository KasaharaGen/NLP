Q: Can't print from OS X 10.7 to shared printer on OS X 10.6 I have a network with 2 Mac OS X computers in it. 
When I try to print a text document from my upgraded OS X 10.7 to the shared printer on OS X 10.6, my print job gets stuck at the "job pending on server" message. 
When I look at the printer spooler on the 10.6 machine, I see the job as "printing" and the message "sending data", but the printer doesn't print anything. There's no reaction at all, and yes – I checked the cables.


A: Solved the Problem. The shared Printer was connected to a Belkin USB Hub, which again was connected through an USB slot to the Mac OS 10.6 Laptop.
