Q: can't download apps after "authorizing computer" I recently synced my iPod touch(4th gen) for the first time and it asked me if I wanted to "authorize the computer"- I chose "yes" but now, I can't download apps(neither from my ipod nor from the computer). It asks for credit card info. but since I don't have a credit card, now I can't download apps(free ones) at all. 
Deauthorizing doesn't seem to help either. 

A: Try this procedure to create an iTunes App Store account without a credit card.
