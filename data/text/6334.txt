Q: How do I connect to a Windows Remote Desktop with a Terminal Services Gateway in OS X? The Microsoft-provided RDP client here:
http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client
Does not support connecting via a Terminal Services Gateway. Are there any other options?

A: Unfortunately, neither Microsoft's own client nor the popular CoRD alternative currently support it, and the latter likely won't for a while.
I haven't tested it, but the â‚¬20 iTap claims to support it.
