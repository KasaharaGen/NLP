Q: Cycle through windows with keyboard in Adobe Acrobat I use Adobe Acrobat Pro a lot, and often keep multiple documents open. Does anyone know of a way of cycling through the open windows of this application without resorting to the mouse?
(Cmd+` (backtick) does not work.)
I use OS X 10.6.4 on a 13" MacBook Pro.

A: You can try Cmd + F6. It's working on both Mac OS & PC.

A: Are you referring to cycling through all open windows in all apps, or all open windows within Adobe Acrobat?
If the former, use ⌘tab to switch between apps, and then ⌘` to swap between windows in that app.
If the latter, ⌘` works just fine for me (Adobe Acrobat Pro 9.3.4; 15" MacBook Pro running OS X 10.6.4; no particular third-party addons that might change this behavior).

A: I had given up on this for a long time, but trying it once more I noticed that the "`" requires to be pressed for longer for the switch to happen. Once it switches you have to let go quickly or it will switch back to the 1st document.
Hope this helps.

A: You might want to take a look at Witch (http://manytricks.com/witch/). It'll give you many more options for how you can cycle through windows and open apps. It's not free ($19), but there is a free trial.

A: option+command+backslash (on french keyboard) (`, on english probably)

A: On Mac OS X 10.11.1 with Acrobat Pro DC installed try controltab.
