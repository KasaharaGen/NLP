Q: Move Developer Folder I want to free some space on my SSD.
Is there a way to move the Developer folder from my root drive to another one without breaking anything?

A: Some files in the /Developer path are referenced when you launch specific functions within  Xcode. If you need to recover space and absolutely has to move /Developer, you could try


*

*Move the /Developer folder to the alternate path and symlink it so
that Xcode still finds it at /. Note: I haven't tried it with Xcode 4.x, so please share if this works.

*alternative is to do a clean uninstall using 'sudo
/Library/uninstall-devtools' and custom reinstall Xcode by
specifying a different path.


A: It might not hurt anything, or it might. A better (if more time-consuming) solution might be to delete your existing Developer folder, then re-install the dev tools to the drive you want them to be on. This will ensure that everything that has to be in /Developer is there.
