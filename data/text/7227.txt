Q: Is it possible to duplicate images in LittleSnapper? The reason is that I have some screenshots of full websites. Though for inspiration and illustration reasons I need to crop them to show different parts of that website. I know that when you crop an image in LittleSnapper it does not damage the original but I really would like to be able to see the full image AND the cropped version
So that is why I need to know if there is a way to make copies of the image. Of course there is always a long way of doing it; such as drag it to the desktop and drag it back in, or go back to the web page. But does the application have a copy and paste (images) feature
Thanks

A: LittleSnapper keeps it's images in special library file, so the only way to copy images is to do the long way that you described.
I'd recommend you get on the LittleSnapper discussion board over at RealMac to add your voice to the group of users who'd also like to get at their images in a more flexible way.

A: You can do it easily by using Windows Painter. Just go to your desired page, click "Print Screen", then open Windows Paint and paste onto it. After that, crop as you need.
Keep in mind, coping images or webpages may be subject of copyright.
