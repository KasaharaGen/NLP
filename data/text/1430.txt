Q: How to prevent TextMate from overwriting symbolic links? In a web project I have multiple environments and a .htaccess.<env> file for each of them. In each of the environments I've made a symbolic link from .htaccess to the right file.
Now, whenever I use TextMate to edit the file through the symlink, the link gets overwritten by a copy of the link's target file. How can I make TextMate to preserve the symlink?

A: Disable Atomic Saves in Advanced Preferences.
When atomic saves are enabled, TextMate actually writes to a new file on Save and then moves the file over (hence overwriting your symbolic link).
See http://manual.macromates.com/en/saving_files#atomic_saves for more info.
