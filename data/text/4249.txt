Q: Block prompts when sites detect I'm using iOS On many forum web sites, if you go to the site on an iPhone/iPod/iPad it prompts to install an app for the site.  But 90% of the time when I visit a forum site, it's because I'm following a search result; I never ever want to install the app. Is there some setting in iOS that disables this kind of prompt?

A: These sites are using JavaScript to detect Mobile Safari's user agent and displaying an alert.
You can disable JavaScript in Safari's settings but it's probably not worth the lost functionality.
