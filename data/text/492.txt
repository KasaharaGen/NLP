Q: What are the pros and cons of IMAP/CalDAV vs. Exchange for GMail and Google Calendar for iOS 4? I am trying to decide if it is better to use the IMAP/CalDav option for accessing my GMail/Google Calendar on my iPhone vs. Using the exchange connection. Anybody got pros and cons of the different options?
What I know so far is this:


*

*I have to use exchange for syncing contacts, so I will have exchange setup for that no matter what.

*The IMAP/CalDav option doesn't have push

*The Exchange option seems to be buggier than IMAP/CalDav


Any other thoughts?

A: Exchange (Google Sync) for GMail lacks some features that you are probably used to--search and cloud drafts. The "known limitations" are listed here: http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139635.
My experience with CalDAV in iCal are that multiple calendars on a single account are a bit squirrely to work withâ€”you won't be able to get each calendar listed by itself under the primary google account heading. The calendars end up in a set of subfolders, depending on how you end up configuring it. That said, I don't know how the same thing would look on the iPhone.
What I do and recommend would be to continue using IMAP for GMail access--there's nothing wrong with it and you don't gain anything by moving to exchange. I do use Google Sync for contacts and calendars since it's the closest I can get to the functionality of MobileMe for free, and I'm very happy with it. For desktop access (aside from the webapp) I like BusyMac (post hyperlink limit reached; Google it) Software's products: one is an iCal superset clone and another is a sync utility that makes your Google Calendars show up in iCal just like MobileMe would.
