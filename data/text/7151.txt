Q: Battery indicator is not moving further from 96% I bought a new macbook pro, till the day I bought the battery indicator is not moving further from 96%. 
I wonder if there is a problem with the battery because if I unplug my power cable it is still showing 96%. 
My previous Mac used to show 100% or "Charged" but in OS X Lion it isn't the same, is it? 

A: Over time, a battery will stop holding 100% of its charge. This is normal. After a good 1-2 years of constant use, I have seen this happen on all of my batteries. 

A: You probably need to recalibrate your battery. This will essentially tell the OS what the full charge is and in general make the "% remaining" more accurate. You may also need to reset the SMC
