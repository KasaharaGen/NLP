Q: How can I write files to iPod's internal disk on Windows? when trying it I get the "can't do that" icon


How can I copy new photos to the iPod?


A: Got it
I used iPhoneBrowser and I could easily add photos to iPod Touch Library :)

But there is a problem, with this, I don't get the photos/videos on the PhotosApp on the iPod Touch :(
