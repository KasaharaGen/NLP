Q: Can Mail.app be configured to always load remote images from certain domains? I like how Gmail gives me the option to, for example, Always display images from allsongs@n.npr.org. 
Is there a way to have Mail.app do the same? I can only find the global option for displaying remote images in HTML messages.

A: Short answer
There is no specific option for this. But you can define a rule and run an applescript.
Solution


*

*Save applescript below with any name and to any folder you want.

*Go to Mail app > Preferences > Rules and click Add Rule. Give name theRule to your new role and select conditions that you want to display remote images. For your question this should be From > allsongs@n.npr.org.


*

*You could also select Sender is in my Address Book to display remote images for all mails come from  your contacts.


*Under Perform the following actions: section, select Run Applescript and choose the file you wrote at step 1.

*Save the rule.
Applescript
