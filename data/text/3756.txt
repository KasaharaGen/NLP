Q: Push notifications no longer working? Push notifications for any app are no longer working with my home WiFi network. I'm running an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.3.2. I tried 5223 port forwarding and even disabled my router's firewall. 
Strangely, they do work when I use public WiFi. Any idea?

A: Try resetting your router and add in the security features you use, one by one, until you see what 'breaks' push notifications.
