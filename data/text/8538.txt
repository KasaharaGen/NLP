Q: Installing iOS on VMware Workstation I have a Windows PC and VMware Workstation. I am trying to figure out a way to install iOS on it.
Is there is way to install iOS on VMware Workstation?

A: No.  See relevant Stackoverflow discussion. 
In short, you need to virtualize the ARM cpu, not an x86 model. Additionally, you'd need to virtualize the swipes and taps and whatnot, which would be quite the tall order.
Here's one project that's attempting to virtualize iOS on the QEMU platform: IEMU.
