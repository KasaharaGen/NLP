Q: How do I connect to my web server on mac? On Ubuntu, I was able to connect to another server using "places". Is there anything like that in Mac OS X?

A: In Finder, choose Go > Connect To Server (command+K) and type in the URL or IP for the server (including the protocol if not afp).

A: The application I would call the most "PuTTY-like" in MacOSX is JellyFiSSH. OSX has a native terminal application, and you can go on ahead and use it for all command line work, but JellyFiSSH has a lot of nice helpers like saving "bookmarks" for connections, bookmark grouping, tunnel management, and more.
It does NOT, support auto-discovery. I don't know what Ubuntu's "Place" looks like, so I cannot distinctly comment. However, you emntion SSH, and you mention PuTTY, so I'm going to recommend JellyFiSSH. It's a great helper application to an otherwise daunting command line task.
