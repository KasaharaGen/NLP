Q: How can an old Apple ID be merged into the newer ID? When I first creed an Apple account, years ago, I used a password which I've been using ever since. Later I joined Me.com and I was assigned an email address that also became another Apple ID for me. More recently, with the new iCloud it looks like only my email address will be accepted as the ID t... So, how do I merge my now "old" ID into my newer @me.com address? Thanks.

A: As of now, you cannot merge multiple Apple IDs into one Apple ID. It has been rumored but it is not possible at the moment.

A: Apple still working on it. I know about it from last news.

A: Here's an idea.  What you can do, if you haven't bought much or anything on your new ID.  You can change the email address on your apple ID once every 90 days (which is important, make sure you do this right the first time).
So change your me.com address to something else entirely.  Make a new temporary email on gmail if you have to.  Then change your old apple ID to your current me.com address.  And all your old purchases are now under your brand spanking new email address.
