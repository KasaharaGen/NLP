Q: Can I use 2 iPhones as walkie talkie? (without internet!) I want to use 2 (or more) iPhones as walkie talkie (i.e. they talk each other without needing internet/voice call).
Of course this should work with wifi, because it doesn't make much sense a to have bluetooth or usb connection for this application...

A: There's an app for thatâ„¢.
WiChat will allow you to chat with the Bonjour protocol, that is, chatting with people on the local network without connecting to an external server.

A: There are several apps that will do this in the iTunes Store. The search to use is "walkie talkie". I recommend you look first at Walkie-Talkie - iOS.
