I need to automatically run a command when I log in but I don't want to add an item to the Dock. How can I do this?

A: If that's really a command, not app, then you do this by deploying launchd, Apple's standard daemon/agent manager.
Creating plist files by hand is error-prone, I suggest you to use Lingon.app
It used to be free, now it isn't anymore, but instead available on AppStore (if you're using the latest OS X 10.6.6).
