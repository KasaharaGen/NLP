Q: Suggestions for an iPhone app for contacts I am looking for an iPhone app for our sales team that would allow them to do the following:


*

*Group contacts into custom groups

*Add meeting notes against a contact

*Locate contacts on a map (optional provide directions from current location)

*Store extra images such as business card against a contact

*Doesn't screw up Outlook contacts


A: Here's one that appears to do what you want, and happens to be free:

A: You might need to use something like Bento or FileMaker.
