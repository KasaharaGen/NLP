What Window Management Options exist for OS X? 

I want to be able to resize and move a window without using a mouse. 
Recently I found shiftit, which is 80% what I need. The only thing it is missing is the window resize. And it is not updated since 2010 :( .
Is there a better alternative?

A: I use and love Divvy.  You can define grid layouts and hotkeys to invoke them.
