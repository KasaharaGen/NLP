Q: How can I convert video and audio files into iPod/iPad playable formats? I am quite a non-technical guy when it comes to such stuff and hence looking for "easy" solutions. 
On Windows, I had used Red Kawa Videora to convert the various audio and video formats to iPod-playable formats. I think it also has a version which works on Mac. 
I would like to know if there is other (possibly better and as much or more user-friendly) software which does the above job of converting various audio and video formats into what Apple products can play. (I guess what works on iPod also works on iPad.)

A: HandBrake used to be my go-to app for this task but lets face it: nightmare UI. Especially if you're a professed "non-technical guy".
The new wonder-in-a-box video convert is Smart Converter. Like HandBrake, it's free. Unlike HandBrake the UI is very non-threatening. Drop file, pick output format, go. Works for video and audio.

A: I'd say that HandBrake is a good start.

A: Switch is what I use for all my audio conversions. Although it says you need to pay for it, there is a free version. It may seem somewhat confusing, but it's free. As Ian C. said, Handbrake is the best video conversion software. (because it's free!!!)
