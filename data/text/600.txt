Q: Round iPod connector My car stereo claims to support my iPod touch, and has an iPod connector that is round. The car is second-hand, and no cable was supplied. It isn't the specific adapter shown below - nor indeed that specific ipod, but it is the same connector - and simply, I don't recognise it.
Searching for "round ipod cable" hasn't been fruitful. is this a common/known connector type?


A: My first thought on seeing that was that it looks like a 9 pin DIN connector. So I did a quick Google and it looks like there are such things as 9 pin DIN to iPod leads. This lead for example looks to match (though the picture quality is rubbish so it's hard to tell).
