Q: How can I sync places between iPhone and computer? I'm looking for a way to drop pins on the map from my computer and have those pins accessible on my iPhone.
I know Maps app has Bookmarks but it appears I can't sync them with Google account or anything. Can I achieve this functionality, with or without third-party apps?

A: Google Places does exactly that.

You can manage places through web interface or the iPhone app.
Places marked with a star (Saved for later) will be displayed in Saved section in the app:

You can rate and review places from the app as well.
