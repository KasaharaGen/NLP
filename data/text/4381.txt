Q: Control iMac and LED Cinema Display Brightness Simultaneously I have a iMac 27'' and a LED Cinema Display 27'' connected to it. And I've noticed that to be able to control brightness I need to open the Display.prefPanel  and modify the brightness of the displays individualy.
Is there a way to do this simultaneously? Maybe with a third party app? If not, is there a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to the second display brightness?

A: I just started using Dimmer Than Dim, a free app in the App Store. I only have one display (iMac), however.

A: F.lux is worth a look, it changes the colour temperature and brightness of your monitor(s) based on the time of day.

A: Shades can do this.
(I am pretty sure it can, I only have one monitor attached at the moment, so I can't verify.)

A: Lunar has Sync Mode which automatically detects changes in brightness on your iMac screen (even those made by the light sensor) and syncs them automatically to the LED Cinema display.
It doesn't use a software overlay. In fact, Apple vendored displays get special treatment as Lunar uses an implementation hidden inside macOS Display Services to control them natively.
Note that you have to connect the USB port of the LED Cinema to the iMac to enable the DisplayServices method of changing brightness to work.
