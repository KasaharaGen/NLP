Q: iPhone backlight blinks on then goes out. What are my options? This morning I woke up to find my iPhone dark. If I pressed the home button to turn on the screen, the backlight would flash on briefly and then die. I've turned it on and off, done a hard reboot (home+lock), and I'm in the process of trying a restore.
Has anyone ever seen a similar issue?
The phone was purchased last June with a contract from ATT from an Apple store. If I take the phone in, will they fix it or replace it?
What should I do next?

A: You should take your phone in. They will fix it if they can and it's cheaper for them than giving you a new.
If you try to fix it yourself they can put the blame on you, so don't touch the hardware. 

A: It may be your proximity sensor. It's what causes the backlight to turn off when you put the phone to your face and turn back on when you move away. I was told that that's one of the few things Apple Care does actually cover. 
But before you take it in, do you have a bumper on your iPhone? If so, it may be covering the sensor, which, while facing the phone, is just to the left of the earpiece. If your bumper (or maybe a dirty screen protector) is covering it, that may cause the screen to stay dark.
Hope this helps!
