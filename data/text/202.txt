Q: Is there an OS X dashboard widget for notes from the iPhone Notes app?  I'm looking for a Dashboard widget for OS X that allows you to read and edit notesâ€”the pieces of text in iPhone Notes application and Mail.app. (I.e., something analogous to the To Do Widget which shows the same To Do items that you can access through iCal.)
I don't use Mail.app regularly and would like some quicker way to access the notes synced from my iPhone.
Edit: To reiterate, this question is specifically about the notes in iPhone's Notes app (screenshot below) and in Mail.app. (And not e.g. about alternative notes apps for iPhone/OS X or iCal's To Do items.)


A: If you are looking for a way to sync and edit notes, then I suggest Simplenote. It isn't a Dashboard widget, but it's very lightweight and all of your notes are saved to a central server that all of your devices can see.

A: AFAIR Organized does what you want (among other things).

A: This doesn't exactly answer my original question either (which is about an OS X dashboard widget for accessing Notes), but it is the most useful note syncing solution I've found so far: 
You can now (with iOS 4) sync Notes over the air with any IMAP email account. And MobileMe accounts too, as the relevant Apple support article points out: iPhone and iPod touch: Syncing Notes.
Specifically, you can easily sync Notes with your Gmail account. This blog post gives good instructions with screenshots. 

Of course, in a way, a cloud-based approach like this is even better than having a widget on the one Mac you sync your iPhone with. There's this drawback though:

The notes can only be edited from an
  iPhone or iPod Touch 

In other words, you can only view them in Gmail.

A: I'm stuck with the same question but what I've managed to find is a useful widget for the mail.app and ical todo's. You can download it at http://todo.philipefatio.com/
