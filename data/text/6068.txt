Q: Where is the previous recipients info in Entourage? Where is the "Previous Recipients" info in Entourage?  Can it be edited?

A: You can do it, though it's done in kind of an odd fashion.
From the Entourage 2008 Help file:
To delete a single entry from the recently used address list, you must first add it to your address book and then delete it from your address book.


*

*Click Mail, and then click New.

*In the To box, type the first few letters of the address. A list of suggested addresses appears.

*On the pop-up menu of addresses, click the recently used address that you want to delete.

*Press CONTROL, click the address, and then click Add to Address Book. The address appears in a new contact.

*On the Edit menu, click Delete Contact. If a confirmation message appears, click Delete.

*Close the message, and then click Discard Changes.


You can also clear the entire list in one go by choosing Entourage > Preferences > Mail & News Preferences > Compose, then clicking Clear List.
