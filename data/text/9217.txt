Q: Sync iPad & Dumbphone Contacts via Bluetooth? My Mom's main computing device is now an iPad. It's been working great for several months, but I'm trying to do what I can to get her to make use of its full capabilities.
One of the things I wanted to do was help her organize her contacts. Right now she's just using a dumb phone, but it's got Bluetooth and I'd love to find a way to transfer contacts from her iPad to the phones address book. I'm pretty sure this is a no-go with the built-in iOS functionality, but are there any apps that can do this?

A: This is not likely to happen, as you need to mannualy accept a bluetooth data transfer, so it will not sync exactly, what you are doing is basicly sending a contact card to the phone.

A: Take a look at BitPim.
It allows you to connect via USB to the filesystem of many dumb phones and extract address, calendar, etc., data therein.
