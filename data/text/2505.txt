Q: How do I select more than one file in LaunchBar? Is it possible to select multiple files in LaunchBar?  (For example, I may want to select two files in a folder and "drag" them to another folder.)  How do I do that?

A: I found a post on the Objective Development Forums that suggests a different approach:


*

*Select the file to move or copy (either in the Finder, or in LaunchBar).

*Copy it (⌘-C)

*Select another file (again, either in the Finder, or in LaunchBar).

*Use ClipMerge (Press ⌘-C twice.)

*Repeat steps 3 & 4 if you wish to select more than two files.

*Select the destination folder.

*Paste (⌘-V)


I was skeptical until I tried it.  It works quite well.

A: An update for LaunchBar 6
Version 6.0 introduced a slick way of selecting multiple items. The LaunchBar folks call it the “Sixth Sense”. Selected items are held in a “staging area” and can be acted upon all at once using typical LaunchBar tools. 


*

*Typing Command-A will select all items in the search list.

*Typing a Comma (“,”) will select the current item and allow you to move on to select more.

*Pressing Shift will scrolling up or down with the arrow keys select continuously as you scroll

*You can undo these actions by repeating them with a selected file. Hitting Escape clears the selections.
The selection then works with other actions: Press Tab to send them to another folder, etc.
There’s a discussion at the LaunchBar blog
