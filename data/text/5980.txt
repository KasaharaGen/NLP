Q: How can I trim the first 3 characters in file name with AppleScript? Is there a way to trim off the first 3 character of multiple file names? (or last 3 characters)

A: Here's a shorter script:
tell application "Finder"
    repeat with f in (choose file with multiple selections allowed)
        set name of f to text 4 thru -1 of (get name of f)
    end repeat
end tell

Renaming files is often easier in the shell though:
for f in *; do mv "$f" "${f:3}"; done

Parameter expansion is documented in file:///usr/share/doc/bash/bashref.html#SEC30.

A: This code will do it for you:
set whichFile to choose file with multiple selections allowed
repeat with aFile in whichFile
    tell application "Finder"
        set filename to name of aFile
        set name of aFile to ((characters 4 thru -1 of filename) as string) --trim first 3
        --set name of whichFile to ((characters 1 thru -4 of filename) as string) --trim last 3
    end tell
end repeat

Note that stripping the last three will get rid of the extension. If that isn't what you want to happen, let me know in a comment.

A: Here is an Automator Workflow as a Service that will do what you want it to do.
All you have to do is load this workflow, and duplicate it to a Service and call the Service "Trim First 3" or something, then save it.
Then select a folder and select this service and it will take all files in the folder and trim the first 3 characters of the file name. 
Good luck.
