Q: Open PDF using Google Chrome I like the fact that I can use Google's built in PDF viewer instead of a separate application (Adobe Acrobat). Normally I would open a Finder Window with the PDF and drag it to a tab on Google Chrome but this process becomes two steps if the PDF is to be downloaded first.
I tried changing the default application for PDF using "Get Info" > "Open with", but it does not seem to work properly. I still have to drag a file to a Chrome Tab. I would like to ideally double click to open as well as drag to the Chrome icon in the dock.

A: Make sure you click the "Change All" checkbox in the Get Info window.
