Q: Tweetdeck replacement for Mac Is there a Tweetdeck replacement for mac? A program that'll allow me to post to both my Twitter account and Facebook accounts with a single action?

A: Try HootSuite. If you want it to become a desktop app, use this.
Otherwise, you can use the official Twitter client and configure the Twitter Facebook App to post your twitter updates on facebook.
You can also use Google Chrome and Mozilla's Prism (as a extension in the browser or as a standalone) to do the same thing.

A: I'd probably check out Socialite ($20).

A: The latest Twitter API terms of service  specifically prohibit clients posting to multiple social networks with a single click

5E: You may not use Twitter Content or other data collected from end users of your Client to create or maintain a separate status update or social network database or service.

So, even if clients like Hootsuite allow it now, I would expect them to not be able to do that in the future.

A: Babble
