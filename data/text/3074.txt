Q: Mac music tagging software Since the switch from Windows to Mac, I've been looking for a good music tagging application for Mac OS X. 
I've tried apps such as Tagalicious, TriTag and a few other apps, but none have made me happy so far. Basically I'm looking for something similar to Mp3Tag (which is Windows only).
Just asking before I consider starting an open source project and do this on my own.

A: Here are a few options:

A: I've mostly used TriTag or temporary AppleScripts like this:
tell application "iTunes"
    repeat with t in selection
        --set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "-"
        --set ti to text items of n
        --set track number of t to item 1 of ti
        --set artist of t to item 2 of ti
        --set album of t to item 3 of ti
        --set name of t to item 4 of ti
        --set name of t to (get track number of t)
        --set name of t to my titlecase(get name of t)
    end repeat
end tell

on titlecase(x)
    do shell script "ruby -Ku -rubygems -e 'require \"titlecase\"; print STDIN.read.chomp.titlecase' <<< " & quoted form of x without altering line endings
end titlecase

on replace(input, x, y)
    set text item delimiters to x
    set ti to text items of input
    set text item delimiters to y
    ti as text
end replace

on split(input, x)
    if input does not contain x then return {input}
    set text item delimiters to x
    text items of input
end split
