Q: Associating Contacts to Companies within Address Book I've started using iCloud to manage my contacts. One thing I really like is the ability to have custom defined fields, and have them voice activated from my iPhone.
One problem however is this small (niche) area with regards to my company. I know that I can easily work around it, but I'm hoping for a definitive answer.
Here's the example.
Say I have 3 people who work for my company.

Smith, Joe
Doe, John
Lew, Sue

My company is called Acme Holdings Inc. and there are two campuses.

Acme Holdings North
Acme Holdings South

Now I'd like to have in my address book

Acme Holdings Inc
--Phone--
North Campus (555)-1234
South Campus (555)-5678

Then I'd like to be able to voice dial one of my co-works with the following command

Call Joe Smith, North Campus


So my question is, is there a way to associate a company with their respective contact information to each of the employees without having to do double/triple entries?
My problem is compounded with the fact that there are 20 some co-workers that work back and forth between 3 campuses. I'd like to have all of them in my address book.

EDIT
The reason the association would be nice would be because I don't want to have to enter the "Acme Holdings" contact numbers for each staff member. It's just nicer if you have an "Acme Holdings" contact card, and point all of the staff to it, and the custom "North Campus" and "South Campus" phone numbers are automagically attached to each contact.
