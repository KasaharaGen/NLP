Q: Print HTML to PDF while retaining hyperlinks I'm trying to create a PDF document from an HTML document.
Of course it's easy to do this using the built-in PDF Printer, however, this does not retain hyperlinks.
I've tried wkhtmltopdf which looked very promising, but it crashes on every attempt.
Is anyone aware of any other options for generating a PDF document from an HTML document while retaining URL links?

A: The built-in Safari browser seems to do this when you do File -> Print -> PDF -> Save as PDF, it works for me as of Version 6 of Mac Safari.

A: Found an answer over on SuperUser.com: wkpdf
Free, works perfectly. All hyperlinks retained.

A: You can do this using Adobe Acrobat.
In Acrobat, go to File-> Create PDF-> From File. Select your HTML doc, let it do a bit of work, and then use File-> Save As to save it.
All hyperlinks will be intact.

A: Old question, but just found out if you open the .html in Microsoft Word and then save as pdf for online distribution, then the link works.

A: I have tried dompdf in the past and has worked very well for me. dompdf PHP

A: Check out the "Save as PDF" browser plugins:
Chrome plugin:
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kpdjmbiefanbdgnkcikhllpmjnnllbbc
Firefox plugin:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-as-pdf/
Both are free, but developed by a commercial company http://pdfcrowd.com.
I tried the FF plugin, and except for some minor layout overlapping in the converted PDF document, all hyperlinks were clickable and working.

A: http://pdfcrowd.com only works, if the link is public - so no printing of pages, where you are logged in.
