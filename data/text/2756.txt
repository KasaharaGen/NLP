Q: iPhone's 3G usage counter Maybe this is silly but...
How can I find out the 3G usage on my iPhone 4? (like a counter telling how many Mbytes I have been moving over the 3G network)

A: 3G data usage is listed in the General Application under Usage.
But you can also download AT&T's app or Vodafone's app to check it from their perspective as well.

A: As Michael pointed out you can use the usage stats in Settings to find this out although I would be surprised if your carrier doesn't provide you with this information.
What network are you on? Most of them even have apps which tell you your call/text/data limits when logged in (or at least they do here in the UK).
