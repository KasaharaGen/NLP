Q: Change search Google in Safari to use Firefox Cmd+Shift+L searches for the selected text in Google using Safari. Can I change this to use Firefox instead?

A: You can create a new service with automator, use the "Run Shell Script" action, and use:
open -a FireFox "http://www.google.com/search?q=$1"
as the shell script text, then save it as "Open with Firefox" or whatever you like.
-or-
follow this summary from this thread:

*

*Download and Install OnMyCommand/OMCEdit


*Open OMCEdit


*Click on "Download Commands" then "Download"


*Go in "Command Library"


*Choose #22 and click on "Append to Command"


*Change the name if you want (in "Command Name")


*Write " Top Level " in location if you don't want a sub-menu, or choose a name for the sub-menu ("In On My Command" is the default)


*Save


*You're done!

A: What you need to do is create a new Automator service. Unfortunately, Firefox's AppleScript support sucks, so you'll have to do it manually.
You should be able to use a combination of the tips in this article and this comment, and the page Calavera linked to should give you a general idea of how to format the URLs.
