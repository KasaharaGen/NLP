Q: Mac won't boot with new RAM installed I have a Mac mini (Macmini3,1). I was origionally told that, at most, it can only take 4 GB of RAM. When I bought the Mac it had 2 GB so I went to Fry's and got 2x 2 GB sticks.
Here is the info on the memory. Both are the same; I can't remember the manufacturer's name.
Size:   2 GB
Type:   DDR3
Speed:  1067 MHz
Manufacturer:   0x8502
Part Number:    0x505344333247313036363253000000000000
Serial Number:  0x00000000

Today, I got Mactracker from the App Store. It has data on all the Macs that ever existed.
It says that the Macmini3,1 has a maximum capacity for 8 GB of RAM but Apple only supports using up to 4 GB. Before I go out and get the RAM, I'm wondering if any of you have tried putting 8 GB of RAM on a Macmini3,1.
Today I bought this RAM.
I installed the RAM as someone suggested but the Mac wouldn't even boot; what I mean is the power supply wouldn't even turn on. I just saw the white light in the front and that's it. I left it on for 5 minutes and still nothing. I took it apart checked all wires a few times and tried a few times and still wouldn't turn on. I eventually gave up and put the old RAM back in and it worked.
Is it possible that the RAM is bad and I should have it replaced? Or I should use another brand?

A: I can only suggest that you have a faulty ram. Try installing just one stick of ram to see if it boots.
