Q: Access Time Capsule's files from iPhone Is it possible to access Yime Capsule's files from iPhone? On my Mac I'm simply connecting to afp://10.0.1.1/ and I have my data.
But on my iPhone, when I try to connect (e.g. from Safari) I get an error.
Is it possible to browse AFP servers from iOS? Or maybe there's a way to enable WebDAV on it? 

A: It is not possible to access server shares from Apple's iOS. iOS does not have a Samba or AFP client, and thus, cannot handle these requests.
Time Capsule uses modified AirPort Extreme firmware and supports AFP and SMB file-sharing protocols.
Unfortunately, this is the extent of your capabilities of accessing files on Time Capsule from iOS. Sorry :(

A: Oplayer HD is a great app. I use it just for watching videos of any format and last time I used it I saw it also had automatically connected to my data folder on the time capsule. Meaning I can download movies onto the time capsule and then watch them from my IPad. super convenient. Oplayer doesn't open every file, but more than you would think. 

A: It is possible with 3rd party software.
There are dozens of apps in the App Store for browsing afp/smb network shares, including Time Capsule internal drive.
Some apps focus on video, some focus on documents, some trying to do both.

A: Use file browser on iTunes it'll do the job
