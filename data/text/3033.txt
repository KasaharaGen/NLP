Q: Uncompress (zlib) files that "S3 Backup" compressed to Amazon S3 On windows I was using "s3 Backup" to backup files to amazon s3. One of the options is to compress with zlib. 
As far as I can tell there is no mac version of this app. So now I need to figure out how to uncompress those files as I bring them on my mac. Anyone know a good way to uncompress files that were compressed with zlib?
The files retain the same name and extention after they had been compressed. I tried adding different extensions to the ends of the files to see if some standard compression programs would uncompress them but they did not.
I have also tried messing around command-line with the "uncompress" command. But no luck there either. Unless I can figure out a way to uncompress them I will be force to re-upload everything to amazon with compression off. 
thanks in advance

A: To help figure out what these files are compressed with, you can try using the file command from the terminal. It should give you output like this:
% file archive.zip 
archive.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
% file archive.tgz 
archive.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Wed Aug  3 06:21:00 2005, max compression
% file srchive.bz2
archive.bz2: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k


A: zlib compression is built in to Mac OS X.
If the files are not automatically unarchived, you can try the following to unarchive them:
Add a .zip extension and open the file. This should do the trick. If it doesn't, try the following.
Open Archive Utility (/System/Library/CoreServices) and go to File-> Expand Archive.
Navigate to your file and let it do its thing.
Let us know how this works for you.
