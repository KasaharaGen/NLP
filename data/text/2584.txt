Q: Move to Start of Line in Terminal.app Is there a quick key combo that will allow me after typing some stuff in the OSX terminal to move back to the beginning of that line?  I have tried different things, and was wondering if there is a way without setting up something that is custom.

A: CTRL+a moves to the beginning of the line, CTRL+e to the end of the line.
