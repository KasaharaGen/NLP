Q: iPhone configuation utility for Windows not working I am using the iPhone Configuration Utility 3.3 and I had an iPad plugged in - while trying to deploy a profile, the application just crashed.
After this, I attempted to launch it several times but it would just crash immediately.
I looked through the ipcu.log file and saw that it had problems with a cryptographic key. I used Microsoft/Sysinternals Process Monitor and tracked down the key it tried to open and deleted it.
After doing this, I reopened the utility and it recreated a key and launched fine.
From here, I can create profiles, but when I try to install them on a device, nothing happens at all on the device, but going in to the console view, I see the device reporting this:

I have Googled for ages and seen other people suggesting deleting various folders including the iPhone Configuration Tools Cache, Device and other folders, but I have had no luck whatsoever.
I have run this tool on another machine with the same device and configuration profile and it works just fine. This is just on this one machine.
I have tried reinstalling without any luck and cannot find the file that it is trying to load. Based on the invalid profile warning, I have a hunch that it is still something related to cryptography/keys and profile signing, but, I just can't find it.

A: I figured out that reinstalling the profile file into iOS Configuration Utility fixed it for me so probably make copies.
