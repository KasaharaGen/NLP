Q: How can I choose to unrar with the default application? I recently installed unrar for Mac Os X but i found it useless sometimes and bug-full.
So i uninstalled unrar. Now if i open a .rar file, another application (VLC) open it.
But i want the default unrar application to manage .rar files. How can i do that? If i select the "Open with" options and i look for that application in the applications folder i cant find it.

A: There's no default application to handle .rar file on Mac OS X.
You might want to try The Unarchiver. It can open many format besides rar files.
Then once you installed it, open its preferences and select all the file format you want him to manage.
