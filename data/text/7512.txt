Q: Help getting Nautilus running under MacPorts I have been trying to run Nautilus on OS X 10.6.8 without any luck. First, I installed MacPorts, then installed Nautilus. However when I try to run it from the command line, I am getting an error. I came to this thread and followed the instructions given. However I am still getting this error:
(nautilus:27170): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.
    Using the fallback 'C' locale.
Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display "/tmp/launch-42nv45/org.x:0".

** (nautilus:27170): WARNING **: Can not determine workarea, guessing at layout
nautilus: Fatal IO error 0 (Unknown error: 0) on X server /tmp/launch-42nv45/org.x:0.

And then X11 stops unexpectedly. Can anybody tell me how to solve this?

A: You need to install XQuartz instead, which is a package providing an X11 server for Mac OS X.
