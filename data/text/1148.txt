Q: Is there an AFP Server for Windows? We're only a very small company, we don't have a proper Windows server, but we do store central documents on a Windows XP Pro machine via Windows file sharing.
The boss's MacBook Pro will connect and use the shares, but often will get itself into a state where the shares no longer work - navigating to the "server" in the Finder shows zero shares, yet all our Windows machines still work as they should.
I've asked a question elsewhere (serverfault, I believe) about trying to fix the connection problem, but I've not managed to find a solution yet. 
We currently only have one Mac in the office, but that may soon rise if we land a certain project, so I'd like to find a workaround, perhaps by using a non-samba sharing system. 
Is there an AFP-compatible server that will run on Windows XP?
Alternatively, are there other file sharing technologies that we can use?

A: If the Mac doesn't "see" the windows file server, you can always use the "full name" or IP address of that server, starting the address name by "smb://" in the "Connect" dialog (Cmd + K in the Finder) :

See this Apple Note for more details.

A: Try the program "PcMaclan" on Windows XP.
It's a AFP Server Program.
