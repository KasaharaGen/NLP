Q: Change Terminal.app's Default Shell to BASH How can I change Terminal.app's default shell to BASH?
For some reason, my friend's Mac (10.6.6) defaults to using TCSH instead of BASH. The obvious remedy is to choose /bin/bash as the command to open shells with (as below), but then it fails to load .bashrc and .bash_profile (even if I give a --source or --rcfile parameter).

How can I switch it to use bash the right way?

A: By using chsh from Terminal. It changes default shell for user. Alternatively you may setup Terminal to use /bin/bash -l ... this will cause BASH to behave as login shell, i.e. it will read .bash_profile.

A: Open System Preferences, select user and right click on its name.
"Advanced options..." will appear. Change shell there.
If you're die hard Apple user, you probably will have to enable right click first.
Depending on your computer model, it can be done under Trackpad or Mouse Preferences.

A: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal will create login shells even if you choose a custom shell in Startup preferences. So your initial problem should no longer be an issue on Lion. (Although I recommend setting the shell via System Preferences to ensure it's set for the user account and not just for the Terminal application.)
