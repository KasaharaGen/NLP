Q: "Contextual Menu Items" folder missing on my Mac. I just can't find the folder "Contextual Menu Items" on my Mac.
I tried these paths :
/Library/Contextual Menu Items
/System/Library/Contextual Menu Items
/Users/nnnn/Library/Contextual Menu Items
Nothing found.
I didn't use "Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature lately".
Thanks for your anwers.

A: I know exactly what's going on:
...drum roll...
You don't have that folder.
If you need it, you can just create it.
