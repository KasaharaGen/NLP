Q: How can I invert spelling proposals on iOS? Is there a way to invert the behavior of the spelling proposal ? 
By "invert" I mean : 


*

*Don't change what I have typed if I don't do anything special 


AND


*

*Select the proposal if I tap on it


A: You can disable "Auto-Correction" under Settings > General > Keyboard.
The check spelling will still be on and taping on the word detected as wrong will prompt you the corrections.
