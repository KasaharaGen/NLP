Q: Diagnosing iMac hard crashes OS X 10.7.x, (updated to 10.7.2 when it became available last week); Quad Core iMac.
Hard crashing about every 2 or 3 weeks, except had one yesterday and another today, 5 times total so far. Mouse and keyboard go dead.  Screen frozen. Doesn't respond to LAN ping.  Dead.
Reboots fine.  Nothing at all about the crashes in the console all-message log.  No evident problems, operating normally.
Note: This machine has had no kernel panics at all in about a year, since I bought it, by the way.
My two suspects are 


*

*Add-in-RAM -- maybe I should have bought the most expensive instead
of moderate-priced 4GB modules , a few weeks before the first
crash.

*Firefox 7.0.1, as that was the active app when the last 2 crashes
occurred.


I'm keeping notes on the date, time, and front-most app when the crashes occur.
Any ideas? Any instrumentation to add?  Tests to run? (Given the time between crashes, I doubt a memory diagnostic is going to find anything.)

A: You could try testing the hard drive with Smart Utility, but it sounds like to me that it is your Ram that you installed. I have personal experience with bad/incompatible ram and the symptoms you are describing are exactly what happens if the ram is the aforementioned.
