Q: Terminal issue with export PS1="" So I tried to change the output of my terminal prompt but when I try something like /W it just puts the /W not the path.  For example export PS1="/W $ "turns my prompt into "/W $"

A: It needs to be \W, with a backslash.

A: That should be a backslash, not a slash: \W.
