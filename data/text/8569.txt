Q: Is it possible to add iCloud Reminders to iCal calendars? In iCloud, each Reminder is placed in a named list (called a "List" in the details dialog, and a "Calendar" in the context menu in iCal), but there seems to be no way to assign a reminder to an existing ("normal") iCal calendar (as there was with pre-iCloud "To Do" items).
 
Is there a way to assign a Reminder to an existing iCal calendar?

A: No. With iCloud and its supporting operating systems (iOS 5 and OS X 10.7.2), Apple has split the calendar stores on its online CalDAV servers to be either event-only, or task-only. Reminders sync to task-only calendars. See this Apple Support article for some details.
