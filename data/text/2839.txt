Q: How can one create a shortcut for pasting unformatted text in Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac? iWork provides the keyboard shortcut Cmd-Option-Shift-V to paste text without it's original formatting. How can I get this or a similar shortcut key for Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac?

A: I found the answer in this blog post
Create the AppleScript:
try
  set theClip to Unicode text of (the clipboard as record)
  tell application "Microsoft Word" to tell selection to type text text theClip
end try


Save in
  /Users/YourUserName/Documents/Microsoft
  User Data/Word Script Menu Items as
  Paste unformatted\mosV.scpt (the
  backslashed bit at the end of the
  filename provides the shortcut).
  Restart Word and you can now paste
  without importing extraneous styles
  with Apple-Alt-Shift-V.


A: There's a "PasteDestinatationFormatting" command.
Go to Tools > Customize Keyboard, then select "All Commands" in the left pane.
In Word 2011, the default keys are command-option-shift-v.

A: Answer to the same problem but for Microsoft Word 2011: how to assign pasting as unformatted text to Cmd+V.

A: I don't know about Word 2008 but for Word for Mac v16.16.7 (whatever edition that is), I was able to use a version of the Tools > Customize Keyboard solution. Once there, select Edit on the left and PasteTextOnly on the right. Then, add whatever keyboard shortcut you want, e.g., command+V. I have not extensively road tested this but it seems to work. 

A: This blog post describes a method by redefining Cmd-V to a custom macro:


*

*Unbind Cmd-V from standard “Paste”.

*Record a macro for Cmd-V.

*Fix the source code of the new macro (by replacing wdPasteDefault with wdFormatPlainText).


If you want to keep standard "Paste" functionality it might be better to use another key combination though.

A: If you assign a short cut key to "Paste Special..." it's just another quick DOWN and RETURN to paste without formatting.
