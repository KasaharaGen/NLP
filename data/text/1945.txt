Q: What command combo at terminal will output a list of directories with human-readable sizes? I'd like to open Terminal.app and enter a command like:
my-macbook-pro:~ my-username$ ls -lh
Instead of seeing the size of the folders in bytes that are in my current working directory, I'd like to see size of the folders, including all of their contents like so:
drwxr-xr-x  7 my-username  staff   100Gi Dec 20 19:38 my-huge-project-folder
drwxr-xr-x  3 my-username  staff   80Gi Dec 27 14:15 my-slightly-smaller-project-folder
Is there a command I can type that will yield similar output above?

A: In order to see a list of folders with sizes you can use the du command.
To make the sizes human readable use the -h option
To make sum the size of child folders use the -s option (may take some time to run depending on the contents).

du -hs *


Here is an (uninteresting) example of the output.
