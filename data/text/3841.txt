Q: Outlook 2011, Where are the mails stored? Just as the mails in Outlook under windows are stored in a PST file , where are the mails in Outlook under Mac stored ? 
I understand they are stored as OLM files . But can anyone tell me the exact location of these files so i can perform a backup ? 
Thanks.

A: According to Microsoft's support site:

Outlook stores only the indices in the Database (with a capital “D”) file and stores the data records as a series of files nested within folders. The Database file and its folders are located here:

~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity/Database
~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity/Data Records
