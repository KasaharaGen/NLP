Q: Can iPad show percentage when charging by USB, and does iPad 2 charge slowly too? I found that my iPad might be half charged after a few hours by USB from PC... too bad I can't find the wall adapter...  but when I turn it on, it says "Not charging" without saying the Percentage it already has charged up.  Can it show somehow?  Maybe by tapping the "Not charging" message but I don't really need to see it so many times. (but tapping doesn't work)
Does the iPad 2 also have the same issue of slow charging too?

A: The reason you get the Not Charging message is because most machines don't send enough power through USB to charge the iPad. The iPads battery is more like a laptop battery than a phone battery. Newer Macs will send enough power over some of their USB ports. 
As for the percentage, If you turn on "Battery Percentage" I think under Settings, General, Usage. This should show it up in the top right. 
Due to the iPad 1 and 2 sharing many other similarities, the iPad 2 should also display the 'not charging' message. Although, a new iPad 2 will come with a Wall Charger as well. You can purchase off-brand chargers on amazon or ebay, extra wall chargers at the apple store, and some third party companies make chargers like Griffin
