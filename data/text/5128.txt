Q: Set "Always on Top" for a window How do I set a window to be "Always on Top" like in Linux (ie, even if you switch to another application the current window will not go to the background, but it will stay "on top")? I can't seem to find it anywhere.

A: Youre probably looking for the free Afloat application. It is really very cool. ;)
