Q: Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to go to Address Bar? I just recently switched from Windows and *nix to OS X, and I miss being able to hit F6 to go straight to my Address Bar. What's the OS X equivalent?

A: Catch and remap your keystroke in the browser.
Using Google Chrome 75.0.3770.100 64 bit on a MacOS Mojave 10.14.4.
Chrome should tell you what your shortcut is under File -> Open Location...:

Clearly the shortcut is command-L
But you want to change that keystroke to be Command-e, like old times.


*

*Open System Preferences -> keyboard

*Go to Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts

*Click the plus to add a new Application specific key remapping.

*Choose Google Chrome.

*Use the string: Open Location... case sensitive, include space and dots.

*Use the hotkey detector and type command-e.

*Click add and close to save.  Restart Chrome.  Press your new key.

*The File -> Open Location... command should be executed.


Visual:

This remap appears to occur somewhere between how the Application negotiates the keymaps between itself and the operating system.  

A: To switch quickly to the Address Bar use:


*

*Mac/OS X:     âŒ˜+L

*Win/Linux:     Ctrl+L
