What is the best way to move Microsoft Office 2011 to a new Mac? 

I'm planning on reinstalling Mac OS Lion, but I don't have the MS Office install file or disk. Can I move my installed copy of Office to a USB drive and then back, or to another machine?

A: You can try to move the main folders to an external drive:


*

*/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011

*/Applications/Microsoft Messenger.app

*/Applications/Microsoft Communicator.app

*/Library/Application Support/Microsoft

*/Users/username/Library/Preferences/Microsoft

*/username/Documents/Microsoft-Userdata


Copy these Folders to the same path on your new system.

A: moving it to a USB will most likely not work, however if you've got the license key you can go on the office website http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads and download the installer.
