Q: How do I take a screenshot on the iPad? How do I create an image, containing a copy of the current screen display, on the iPad?

A: Press both the sleep/wake and the home button simultaneously, and release quickly. The screenshot will be taken (in any app) and saved as an image, available within the Photos app.

A: The Apple Pencil is the fastest way to screen shot an iPad since the buttons may be hard to reach. This also plays well into the new markup tools so you can quickly transform / edit and then share out that screen shot.

A: Press both the home button and the power button at the same time. This will save the screenshot to Photos. You can then edit the screenshot as you would a normal photo. I've noticed the screenshot comes in handy whenever you want to copy a photo, but are blocked from downloading it. :)
