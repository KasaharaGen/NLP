Q: How do I encode mp4 files with H.264 (or x264) codec in AVIDemux? I am trying to get AVIDemux set up with the X264 codec using this tutorial. The following is what goes down when I get to the ./configure --enable-mp4-output command
Thomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ sudo ./configure --enable-mp4-output
Password:
Unknown option --enable-mp4-output, ignored
Found no assembler
Minimum version is yasm-0.6.2
If you really want to compile without asm, configure with --disable-asm.

So I tried it. 
Thomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ sudo ./configure --enable-mp4-output --disable-asm
Unknown option --enable-mp4-output, ignored

You can run 'make' or 'make fprofiled' now.

I issued make, and then Thomas-Phillipss-MacBook:x264 tomdabomb2u$ ./x264 -v -q 20 -o foreman.mp4 foreman_part_qcif.yuv 176x144. And as expected, the results are: 
x264 [error]: not compiled with MP4 output support

So I'm stuck. Any ideas?

A: That's a pretty old tutorial. Try this one (linked from the official Avidemux site).

A: Fast solution:


*

*If you have x264, don't worry about un-install. Stay with it.

*Check your assembler yasm verison.  

*Install gpac --> from svn.code.sf.net and compile it. 

*Copy gpac/inlucde/gapc/ into x264

*inside x264 and configure as follow
./configure --extra-ldflags=-L/home/../gpac/bin/gcc --enable-mp4 --enable-shared --enable-debug --enable-PIC 


*You get the list in the configure x264 and you can easily find that your MP4 from 'no' changed to 'gpac'

*Enter make 

*Enter make install

*Write x264 command as x264 big_buck_bunny.y4m -o big_buck_bunny.mp4 to test it. Now you have mp4 video. In this process it's not necessary to convert raw video to h264 and then in a second step with another tool to mp4. 


A: Installed the latest version at http://nasm.us
in /usr/local/bin/nasm, ran ./configure again, fixed.
