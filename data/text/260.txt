Q: How can I revert the appearance of the close, minimize and zoom buttons with iTunes 10? The new vertical layout is causing me all sorts of grief - is there any way to revert this back to the normal horizontal orientation of the close, minimize and zoom buttons of every other Mac OS X window?

A: Do this on Terminal: 
defaults write com.apple.iTunes full-window -int -1
