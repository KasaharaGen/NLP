Q: How can I get my MacBook Pro's sound back? 
Sound isn't playing on startup or any other time. 
I'm not seeing the red glow from the headphone jack that I've seen mentioned in certain cases of this failure. Though I have noticed an awful lot of cases that at least sound like mine (sudden blanket audio failure.)
Any thoughts on how to move forward with this one? (Am currently working through this troubleshooting checklist: http://www.hightechdad.com/2011/02/10/no-output-audio-devices-suddenly-on-your-apple-macbook-macbook-pro-or-macbook-air-try-these-7-fixes/) Please let me know if this isn't the appropriate stack for this.

A: I have no idea if this will even work, but it's worth a try.

*Download Virtualbox.

*Download Ubuntu and install it in Virtualbox.

*Check the sound preferences in Ubuntu and see if any audio devices show up.


Let me know if you need help with any of these steps. If you are able to get an audio device, more than likely, there's a problem with your install of OS X.
