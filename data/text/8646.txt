Q: How can I screen share into a remote coworker's Mac? I have a coworker who should do some testing on a Mac but is a Windows user who has no desire to learn the Mac. If I could just log in to his Mac, which is on a wireless network, and do his work for him I would be so much better off. I am about 2000 miles away from him, however and we are not on the same network (it's a small company).
So...is it possible to remotely take over his computer by enabling remote administration in Settings, without being on the same network?

A: There is a long list of options, I'll just mention a few


*

*you can both set up an iChat account and use screen sharing there

*both parties can install (and log in to) Skype which provides screen sharing as well

*install TeamViewer on both machines


In your situation I would probably go with the TeamViewer option.

A: You can also use Logmein Free. I would highly recommend this because you don't need to have iChat or Skype open. Logmein shows up as a little menulet in your menu bar:
 
For security, you need to have both the username and password of the Mac you are connecting to, and, if you specify, a personal password.
 
It will also alert you if anyone is connected to your computer:
