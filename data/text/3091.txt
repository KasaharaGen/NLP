Q: Alternative for Notepad++? I really love Notepad++ and I haven't found an alternative for it yet. TextMate and TextWrangler aren't quite there yet. Specifically,  two things that I want that are not in TextMate:


*

*variable highlighting

*bracket highlighting


Can you suggest an alternative editor for OS X?

A: It's not clear from your question what exactly you're missing -- I use Notepad++ on the PC and find both TextMate and TextWrangler to be reasonable replacements -- but you'll likely appreciate either TextWrangler's big brother BBEdit 9 or, if you can put up with its alpha nature, Sublime Text 2.

A: Sublime Text 2 seems to be the real powerhouse for people that are not satisfied with the heavy guns of Mac editors:


*

*BBEdit is now on version 10 and "still doesn't suck" (you mentioned it's free mini incarnation - TextWrangler)

*TextMate (either the venerable v.1 or the long unfinished but now open sourced v.2)


Marco Arment did a nice job of rounding up not only the why but some other editors to consider with Chocolat leading the pack behind ST/BB.

A: I've recently started using Atom - it's modern, lightweight, and does a metric buttload of different things.

A: You should also take a look at Sublime 2, even if it is stll in public alpha, and Smultron. Smultron also had a Freeware Spin-Off called 'Fraise' which is now discontinued.

A: One of my former colleagues swears by jEdit - cross-platform, flexible, and friendly.

A: Editra on Mac is free, open-source, highly configurable and offers bracket highlighting.  I don't think it offers variable highlighting however.
All in all, it's my favorite simple text editor and viewer on Mac.

A: Ive had the same dilemma. I mostly use TextWrangler, but the interface is archaic. You could try Kod, which has tabs and other nicetities.

A: If you use java(not java script) there is something called eclipse. It has a built in compiler. A Couple tutorial and you will have mastered it!
