Q: Smooth zoom in safari You know the way you smoothly zoom-in in mobile safari? How do I do that on my Mac + magic trackpad in regular safari?

A: Its a pinch motion just like mobile safari.  To activate it, make sure Pinch Open and Close is ticked in System Preferences


A: Wait for 10.7 "Lion" there'll you get the same zooming as on the iPad and you can even double-click on columns to zoom the to full window width.
