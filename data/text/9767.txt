Q: Websites stuck in infinite redirect loop after upgrading to iOS 5 (5.0.1) Ever since upgrading my iPhone to iOS 5 (currently at 5.0.1), I've noticed that a few websites that I regularly visit get stuck in a constant redirect loop and never show up.  It's only sites that require logging in as a first step. The two sites that I can think of off the top of my head where this happens are:


*

*Oreilly Books Online (Safari)

*FT.com


Though I have seen this on more than just these two sites.
Has anyone else encountered this problem?  Is there anything I can do to try and resolve this on my phone (settings, cache clearing, etc.)?  Or do I have to wait for an OS update or the sites to make a fix?
Also, I'm on the O2 network in the UK, but I can reproduce the behaviour through a VPN and on WiFi.

A: To clear Safari's cache:
Go to Settings App > Safari then tap Clear History and Clear Cookies and Data.
Hopefully this will help you.
