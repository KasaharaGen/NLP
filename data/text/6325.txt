Q: Is it possible to use Linux USB drivers on Mac OS X? I have a USB device that I use on a daily basis and it has Linux and Windows drivers. I would like to use this device in Mac OS X (meaning not through a VM). Is it possible?
edit
System requirements from the read me:


*

*Linux 2.4 or 2.6

*System setup for kernel compilation.


A: No, because of completely different executable-architectures.
Only if you're willing to recompile them for OSX and they're Darwin based.
