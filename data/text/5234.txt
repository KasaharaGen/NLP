Q: What are the keyboard layouts of a MacBook Pro 15"? Can someone find me a picture of Macbook Pro US keyboard Layout and one of an English international?
I need a detailed image, because I need to know the second key assignments of each key.
Everything I found on Google had too little resolution.

A: You can find this out yourself.
Open System Preferences-> Language and Text-> Input Sources. Check the boxes for the keyboards you want. Then, check the Show Input menu in menu bar box. Click the new menu bar item, select the keyboard layout you want to see, go back to the menu bar item, and click Show Keyboard Viewer.
This will work from any computer, and you can see any layout.


The first picture was snapped while a full sized keyboard was connected, the second shows the option key held down - and is what you will see if you have a smaller bluetooth or built in keyboard connected.

A: US Keyboard layout:
