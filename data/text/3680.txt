Q: Are there any way I can have a Dashboard Widget visible all the time on the desktop? A thing that I like with Windows 7 is that I can have the gadgets (widgets) open and visible all the time, e.g. a small RSS reader in the corner of the desktop.
I would like to be able to have a small RSS reader in the corner of my Mac OS X desktop too. I already use a RSS reader as Dashboard widget, but I have to press F12 every time I want to chek it. Are there any way I can show the widgets all the time while I'm working in other applications? I haven't used the Dashboard that much before.

A: You can drag a widget outside the "screen" it appears in, if you enable the debugging mode for the Dashboard.


*

*Open a Terminal window, and execute the following command: defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES

*log out, and log in back

*press the key-combination that in your Mac shows the Dashboard

*grab the widget you want to take off from the Dashboard, and drag it

*press the key-combination that you used to make the Dashboard appear

*drop the widget when you want to place it


Alternatively, there are some utilities that enable it for you; I cannot report you which ones are, though.

A: You could try out GeekTool.  There are some geeklets available to show an RSS feed on your desktop and are relatively easy to set up if you do a bit of reading.
