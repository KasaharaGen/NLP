Q: Skype two way screen sharing Is it possible to do two-way screen sharing on Skype mac? if I share my screen with someone, the other person is unable to share theirs with me (thought their camera works). Is this a Premium feature? I've looked on http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/features/allfeatures/screen-sharing/#t_tab_mac but its unclear if this supports two way or not.
thanks

A: Screen sharing on Skype is one-way only. Only one person in the call can share their screen with the other callers at one time. With the free accounts the sharing is limited to one-to-one. With the premium accounts you can do a one-to-many broadcast and share your screen out to multiple people at the same time.
This does make some sense, two-way sharing has to overcome a huge problem of mirror-in-mirror replication. The same sort of effect you get when you place two mirrors, facing each other, and look into them. There's an infinitely repeating, but gradually reducing, view of the other mirror, in the other mirror, in the other mirror, in the other mirror...
A similar thing would occur if you were to do a 2-way share.
If you use VNC for screen sharing you can actually force the two-way share to happen and see the effect for yourself.

A: What do you want to share? I am a Windows User, and there I use Visual Studio Live Share, which is great for code / development. Since a few weeks also Visual Studio Code (the "simple" text editor for developers) has that feature as well. It works is BOTH directions and even between Mac, Windows and even Linux ...
