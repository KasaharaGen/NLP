Q: Save an app for later download? I am looking for a way to create a wish list in the App Store, like you can in iTunes on the desktop. 
Is it possible to do this on the App Store from an iPhone?

A: That is actually a feature I've seen with "third party" app stores but never in the official App Store itself. I did however just check and I guess the closest in relevancy is the feature to "Tell A Friend". I presume you could simply tell yourself by emailing the direct link for that App Store application.

A: Click the arrow next to the price and select "Add to Wish List".
