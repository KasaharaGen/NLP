Q: iPhoto does not open a window after Lion Upgrade iPhoto is not properly anymore since I upgraded on Lion. It starts and seems to be alive in Task Switcher or in the Menu Bar, but there is no open Window for iPhoto.
I re-installed from the AppStore several times, (after deleting it), but I can not open a iPhotoLibrary.
This is the console output: 
24.07.11 14:48:12.874 iPhoto: *** NSMapInsert(): attempt to insert notAKeyMarker
24.07.11 14:48:15.000 kernel: (default pager): [KERNEL]: ps_select_segment - send HI_WAT_ALERT
24.07.11 14:48:15.000 kernel: macx_swapon SUCCESS

Any idea what I could do next?

A: iLife(iPhoto is part of iLife)does not come with Lion you have to download it separately, make sure it's installed XD

A: Just find and move to the trash the next file (preferences of iPhoto)
/Users/youracount/Library/com.apple.iPhoto.plist
then, open iPhoto. 
Works for me.
