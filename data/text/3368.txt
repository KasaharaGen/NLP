Q: Status of Multitasking in iPad2? iPad 2 has the same OS however a new dual core processor should allow a workaround this limitation and allow for app-switching by freezing whatever apps are inactive at the moment. I ask this question because this is generally how I work...

*A pdf/djvu file open

*Mp3 player running

*Blog being updated

*Browsing internet


Could someone tell me their experience with such a thing on an iPad? If I switch from a browser to a pdf, does it open in the same page? If I switch back to the browser with a half written blog post, is that preserved or does it refresh? Can a playlist of songs run while I'm doing all this?
I know that its just a tablet and it doesn't promise to be a substitute for netbooks, but this is the way I work even on the go. 
On a related note, do SE sites look like this on an Ipad? I hope there is no problem in rendering Latex/Mathjax

A: With iOS 4.2 and later, both the iPad and iPad 2 will allow multitasking by freezing apps in the background. Some things, such as playing music, will run in the background. Therefore, you will be able to do all of the things you want, but you will only be able to look at one at a time.
No, the SE sites do not look like that. I used the Develop menu in Safari to change the user agent, and it rendered exactly the same for the iPad as for the default view. However, it is different for the iPhone (still not the same as the page you linked).
