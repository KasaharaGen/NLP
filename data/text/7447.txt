Q: How can I add static route? How can I add a static route "forever", that means without retyping add route in Terminal each time I'm using VPN? I found this solution for 10.6, but what if there is a nicer one for 10.7?

A: I would use Lingon to script this as a system startup - you can always use launchd to load or unload the job from the command line (or delete the route).
You don't need Lingon, it just makes it so much more friendly to assemble a plist that launchd likes to run.
