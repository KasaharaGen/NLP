Q: Preventing other network users installing Remote Desktop 3 via the AppStore I have installed Remote Desktop 3 (purchased from the AppStore) on my administrators machine. However, if one of our employees installs Remote Desktop 3 themselves onto their machine on the network via the App Store, how I can prevent them also accessing all the machines on our network?  
Or will I have to disable admin access to everyone's machines other than mine on the network?  

A: How are they supposed to know the login credentials for the other machines? And if they do know the credentials, they could probably do whatever they want with ssh, vnc, afp, etc… anyway, so no need to prohibit ARD, really.
To make it more precise: if you cannot trust your users not to spy on each other, don´t let them know each others passwords!
