Q: Can I open the menu with keyboard? With PC, alt-something opens the something in the main menu.
Does Mac have similar function? For example, is there a way to open View menu as if I click it?

A: Try CtrlF2 - that should highlight the Apple-symbol on the main menubar.
edit: The cursor keys and Enter then allow you to navigate, drill-down and ultimately select an item - just as you can on Windows.
also - can't claim credit for this, I learnt it here on the site! What are your favorite Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts?

A: There are two approaches to try: Control ^F2 or Command ⌘Shift ⇧Slash /
Advantages compared of both solution:




Feature
Control ^F2
Command ⌘Shift ⇧Slash /




Starts on menu side
Left side
Right side


Starts on menu item

Help


Menu state is
Highlighted
Opened


Hand to use
Left hand
Right hand


Closer to arrow keys
no
yes


One hand operation
no
yes




Personally I prefer the second solution since it is closer to navigation arrow keys →←↑↓ and the menu is already opened and only one hand, ie. right hand ☜ is involved into the operation.
Note: Some menu options are altered while holding the Option ⌥ key!
