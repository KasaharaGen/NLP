Q: Can I install apps on iPhone/iPad from iTunes without syncing? Simple question: Can I install an application that was downloaded to my iTunes into my iPad/iPhone without syncing it with the computer?
I am abroad and without access to wi-fi, only network cable, so the trivial solutions of "download directly through the iPad" and "sync it with your computer once and be over it" won't work (unless I start syncing with two computers at the same time, and I recall it gave me trouble in the past).

A: You can try the install with iPhone Configuration Utility:

A: No. 
To install apps into your iPad you would need to:


*

*Install it via the App Store (on your iDevice)

*Sync it through iTunes


That is, if you don't jailbreak. However, I will not touch on the subject as it may break Apple's license for apps (and void your warranty).

A: You might be able to download the application (some applications have their own website so you dont have to use iTunes to download them) then drag it into your iPad.
