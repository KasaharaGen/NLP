Q: ERROR 1013 Restoring iPhone 4 I have a MacBook 2.4 Intel Core 2 Duo version 10.6.6 i updated the iTunes to the newest version 10.2.1 & and an iPhone 4 .. when i was updating to the newest software of the iPhone a error occurred 1013, i went to the apple store and they change my phone.. i came back to restore the iPhone again (the new one) and the same error happened is it my iTunes or my computer making my phone break down?

A: According to the Apple Support forums, it looks like a fix for this is to comment out gs.apple.com in your hosts file. 
Comment it out in /etc/hosts by doing the following (taken from that page):


*

*Open Finder

*Hold down COMMAND + SHIFT keys and press 'G'

*Enter "/private/etc/" in the field and press "Go"

*Find "hosts" file in the directory

*Drag the file to your desktop

*Open it in text editor

*Remove the line that has gs.apple.com entirely or put a # at the beginning of it to comment it out

*Save the file

*Drag it back to the /private/etc/ folder.

*You'd need to enter your username and password to authenticate the move
