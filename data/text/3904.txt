Q: Can I or can't I develop on a jailbreak iPhone? Does any one have a definitive answer?
I am reading so many answers that tell you both thing, one tells you that it is not a problem at all and the other one is very definite NO...Is there any developer over here that has a jailbreaked iPhone that is using it to test the application in development?
From what I heard from friends, Not over the web, Apple don't allow that and is checking for that, but over the web I've read that it is not a problem....
I will eventually remove the  jailbreak that was installed on my lovely iPhone, but I want to know if to do it now or can I wait with that because I want the person that installed it to remove it and give me the iPhone I asked for....never mind, if I can wait, I prefer to do it this way (might take weeks of month as we do not leave in the same place) but if I have to, I will do it by myself and that's all..

A: I've used my former lost jailbroken iPhone to develop, yes. But you'll need more than jailbreaking, though, granted, jailbreak is a must (except in very specific cases):

*Actually the only very rare specific exception I know of is the Unity 3D's amazing Remote - but that does (currently) limit phone features that can be tested. No gyroscope for instance.

*The regular way is hacking Xcode. Of course the limitation here is deploying: only with USB.

*Another way could be something like TestFlight - while I'm not sure this can be done without a proper developer license, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a way to do it Over the Air.

A: The jailbreak does not affect the functionality of the phone except to allow MORE things to run on it, so there's no reason to think it won't work for development.
