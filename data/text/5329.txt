Q: What is the upper limit of Spaces in Lion? 10.5 and 10.6 limited users to a maximum of 16 spaces. Since Lion's space interface is a single (presumably scrollable) row, is there an upper limit on the number of Spaces?
Yes, I find myself needing more than 16 Spaces, frequently. 

A: 16 spaces is still the maximum. (Tested on 10.7)
