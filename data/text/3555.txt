Q: Scripting environment setup When I start a session programming on my macbook pro, I have a bunch of apps I'd like open and ready:


*

*DevNull smtp java server (run from terminal with java -jar DevNull.jar)

*Terminal shell in the tomcat/bin directory with startup.sh;tail -f ../logs/catalina.out running after rm -rf work and test webapp directories

*IntelliJ running

*after tomcat loads (fine with just having a timer), Firefox with my webapp loaded

*after tomcat loads, Chrome with my webapp loaded

*ForkLift

*TextMate

*Couple of Finder windows open in particular directories


Those are pretty core...  then it depends on what exactly I'm working on as far as other apps I need open.
So how do I write a script I can double click on and have all the above ready for me, saving me a couple minutes each day and being a little less annoying getting started?  Is there a nice app that can easily do the above for me?  Do I need to write a bash or python script for this? Or learn applescript?

A: I'd use a bash script for this as everything that you list can be opened in bash.  Use the open command pointing to the application to run the application or a folder location to open a particular folder with finder.

A: I use Concentrate to load up apps relevant to whatever I'm doing right now - you can run terminal commands, Applescripts, load programs, etc. I hit 'concentrate', make some tea, and then return to everything running. I know I could do this with Automator, but I'm too lazy to learn how.
