Q: The Apple TV 2 has 110V/220V PSU or just 110V? I'm going to the USA, and I am planning to buy an Apple TV there for use it in Europe.
Why I should do that?
Because the $99 Apple TV is sold in Europe for â‚¬120 ($170). Why pay almost the double for the same stuff?
OK, so the core question: is the internal Apple TV 2 PSU 110V/220V, or just 110V for units sold in the USA?

A: This US Apple Store webpage says that the current Apple TV (2) has:

Power: Built-in 6-watt universal power supply

So yes, it looks like it will be fine in Europe.

A: Yes, according to Apple TV on Apple Online Store description page, the power is a Built-in 6-watt universal power supply. 
But another important thing needs to check is to see if the power plug matches the socket in your country. 

A: I bought it and I confirm that the US version works fine with european 220V/50hz (fine print on the box says also 110V/220V compatibility)

A: Yes it works 100%. I used an old figure 8 cable, ran it straight from 220V 50Hz socket and the Apple TV worked great.
