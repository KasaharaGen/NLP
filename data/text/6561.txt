Q: Can I set priority for certain start-up services? I've set up a Synergy client on my copy of Lion. I have configured it to auto-start on login and for my computer to auto-login. However, it takes about 2-3 minutes for the Synergy service to finally run and connect to my Windows server. Is there any way to set the priority of this service?
