Q: How do I deauthorize all computers on iTunes? In older versions of iTunes (for Windows at least), there used to be a way to Deauthorize all computers associated with an account. 
Now it appears the only option in 10 (10.1.2.17) is to Deauthorize this computer... and removes only the one I'm on. Has the option to Deauthorize All disappeared or has it been moved somewhere else?
My reason behind needing this: One of the authorized computers had a hard drive failure and I just wanted to clean up the computers I have authorized.

A: From this Apple Support article you can do it from your account.

If you find you have reached 5 authorizations, you can reset your authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All in the Account Information screen.

The process works as follows

  
*
  
*Click iTunes Store in the menu on the left side of iTunes.
  
*If you're not signed in to the store, click the Account button, then enter your account name and password.
  
*Click the Account button again (your ID appears on the button), enter your password, and then click View Account.
  
*In the Account Information window, click Deauthorize All.
  


Also note the following:

You may only use this feature once per year. The Deauthorize All button will not appear if you have fewer than 5 authorized computers, or if you have used this option within the last 12 months. If you need assistance on using this feature please contact iTunes Store support via email.
