Q: Is iOS 4.1 faster than iOS 4.0 on the iPhone 3G? There are numerous questions (and good answers!) about the fact that iOS 4.0 is horribly slow on an iPhone 3G. 
How about iOS 4.1? Does anybody have any positive experiences to share? I'm staying on 3.1.3 for a long time still, or until any new v4.x isn't any slower. 

A: The rumours are that it is much faster: http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/07/27/does-ios4-1-fix-slow-iphone3g-units-yes/
