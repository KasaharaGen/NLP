Q: How can I extract the audio from a video file? I have a video of a music performance that I downloaded online, and want to extract the audio so that I can store it as a music file. It's a MOV file with the Codecs - "XVID, MPEG Layer 3." What software should I use for best results?

A: I can't tell you about best results, but for some results:
VLC, FFMPEG, or MPLAYER
VLC has a GUI and a Wizard. ffmpeg and mplayer example here.

A: If it is a MOV file which you can open with QuickTime Player, open it QuickTime Player 7, an optional install in Snow Leopard, and then go to File -> Export, and choose Sound to AIFF for instance. The resulting AIFF file can me converted back to MP3 or AAC with iTunes, for instance.

A: Wound up using Audio Hijack Pro for this, was incredibly simple.
