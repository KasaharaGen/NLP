Q: Remove extra icons on startup I used to have two iMacs running Lion connected to each other via Firewire.
On starting up a computer, two icons representing both computers would appear. I would select one and type in the password.
Now I have sold one of the computers but both icons still appear on start-up, requiring me to choose one.
How do I eliminate the unnecessary start-up icon?
