Q: How much current/power can be drawn from iPhone 30-pin connector? How much current/power can be drawn from iPhone 30-pin connector by external devices?
I googled it and failed to find some definitive answer for this. some say 50-100mA.
Update: I am aware of MFi program from Apple. Does it mean one must register before getting the official hardware specifications regarding 30-pin connector?

A: Somewhere around 160 mA.
Kineteka sells a 30 pin breakout board and pin 18 supplies the 3.3 volts. I just connected a 500 ohm pot between pin 18 and ground and lowered the resistance while measuring the current. It tops out around 160 mA. Try it!
EDIT:
Kineteka has closed but here are some similar 30 pin breakout boards with which I have no experience: http://www.pc-mobile.net/iphone.htm

A: I don't know in general, but after iOS 4.2 the maximum current you can obtain through the Apple camera connection kit it's just 20 mA.

A: It's just my personal experience, but I have successfully run an xBee 1 mW module off the iPad (and a 5th generation iPod nano. I did my testing with the nano, cause it's cheaper to replace if I damaged something).
1 mW xBee radios have a claimed current draw of 50 mA.
Sparkfun also have a iPhone-connector GPS, which has a current draw of 75 mA.
