Q: How can I prevent the iCloud dialog from showing up for new users? On 10.7.2, whenever a new account is created, and the person logs in for the first time, they see the iCloud system pref pane.
Is there a way to prevent this from showing up?

A: From a Terminal window:

sudo defaults write /System/Library/User\Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SetupAssistant DidSeeCloudSetup -bool TRUE
