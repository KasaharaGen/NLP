Q: "Could not find RubyGem rails" on 10.7.1 Server I just cannot get Rails to work on my 10.7.1 Server installation. After having run CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 gem install rails --force as root, I still get this:
% rails
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:777:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem rails (>= 0) (Gem::LoadError)
  from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:211:in `activate'
  from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:1056:in `gem'
  from /usr/bin/rails:18

RVM doesn't appear to be producing a working install either.
To cap it all, this lack of Rails is preventing Profile Manager from running.
Does anybody know what could be going wrong here? I've tried a clean install of 10.7 (not Server, though) on another machine, and Rails runs fine in that. I'm not particularly keen on nuking and reinstalling my main system, though!

A: Try upgrading rubygems or try uninstalling rails and installing back again using gems.

gem update --system 
gem uninstall rails
gem install rails
