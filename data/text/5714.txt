Q: Is there a minimum running configuration for OS X? I'd like to run just the bare essentials in Lion while I read up on what is new, where the docs are, and how to lock it down.
Is there a base set or 'stripped down' list of apps that I could run while adding more as I see fit?
EDIT:  8GB Ram, core 2 duo LP64 Kernel. Before I asked this question I installed 2x, over top of Snow Leopard, then on a clean drive.
One of the solutions:
I did the NVRAM, the SMC, single user fsck, bootstrapped launchd, dumped memory ( the diagnostic tools are nice. )
Hardware and memory checked out fine.  Oddly, it did not even show a lot of load. That's quite odd because the fans blast spin up and then POP ... kernel panic. Full speed for hours.  But I found the culprit:

I had servermgrd from the very beginning.  You get more services with server app, not some. Flush the ruleset? Why not? Process clearly had something to say!

Really, the menu option to restore windows was quite sufficient. It saves iTerm states too. Why would I want this? Rebooting means something went wrong, I want to wake up from the nightmare, not relive it.

The "change" was me finally realizing the common factor, and shutting off the network.

Crash. fsck and reading the serveradmin manpage in the empty void of single user mode.
But turning off en1 or en0 or the unseen Bluetooth DUN that does not show up(!) in the gui. give one time to run this:
<=(serveradmin list)  parallel serveradmin stop {}
Got me out of it ( zsh FTW, and I prefer parallel to xargs ). Now, I tried that earlier, but did not have success.  Those were the services I wanted to stop, now the OS is no longer wrecking my hardware.
This was a totally clean install. To be fair, I installed the first time before the supplemental 10.6.8 patches, maybe its a finicky upgrade path. Who knows...

A: Mac OS isnt quite like Windows or Linux in that aspect, you cant run a "bare bones" version of Lion, nor a "Starter" version. Mac OS X Lion comes in a single version with all features.
As of minimum system requirements, Apple is pretty straight forward with that too. You need a mac with Intel Core 2 Duo at least. You also need 2GB of RAM, but I'd say most macs with a Core 2 Duo already have that covered. If not you can upgrade your memory. 
To check your hardware click on the Apple Menu, select About This Mac, and then More Info.
As for apps, most apps just require you to be running a certain OS. Usually just games or heavy professional apps require minimum processor speeds/RAM memory.
For more info on Lion's Specs, go ahead and check:

Hope its useful.
