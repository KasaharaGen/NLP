Q: Vimperator Style Extension for Safari 5? Do we have a Vimperator style extension for Safari 5?

A: Not really. I've been hoping for a good one, but I keep coming back to Firefox and Pentadactyl, a Vimperator fork.
Safari does have Vimlike and Vim Keybindings, but Vimperator and Pentadactyl are miles ahead in terms of features. If all you're looking for is Vim-style movement and the ability to follow links from the keyboard, those should do the trick, but I miss a lot of the deeper features that Pentadactyl offers: javascript evaluation, quicklinks, ability to yank links from the keyboard, and much, much more.

A: Vimari also offers some of the keyboard shortcuts from Pentadactyl.  

A: An old question, but it seems that the plugin sVim does a decent job now.

A: I found the extensions by Daniel Bergey useful: http://dbergey.github.com/

A: Have a Look at: https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim 
It's similar to cVim for Chrome.
