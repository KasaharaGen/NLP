Q: How do I show hidden files in Finder with a keyboard shortcut? What is Ubuntu's CTRL+H equivalent in OSX Lion Finder to toggle display hidden files?
My all searches point me to use: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE which is not exactly the same and its effect is somewhat permanent.

A: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE reverse it. And there is no such functionality (online hide/show without restart) built in into Finder.
That is probaly because anyone who need it will prefer ls -a anyway.)
BTW If you only need to list hidden files use ls -ld .??*

A: There is a simple keyboard shortcut, at least since Sierra (macOS 10.12). Ensure that Finder is the active app and use this keyboard shortcut: 
CommandShift. (that's a full stop/period at the end)

A: You could buy TotalFinder. It is a finder replacement that supports this feature (and many other nice features like tabs). TotalFinder features the ⇧⌘. shortcut as seen here:

See more details about this particular feature on their site

A: The keyboard shortcut
CommandShift.
does not work with international keyboards in Finder window, although it works in "open file" dialogs.
At least this is true with French keyboard.
The shortcut to use then is
fnCommandShift.
It works in both "open file" dialogs and in Finder windows, however you can avoid pressing the extra key fn and use CommandShift. in those dialogs.

A: ⇧⌘. shows hidden files in file dialogs and in some third party applications like TotalFinder. Transmit also has a menu item for toggling hidden files, but it's assigned to ⇧⌘B by default.
There's nothing equivalent to that in Finder though. But you could assign a shortcut to a script like this with FastScripts or by creating an Automator service.
k="com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"
[[ "$(defaults read $k)" == 0 ]] && b=true || b=false
defaults write $k -bool $b
osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"' && open -a Finder



A: Wow, the above sounds really complex, why not open a terminal, and


*

*type defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES and press return

*Now Ctrl-Opt-Click on the Finder icon and select Relaunch


To un-hide run defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO the same way.

A: Here's a tutorial for setting up a contextual menu item to toggle visibility of hidden files.

Still not as good as a keyboard shortcut. Filing a duplicate of radar://7096650 at http://bugreport.apple.com is the best way to tell Apple that you want this feature.
