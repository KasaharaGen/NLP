Q: OS X in VM Ware or Virtual Box Is it possible to run OS X in VM Ware? I want to setup a virtualized OS X for testing instead of going to buy another mac. Can I do that technically and legally?
To be explicit I do own a mac already.

A: You can do it technically. Legally I think you can do it if a) The VM is on Mac hardware and b) you purchase a unique disk (license) for the OS in the VM.
