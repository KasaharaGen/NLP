Q: how to delete characters placed next to cursor on MacBook Pro I have recently shifted from PC to Mac and from what I recall on PC keyboards, there are keys where you can delete characters placed before your cursor as well as after cursor. I don't recall what the later is called.
I can't find something equivalent for Mac to delete post cursor characters.

A: For forward delete, hold down fn (the function key) and press delete.

A: Laptop keyboards and Apple Wireless Keyboards use fn+delete ⌫ for forward delete. Keyboards with a numeric keypad have a separate delete ⌦ key like on other platforms.
