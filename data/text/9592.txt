Q: DVI-D to Thunderbolt - new Mac Mini I am buying a new Mac Mini that has one of these new Thunderbolt ports to connect to monitors. I know that this Thunderbolt port is equivalent to mini Display Port. My monitor is a Samsung 2232BW+ that has one of this DVI-D Single Link connectors. See next picture:

but all adapters I find are like this:

all informations I find, say that my monitor is DVI-D Single Link but the adapter is said to be DVI DUAL link.
Looking at both connectors, I see that in theory a DVI-D cable can connect to the DVI dual link, but I want to be sure.
Will it work if I buy one of these connectors in the second picture to use with my DVI-D monitor? Or what other cable do you recommend to connect a new mac mini with a thunderbolt port to a DVI-D monitor?
thanks.

A: Yes, that will work just fine.  Notice that the female DVI connector has more slots than the male connector has pins.  Those slots are for the extra pins needed by a dual link cable.  They're not needed for a single link DVI connection, so they'll just sit unused.
