Q: What is the best compression utility for Mac? What compression utility can you recommend that supports zip, rar, tar, etc... like 7zip and FilZip on Windows?

A: My personal recommendation is BetterZip for a small price and the ability to create archives. A free alternative is The Unarchiver but this is limited to archive extraction only.

A: Stuffit Expander is a good one that I hear a lot about. The built-in Archive Utility will hand just about every thing except for RAR files. For that I would use UnRARX, which is also free.

A: I like Archiver (formerly known as Rucksack). But it's not free.

A: I found Keka that is some different to use, but solve the problem. And Unarchiver is a good choice to decompress too.
Thanks all!
