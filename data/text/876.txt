Q: Is it possible to write to the Boot Camp disk in OS X? I have a MacBook Pro with Boot Camp and sometimes I want to update information on the Windows partition but currently I have to boot in Windows and read from the Mac partition.  I don't want to leave OS X to organize files.

A: It is possible.
You will first need MacFUSE and then NTFS-3G.
The User's Guide for NTFS-3G can be found here (PDF).
