Q: Starting Keynote presenter mode without an external monitor Before a talk, I'd like to try the presenter mode for Keynote - to get familiar with it - on my Macbook Pro, without an alternate display being attached.
Is this possible? How?

A: Keynote has this functionality built-in. In Keynote, go to the Play menu, then choose Rehearse Slideshow. You'll then have presenter mode on your single screen.

A: I don't have my adapter handy to test this, but you might be able to just plug the adapter in and have the MBP think it has a second monitor.
This definitely doesn't work with the mini display port to DVI adapter, but I seem to recall that it worked with a mini DVI to VGA adapter (or was it the DVI to VGA adapter?).
