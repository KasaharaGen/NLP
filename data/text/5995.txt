Q: Is there a way to upload a video from my iPhone to Google+? is there a way to upload video from iphone to Google+?
From iphone Google+ app we can upload photos but Video option is only available for Android yet

A: No, there's no way to do that yet. Using external apps won't help either since Google has not released a full API yet with those functions so far.
