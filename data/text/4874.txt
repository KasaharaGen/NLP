Q: front light blinking and beep sound Just two days back, I bought a MacBook Pro. I have just decreased the resolution of the display and started one game. Suddenly, my MacBook made an annoying beep sound and the front light was also blinking. After I restarted the system, everything seemed fine.
I just want to know what the problem was?
Edit: So the problem is reproducible. Whenever I start the game, the MacBook Pro starts flashing the front light and beeping.

A: You need to let us know how many times the light blinks, because they are diagnostic indicators. If it's blinking 3 times then pause, then 3 times again then it's an indication of a bad RAM. If it beeps 3 times, it's also an indication of bad ram.
However, if it blinks 5 times and pauses, then the battery might need diagnostics or replacing. So check.
