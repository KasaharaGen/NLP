Q: How do I get syntax highlighting of source code files within Quick Look back in Lion? Source code files viewed using Quick Look on Snow Leopard had syntax highlighting. Unfortunately the syntax highlighting has disappeared on OS X Lion. Is there a way to get it back?

A: I don't think Snow Leopard did that by default, you most likely had a QuickLook plugin installed, such as qlcolorcode or colorqc2. You can simply install this again in Lion.

A: Actually, Xcode 3.x included a Quicklook plugin for source codes. With the intruduction of Xcode 4.x, such plugin has disappeared. 
I have personallly tried to use qlcolorcode and colorqc2 on Lion, but both are not stable/reliable enough (slow response, sometimes missing quicklook). An updated version of the plugins would be welcome.

A: The Xcode 3 plugin was found at /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/SourceCode.qlgenerator
Unfortunately I don't think this can be made to work now. :(

A: Guys you can do this procedure bellow:
To fix this, open a new Terminal window and enter these commands to open vim’s configuration file:
$ cd /usr/share/vim
$ sudo vim vimrc

Press the i key to switch vim to Insertion Mode, then enter these lines below the set backspace=2 line:
set ai                  " auto indenting
set history=100         " keep 100 lines of history
set ruler               " show the cursor position
syntax on               " syntax highlighting
set hlsearch            " highlight the last searched term
filetype plugin on      " use the file type plugins

" When editing a file, always jump to the last cursor position
autocmd BufReadPost *
\ if ! exists("g:leave_my_cursor_position_alone") |
\ if line("'\"") > 0 && line ("'\"") <= line("$") |
\ exe "normal g'\"" |
\ endif |
\ endif

Press the ⎋ esc key to take vim out of Insertion Mode, then press : (colon) followed by x to save the file and exit.
It worked for me thanks.
