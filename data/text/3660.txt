Q: How can I keep certain apps from showing in the command-tab switcher? Pretty much self-explanatory... I just have a bunch of utilities (LaunchBar, DeliBar, Tags, etc...) that I never need to tab to and so are just in the way. 

A: If these applications offer the ability to Hide the Dock Item, and live only in the Menu Bar, then they will not show up in the Command+Tab switcher list. Review the preferences within each application to see if this feature is supported.
Last I knew, there were no stable solutions for hiding Dock Icons without adverse application affects.
I have numerous applications that live in the Menu Bar only, and most have an option to show it if necessary:
Alfred, Sparrow, iMenuMeters, Divvy, Last.fm, Flux, Little Snitch, and Tunnelblick.
