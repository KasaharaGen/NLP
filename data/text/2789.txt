Q: Can XNA & Visual Studio be run in VMware Fusion on Mac OS X? Is it possible to run XNA & Visual Studio from a machine under VMware Fusion running on Mac OS X?

A: I have done the setup before. You won't get hardware acceleration but the setup does work and if your not doing any work that requires hardware acceleration it should be fine.
I previously did demos for Tech-Ed on gaming development using this setup without any problems.
For hardware acceleration you will need to use Boot Camp.
