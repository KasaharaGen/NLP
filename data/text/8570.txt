Q: All apps that access the internet crash when opened I recently just bought a used Gen2 IPod.  It's worked fine until now.  When I left home, the wifi disconnected.  makes sense so far.  I clicked an online app while I was out so naturally, the app crashed (it was a texting app) right as it started to load the data from the web.  I have lots of these kinds of apps (different kinds of wiki things, etc.).  I've now come home to my sweat home and apparently (to my surprise) even after reconnecting the wifi (Safari works just fine), all of my apps that were connecting to the internet crash almost instantly.  
Why is this?  I'm officially stuck with Angry Birds (and I'm stuck so that isn't helpful).  Besides, Safari, none of my other web enabled apps work.  I can't text people.  I can't listen to my radio, etc.
I've restarted it numerous times to no avail.
Any help guys!?

A: What version of iOS are you running? Have you tried clearing your web history, cache, cookies, etc? Go to Settings -> Safari and click all the options to clear this data.

A: I found the solution (as odd as it was) from macrumers.
I installed a free app (just a random app) and now everything works!  Odd.
