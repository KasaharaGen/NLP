Q: iOS MobileMe Sync Hey does anyone know if there is a public framework to sync data between iOS devices using MobileMe?  I've tried googling it and have come up empty.

A: Basically, you could use MobileMe as a WebDAV server to sync your data OTA.
This is, for example, what Wallet uses.

A: I don't believe that there is yet. Apple have a MobileMe SDK on the desktop, but haven't released anything for iOS as yet. And if memory serves, I can't recall having seen any iOS apps that use MobileMe for syncing, beyond the built-in Calendar, AddressBook and Notes apps.
