Q: Google Hangouts with 10.6.8 and Firefox 8.0.1 I've been trying to use Google Hangouts in Firefox for a few weeks, but Firefox keeps asking me to install a plugin. I've installed the required plugin more than once, but the page behaves as if I haven't installed it.
I've tried installing the plugin with Firefox running and without it running, and I've rebooted the computer several times. It never worked.
It works well in Google Chrome and Safari, but I prefer Firefox.

A: I've just tried Google Hangouts my self - and it works with my FF 8.0.1 on OS X Lion - using Google Talk plugin v2.5.6.4871
