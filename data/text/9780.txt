Q: Why can't I acces my Mac's webserver from my iPhone using the Mac's ad-hoc WiFi? I want to do a demo of an iPhone optimised WebApp using my MacBook Air with a local server, so I don't have to depend on getting an internet connection or WiFi access from my client.
The Air is running Lion 10.7.2 and the iPhone is on iOS 5.0.1.
When I create a network on the Mac I can join from the iPhone, but when I open "http://my-macbook-air/" in Safari, it doesn't work.
Strangely it doesn't seem to utilize the WiFi, as the indicator never appears (but shows connected in the Settings app).

Why is my iPhone unable to connect to an ad hoc wifi network? (though my question is Apple <-> Apple, so I expected it to work).

A: It is probably related to resolving the host name.
Try using the IP address of the Mac instead of the name:


A: I followed the steps here: http://egalo.com/2012/05/29/testing-mac-web-site-using-local-hostname-on-mobile-device/ 
It took about 5 minutes to setup and works really well.

A: Not sure if the firewall rules apply to an ad-hoc network, but I spent days with both the apache server and python's SimpleHTTPServer without being able to connect my iphone up, although i was able to connect the iPhone to a windows box running SimpleHTTPServer.  It ended up simply being the MAC OS firewall.  Turn it off in System Preference -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall.  It blocks incoming connections.
