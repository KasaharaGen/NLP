Q: Remove backup on Windows PC iTunes Now that iCloud is available, I don't need to backup my iPad to my Windows PC. Is it possible to remove backups from my PC or do I have to uninstall iTunes?

in Windows XP, the location is
C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup

in Windows Vista, Windows 7:
