Q: Repairing an iPhone screen I've got a broken screen on my iPhone 4.  Does anyone have any hints, suggestions, or products that you have used to repair your broken screen?  Is there anything different about the iPhone 4 vs other iOS devices (due to the Gorilla Glass)?

A: I would suggest the iFixIt kit and guide. It's gonna be expensive since unlike of the  the previous versions iPhone, on iPhone4 you can't just change the glass without the changing LCD..

A: You probably have your IPhone fixed or replaced by now, but maybe others will find this useful. 
I faced the same problem last Sunday - IPhone 4 glass shattered in thousand places after being dropped on the floor. We used iFixYourI to replace the screen assembly - they have a location in Boston, and it only took 20 minutes + about $130. On iPhone4 only the entire glass + digitizer + LCD assembly can be replaced. I would suggest googling "iphone 4 screen replacement" to see your local outlets first; if nothing is available nearby iFixYourI or others will still accept your phone by mail; Finally, if you want to DIY  then screen assemblies can now be purchased now for less than $100.
Hope this helps.
