Q: Snow leopard server: use a NAS volume as share point I have a mounted nas volume (/Volumes/Volume_1) and i would like to create a share point on this, so that it can be accessed via FTP or whatever.
Yet, when in server admin > file sharing, I cannot see this volume.
Is there anything I can do to see my NAS volume?
PS: that's a shame, I wanted to tag my post snow-leopard-server... because I thought it made sense... but it's not possible until I earn these 150 reputations :)

A: Mac OS X Server does allow the resharing of AFP mounts but not SMB/CIFS mounts. You can however get around it by using a symlink (ln -s /Volumes/Volume_1 /SOME/PATH) and share /SOME/PATH. While both options allow it to work it's not recommended (permissions, resource fork handling, max file size, etc. may cause hard to debug issues).
Alternatively on the command line you can use sharing (eg. sudo sharing -a path -s shareflags)
