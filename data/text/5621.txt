Q: Mission Control Animation I've install Lion on both MBP17 2008 and iMac27 i7 2010. On the old MBP, Mission Control animation are smooth but on the iMac, the desktop slide away with a nice animation but then all the application window appear in a snap with no animation at all.  Is there a way to turn this feature on again ?
