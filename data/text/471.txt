Q: How do I erase an iPhone? I had an iPhone on loan from a friend to try it out and now I need to give it back. How do I make sure that everything is erased from it? SMS, Calendar, Phone Logs, contacts? 

A: You can achieve this with a restore in iTunes.  It will restore the iPhone to it's factory state, after which you can optionally restore from a backup.  Here is a summary and guide from Apple on the subject.

A: To erase everything and restore the iPhone to the factory state, go into Settings, then General, then Reset. Press "Erase All Content and Settings". If you have a passcode, you will be prompted to enter it. Select "Erase iPhone" and the wipe will begin. Be sure to have your iPhone connected to a power source as the erase takes a long time. When it's complete, the iPhone will have no SMS, calendar, phone logs, contacts, etc.
