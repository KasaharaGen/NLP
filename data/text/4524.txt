Q: Optimal keyboard shortcut for keyboard layout switching on OS X? Considering that Spotlight is already using ⌘+space and that you cannot use combination of modifiers alone, I would like to see an ergonimic alternative.
I can't use the following combinations due to conflicts with other software


*

*ctrl+space - auto-complete in IDEA


A: I use ctrl + ⌥ + space. It's typeable via left hand, doesn't collide with the search window shortcut (as ⌥ + ⌘ + space does) and I haven't found any other overlap yet.

A: I'm using ⌥ + ⌘ + space as it doesn't trigger autocomplete in Eclipse, Idea or Quicksilver/Spotlight/Alfred.

A: How about ctrl + ` (backtick)
Easy to type that with your left hand.

A: I use ctrl + space which is may be the best option I found out to be useful and ergonomic.

A: I use ⌘+⌥+C to trigger my clipboard manager.
I haven't found it overlapping any other keyboard shortcut, and the keys are close enough to be pressed using one hand (the thumb for the modifiers and the index for "C")

A: I use ⌘+⇧+\ (next to Enter). Works fine for me.

A: What's wrong with the default ⌘+⇥? (or ⌥+⌘+⇥ to switch in the opposite order)?
It's perfectly ergonomic to have your thumb on the ⌘ key and use on of your others to press the ⇥ key.

A: I use ctrl+⌥+⌘ for "global" keyboard shortcuts.
ctrl+⌥+⌘ +S seems like a good "switch" shortcut.
You could probably also use ⌥+F[1-12] key if you install Apptivate [$3 on the Mac App Store].

A: I've always been using Cmd+Alt+/ and been pretty happy with it. I don't remember having any conflict with any app.

A: I use caps lock to switch language. 1 keystroke.  You can set this in system preferences/keyboard/input sources:

Unfortunately this only works if you are switching between a Latin input source and non-Latin input source like Russian, Greek, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, etc.
