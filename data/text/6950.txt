Q: Details of the proxy address which is being used by Mac Is it possible to get the proxy address that my system is currently using in order to populate HTTP_PROXY variable from command line ?
I would like a command so that I could set it in my .bashrc file.
complete solution for me was to update my .bashrc file with this 
function http_proxy { 
    export http_proxy=`networksetup -getwebproxy Wi-Fi  | head -3 | tail -2  | cut -f2 -d' ' | sed 'N;s/\n/:/'|grep -v ':0'`
}
alias homen="networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi '' ;http_proxy"
alias ofcn="networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi proxy.examp.com 8080;http_proxy"
http_proxy


A: Either get ProxyConf, which does exactly this.
Or retrieve the web proxy with networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet (replace Ethernet with the one you're using from networksetup -listallnetworkservices), then format the output into HTTP_PROXY format:
$ networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet | awk '/Server:/ {host=$2} /Port: / {port=$2} END { printf "http://%s:%s", host, port}'
http://127.0.0.1:8228

If your network services (Ethernet, Wifi, etc.) vary or you use multiple at the same time, you may need to get a little more elaborate to figure out which one is being used. man networksetup and man ifconfig should have everything you need if you want to go there.
Formerly there was also scselect, but networksetup incorporates all of it's functionality.
