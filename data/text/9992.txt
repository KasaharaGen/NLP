Q: The iPhone could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (9) This is an issue that occurred to my iPhone.
What is the recommended general fix for this?

A: I was able to fix this issue by plugging my iPhone into another Windows machine, then placing the iPhone back onto the original machine, then doing a restore on the iPhone.

A: I had this error occur today when attempting to update my iPhone 4 to iOS5.  I'm using the latest iTunes (10.5) on Windows 7.  Here's how I resolved it:


*

*Disconnected all devices from my computer except the iPhone and rebooted the laptop

*Put the iPhone in Airplane mode, then cycle the power (power down, power back up)

*Connect the iPhone and restart the update in iTunes


A: Re-try again, then run Console for any further details.
For advanced solution try to Download and install OS X USB Debug Kits which will provide more information about USB device and interface detection, driver and interface matching, driver loading and information generated as a result of normal and abnormal conditions.
