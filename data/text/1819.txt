Q: How can I automatically start the Safari Reader? Is there a way to tell Safari to automatically use Reader when it recognizes an article which it is able to display with Reader?
Right now I have to manually click the Reader button at the right side of the address bar.

A: I've tried to figure this out myself, and haven't yet come up with a way to load safari-resource:/Reader.html programmatically.
If necessary, I fall back to Readability, the 3rd-party Safari add-on Apple used as their basis for Reader. Combined with Safari Stand, I can modify the appearance of pages when they load.

A: Try CMD + SHFT + R to save the effort of the precision mouse motion.

A: I've built a Safari extension for this. Download it from here:
