Q: Safari reopens last open tabs? On Lion, if I quit Safari using  ⌘ Command+Q and then restart it, it reopens all tabs from last time.
In Preferences, I have set that new Windows open with an Empty Page, a setting that worked fine in Snow Leopard.
Is there a way to disable that nonsense? I can't seem to find a setting for this :(

A: In case you didn't have the foresight to shut down with a special command, you can always hold down Shift when starting Safari (or any other Resume-able app) to prevent it from restoring the previous state.

A: In addition to the great ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+Q tip, another way to think about it: If you always close all your tabs (⌘ Command+W) before you quit, there won't be any state to save. Then when you restart Safari, you'll get your preference of a blank page, home page, etc.

A: This is a new feature in Mac OS X Lion. See here (Resume).
You can disable this in System Preferences > General and untick the "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps, but will be system wide.
Another solution is to hold ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+Q when quitting,  the app will then not save the state.

A: Note that as per this other answer to a similar question, is is actually possible to disable resume on a per-app basis, forcing Safari to start with a new window and as such take your 'empty page' preference into account.
