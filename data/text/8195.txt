Q: How can I select all in a Google doc with an iPad? I created a new Google doc on my iPad2. When I select all to copy the whole contents, it only selects the current line.
Is there a known workaround for this?

A: Try putting the google docs into desktop mode. Click the Desktop link  at the bottom of the page.

View in: Mobile | Desktop

Then select edit menu in Google docs then "Select all"
