Q: Is there a good, full-featured EPUB to PDF converter? There are tons of PDF to EPUB converters but almost no EPUB TO PDF.
Only thing I've found is a free online converter (takes some time to upload, lacks the cover and the sidebar navigation) and a shareware (that I couldn't get to work). 

A: Does Calibre work? It offers Ebook Format Conversion for a lot of formats, quote from the FAQ:

Calibre supports the conversion of many input formats to many output formats. It can convert every input format in the following list, to every output format.
Input Formats: CBZ, CBR, CBC, CHM, DJVU, EPUB, FB2, HTML, HTMLZ, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDF, PRC, PDB, PML, RB, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ
Output Formats: EPUB, FB2, OEB, LIT, LRF, MOBI, HTMLZ, PDB, PML, RB, PDF, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ


A: You can try Go4ePub.com. 
According to my experience the results are slightly better than with Calibre.
