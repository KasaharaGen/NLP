Q: Using three-finger drag and three-finger back on browser For OS X Lion 10.7, is there a way that I can use three-finger drag and still be able to use gestures to swipe "back" in Firefox or Chrome?
I've found out how to do one or the other, but not both.

A: You cannot use both. Maybe a third-party app will come along to support it or it may in the future, but not now.

A: You might want to try going into system prefs -> mouse (or trackpad) -> more gestures, and use this arrow (picture below) to change the default options for gestures.
