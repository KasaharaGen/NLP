Q: Change PHP $PATH setting? How to change PHP $PATH setting?  
I am using MAMP 2.x, my terminal for PHP command is already set to the MAMP PHP 5.3.x, but now I want to change to PHP 5.2.x
I have done this before, but i forget the location of the file.

A: I found it, it located at /etc/paths we can edit it from terminal with this code
sudo nano /etc/paths
