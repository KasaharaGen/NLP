Q: Target Display Mode + Teleport with Thunderbolt iMac and Mac mini running Lion I've set up Screen Sharing, so I can see Teleport is working... But I can't get it to work if I use Target Display Mode. 
Here's what I tried:


*

*⌘+F2 with Teleport's mouse on the iMac.

*⌘+F2 with Teleport's mouse on the Mac mini.


Just doesn't work...
Any ideas?
