Q: If I upgrade to lion, will FCS 2 still work? I've noticed that a lot of different people have been asking, "If I upgrade to lion, will this program work?". So I guess lion isn't very compatible? Here's my question: Will FCS 2 work with lion? FCS 2 includes:


*

*Final Cut Pro 6

*Motion 3

*Color 1

*Soundtrack Pro 3

*DVD Studio Pro 3

*Compressor 3



Don't tell me to upgrade to Final Cut X; It is junk compared to this.

A: As far as I can tell, Final Cut Studio 2 will run on Lion, but will not install on Lion. Apparently, the installer program requires Rosetta, but the software itself does not. So yes, it should work, if it never needs reinstallation, but if it does, you're stuck. Proceed with caution.
