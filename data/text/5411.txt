Q: Cannot connect iPhone 4 to iMac after Lion upgrade I upgraded my 2009 model iMac to Lion yesterday. I can no longer connect my iPhone in order to synchronize with iTunes. Additionally, if I connect it to the USB port on my wired keyboard, it is also no longer charging the phone. The only way I can charge the phone now is if I use one of the USB ports at the back. Prior to the upgrade I had absolutely no issues using the keyboard USB port for this.
Can anyone offer any hints/tips to assist with troubleshooting this?

A: I manually downloaded and re-installed iTunes 10.4 from the Apple website, and this has appeared to have fixed the problem. iTunes is recognizing my iPhone, and I can once again use the USB port on my iMac's keyboard.
