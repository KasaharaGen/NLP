Q: How Many Genius Mixes Are There in iTunes? Every so often I'll add a couple hundred new songs to my iTunes and discover a new mix has been created. It makes me wonder then, exactly how many mixes are there, what genres are they, etc.
Here's a photo, in case you're unsure what I'm talking about.


A: Most macs with screens less than 27 inches get a maximum of 12 Genius Mix playlists if you have genius turned on in the view.
There are clearly more than 50 genres on the iTunes store and I've easily seen more than 20 mixes on various people's libraries. I'm not sure if Apple has disclosed how this is curated or how many categories are possible at any point in time.
You can remove a certain list to make room for another Mix by right-clicking on an existing mix icon. As you add more music and the genius updates, you may get a new mix when it can identify enough music in one of the mix categories.


A: 
We can crowd source this:
  
  
*
  
*Please type very carefully. Don't split combinations that use "&" or
  "/"- just list them as you see them. Do remove the word "Mix" from the
  end.
  
*If you have Brit Pop and Brit Pop 2, add in ( 2 ) or ( 2 3 ) if
  you have more than one mix with the same name.
  

These mixes have been observed already "in the wild."
