Q: Mac Mini Server... Can I wipe it clean and use non-server edition? As the title says. I have a Mac Mini server--I bought it because I liked the lack of a optical drive. I don't really care to use the software, and now having to spend an additional $50 on Lion's "Server" add-on is meh. 
Can I wipe the machine clean and install a fresh 10.7, non-server edition?

A: Yes.  I am currently using a late 2009 Mac mini Server with both Snow Leopard and Lion (non-server editions).

A: I went the route of loading the InstallESD.dmg file onto a USB thumb drive and booting from it (holding down the option key). This worked like a charm. No issues/unusual steps due it the system having 10.6 Server installed beforehand.
The directions I followed are from here: http://mashable.com/2011/07/20/lion-clean-install-guide/#20859Step-1-Download-Lion-From-the-Mac-App-Store

A: I'm only after seeing this post. I don't have time at the minute to answer it properly but if you haven't found a solution yet let me know and I'll give you all the details.
I had a 2009 MacMini SL Server. I tried to upgrade it to Lion Server and it upgraded but no server function worked properly and it was as slow as a dog.
I EVENTUALLY wiped the RAID disks and successfully installed Lion and then Server on top of it. It was much faster and the server functions worked just fine.
It's a little tricky but by no means Rocket Science.
Just let me know.
