Q: Can my Mac tell jokes? Sometimes I just need a break from serious work. Can my Mac OS install tell me any jokes? 

A: Why yes, it can, as a matter of fact. Follow these steps to hear some high quality jokes on your Mac.


*

*Open up Speech Recognition in your system settings. 

*Enable "Speakable Items"

*Enable "Speak Command Acknowledgement"


Set up the rest however you like (in regards to key press or keyword for input). When you're ready, say "Tell me a joke." (Or, if you have a keyword " tell me a joke".)
Enjoy! (Tested in Lion, although this has been around for quite some time.)

A: I vaguely recall a way to see (not hear) a joke in Terminal … maybe from before Mac OS X. 
I paged through Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X? but can't find anything relating to jokes …
