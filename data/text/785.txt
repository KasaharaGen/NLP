Q: Downgrading iPhone 3G 4.1 to 3.X or 2.X my iPhone 3G with iOS 4.1 is really slow and I am tired of this stupid situation. I am considering downgrading somehow to old 3.X or even 2.X versions, so it can breath again. What do you think? How would yo do it and to what iOs version?
Thanks

A: Firstly, if you don't use spotlight (the search screen when you swipe right from Home) you can turn that off which should increase the performance of the iPhone.
Settings>General>Spotlight Search and then deselect all of the options.
If you still want to downgrade....
The iPhone isn't really designed to downgrade but there are ways to do it. 
I had to down grade from the 4.0beta to 3.1.3 and followed this guide on The Unofficial Apple Weblog.
