A: You can go to this website and download the correct firmware file to your computer. From there, plug your iPhone into your computer and shift-click (Windows) or option-click (Mac) the "Restore" button. From there, choose the firmware file your downloaded.

A: You can view information on jailbreaking iOS devices at Jailbreak Matrix and they include links to past firmware
