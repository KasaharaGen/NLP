Q: Can an iPhone be restored from an iPod Touch backup? If I have an iPod Touch backup on my computer, can an iPhone restore from it? How about vice versa?

A: According to this forums post, somebody did it with success.

Worked flawlessly for me
  I just activated my new iPhone 3GS and then iTunes offered to either set it up as a new iPhone or to restore it from my iPod Touch backup which I did. No problems so far...


A: Yes, i can confirm this Works based on my experience. All my music and contacts from my iPod touch was magically restored to the iPhone 4S.

A: It will depends only of the iOS version, because the Apple's script is not accepting iOS minor than 8 right now (That's called downgrade). But if want to make an "Upgrade" (or restore from a version to the same version) so you have no problem with that, even with different devices.
