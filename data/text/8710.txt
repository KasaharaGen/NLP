Q: Google Chrome weird crash im using Google Chrome for years and i never experienced like this before.
im using chrome for a while without problems(several tabs open), then i open a new tab and google disables everything. can't close tab, can't open new tab. but i can change between tabs.
is there anyone have a problem like this before ?
