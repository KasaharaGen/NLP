Q: iMac and MacBook Pro Memory Specifications i am about to purchase an iMac mid 2011 2.7 i5 that comes with 4 GB of ram preinstalled. I  also have an mid 2009 macbook pro 13.3 2.26 computer. I wonder if i can install the 4gb ram of the iMac to my MBP?  
Is this possible?
If no, why?  
Thank you

A: According to Apple's support page the Mid 2009 MBP has 1066 MHz DDR3 Ram while the Early 2011 iMac has 1333 Mhz DDR3 Ram. The Pin number is the same.
According to this thread in the Macrumors forum 1333 DDR3 Ram can be installed on the MBP with DDR3 Ram, but would only be clocked at 1066 MHz.
