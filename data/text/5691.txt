Q: How do I get the iTunes play control widget back in Dashboard? In OS X 10.7 Lion, the iTunes dashboard widget from 10.6 Snow Leopard is no longer on the dashboard, I can't find a method of adding it again, it doesn't appear to be listed.
I frequently used this to control play/pause and track forward back.

A: You can download it here.
