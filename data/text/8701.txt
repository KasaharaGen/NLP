Q: Jailbroken iPad enters safe mode while Wi-Fi syncing When I arrive at my house, I manually start Wi-Fi Sync (Settings > General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync > Sync Now) to back up my data. But sometimes my iPad crashes into Safe Mode during this process. 
I looked through the error log (Settings > General > About > Diagnostics & Usage > Data > LatestCrash.plist) and it was constantly referring to libsystem_kernel.dylib, which is making me think that this might be caused by my tethered jailbreak. 
Does anyone else have this problem, and does anyone know how to fix it?
