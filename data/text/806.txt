Q: How can I map a middle click to control click? Just started to use a Mac for my new job and not being able to use the middle button to open links in a new tab is killing me. I know I can press control and do a regular click but it's not the same. I know the Mac knows I'm trying to do something because it beeps at me when I press the middle button on my mouse. Is there any hope?  
Note I tried the trick about setting expose dashboard to - but it didn't work.

A: Try holding the Command button instead. A Command click is a middle click. Control clicks give you a right click.
What kind of Mac? If you're using a Magic Mouse you can use a program like MagicPrefs to turn a three finger click into a Command click. If you're using the Magic Trackpad or the built-in trackpad on a MacBook/MacBook Pro there is a program called MiddleClick I've used that adds a three finger tap/click ability to map to the Command click.

A: Karabiner can be used to map mouse buttons. I haven't tested the following but it should be something like:
    {
      "description": "MouseButton3 to Ctrl+MouseButton1",
      "manipulators": [
        {
          "type": "basic",
          "from": {
            "pointing_button": "button3",
            "modifiers": {
              "optional": [
                "caps_lock"
              ]
            }
          },
          "to": [
            {
              "pointing_button": "button1"
              "modifiers": [
                "control"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

If you want to limit this mapping to the browser, something like the following in the manipulators block should do it:
          "conditions": [
            {
              "type": "frontmost_application_if",
              "bundle_identifiers": ["^com\\.google\\.Chrome$"]
            }
          ],
