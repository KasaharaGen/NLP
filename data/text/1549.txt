Q: FM Tuner for iPod Touch Is there a way to add (or even enable) a FM tuner for the iPod Touch? The only thing stopping me from getting one is the missing FM tuner. By the way, I need the FM tuner to listen to TV shows at the gym (they transmit the sound through a FM transmitter). So I cannot replace the FM tuner by Pandora.

A: I don't know for sure whether the fourth generation iPod actually has a built in FM Tuner. However, external FM Tuner adapters are quite prevalent.
Edit: Whoops, sorry about that, I did link the wrong item. Chops is correct, that was a transmitter. The link now points to the original item I had intended to link.
