Q: Growl Notifications for a Twitter List? I am currently using Twitter.
I would like to receive growl notifications for a particular twitter list. However it seems like the current preferences allow notification on a all/none basis.
Do we have an alternative app that offers such an option?
Otherwise I will just create another twitter account and use that for growl.

A: Tweetdeck is the app you're looking for! It comes with his own growl-like notifications and I use it over a year now. It's just great!
