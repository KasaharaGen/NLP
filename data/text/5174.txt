Q: Tools for presentations with Xcode Have you got any tools you use for presentations with Xcode? I'm preparing for some live 'showdowns'. Anything is welcome - mouse pointer enhancers, fast typing with snippets, etc.

A: Omnidazzle is nice. I can't really think of anything else... Try using a clipboard saver to paste faster than you could type and still seem professional.
