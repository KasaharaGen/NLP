Q: Share the clipboards automatically when using Apple Screen Sharing? Is it possible to share the clipboard of my local machine and a remote machine automatically when using OS X's built-in Screen Sharing utility? The whole Edit -> Send Clipboard, Edit -> Get Clipboard routine starts to feel a little cumbersome if you're doing any regular copy and paste work between your local desktop and a remote session.

A: Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the clipboard can be shared automatically. However, instead of going Edit->Send Clipboard and Edit->Get Clipboard, you can use the get/send clipboard buttons:

They're usually hidden by default, but you can get them to appear by clicking this button in the upper right hand corner of the window:
 or going View->Show Toolbar

A: This feature seems to now exist in Apple Screen Sharing Version 1.5 (481.1)
Edit > Use Shared Clipboard
Or View > Show Toolbar and then select Use Shared Clipboard


A: Maybe you might want to switch to JollysFastVNC, which supports pasteboard sync out of the box: http://www.jinx.de/JollysFastVNC.html
Note that it is not free of charge.
You can also get it in the Mac App Store, where the home version (up to 7 computers) costs US-$ 9.99.
