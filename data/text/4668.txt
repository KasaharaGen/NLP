Q: It is required to have a mac to build iphone application or we can use VirtualBox to emulate the MAC OS X platform? It is required to have a mac to build iphone application or we can use VirtualBox to emulate the MAC OS X platform and do the same task ? Is there any license restriction ?
Thanks.

A: It is required that you be running OS X and you can't virtualize OS X on non-Apple hardware (by terms in the EULA, not for any technical reasons). Therefore it follows that you need a Mac computer to build iPhone software.
See this question and answer for a discussion on virtualizing OS X: Is there a way to evaluate OS X without purchasing Macintosh hardware?

A: Yes, you would have to use a Mac computer.
Running MacOSX as a virtual machine would be against Apple's licensing terms.

A: If you want to comply with all Apple's license restrictions, then, yes, you need a Mac to build and sign iOS apps using Apple's latest SDK tools.
