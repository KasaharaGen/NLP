Q: Lost search function iPhone after upgrading to 4.3 Does anyone know how or why the search function in my text messaging is no longer working correctly after I upgraded to 4.3 on my 3G iPhone? 
All was fine until I upgraded and now even tho I can see a name in a text for example I search for it and it comes back as "No results".

A: Searching SMS messages was disabled due to battery life and performance concerns for the 3G, you can see this in the iPhone: Which iOS 4 software features does my iPhone support? article on apple.com

iPhone 3G does not support Spotlight search for SMS/MMS messages.
