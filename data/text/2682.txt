Q: How can one copy photos off an iPad onto a Windows computer (prior to syncing)? My father wants to sync a bunch of photos from his Windows PC to his iPad for a presentation.  But he's never synced photos before.  And he's downloaded a number of photos from his camera directly to his iPad.  I fear his iPad contains the only copy of some of his photos, and he doesn't want to loose them.  When my father turns on photo syncing in iTunes, he gets a warning that photos on the iPad not previously synced will be lost.
If my father was using a Mac, I would tell him to open iPhoto and download the photos from the iPad before syncing.  How can he do the equivalent with Windows (or perhaps with an app)?

A PC, like a Mac, will see the iPad as a camera. Instead of using an application to load the photos, you can just browse to them in Windows Explorer and copy them to a local folder.
