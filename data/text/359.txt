Q: Using Spotlight to play iTunes songs causes another song to play after resuming from pause Spotlight allows you to play songs from iTunes. Unfortunately, when I pause the song and resume, iTunes goes back to playing what it was playing before I used Spotlight.

*Is there any way to fix this behaviour?

*Are there any alternative methods of playing an iTunes song which I already know the name of?


iTunes Version: 10
OS X Version: Snow Leopard

A: Unfortunately there’s no ‘fix’ for the described behavior that I’m aware of.
However, there are a lot of free/paid utilities that will not only do what you need, but also improve the experience overall. 
I could list you a dozen utilities but instead I will let you do your homework and decide what’s best for you. This list contains an important amount of utilities for iTunes controlling.
I can tell you which ones I use and my experience with them. 
1) Coversutra: It’s a very well designed paid application. You can check their website for a more comprehensive summary (and a trial). The developer (Sophia) reads the suggestions and bug reports. 
Pros: It’s very good for searching, very good. Think of a spotlight music dedicated. You can easily switch between playlists, songs, artists, etc. All from the menubar. (I activate it with shift + cmd + space. It also has a controller where you can define your keys for showing album art, define song rating, next, prev, pause, etc. The typical controller stuff. You will rarely need the keyboard. 
Cons: Although it has been optimized several times and results come extremely fast, scrolling the results is not as fast as one would expect. Sometimes certain actions might need a “click”.
All in all, it’s a product that works fantastically for me.
2) Launchbar: I use Launchbar for everything, and sometimes for music too. Since it has iTunes support, you can easily type the name of a song/artist/list and will happily play it. What it does is create a playlist called Launchbar and whenever you make a selection, it adds the relevant songs to that list, therefore when you pause/play, things work normally. You can also do the same things (pause, play, next) from launchbar. 
Pros: It’s also very fast and it does a lot of things (can’t live without it!)
Cons: Might be overkill for a song launcher/iTunes controller only.

A: The solution is quite simple. Quit iTunes before you start using Spotlight to control it. Then it won't have anything else it was playing before to go back to.

A: Why not just use the search that's built into iTunes to find the song by name? It's much faster than Spotlight, and doesn't have the problem you describe:

If you have your heart set of continuing to use Spotlight, then my best guess is that when you 'pause' the song, you're actually stopping it. Next time you play a song through Spotlight, open up the iTunes window and see if the button is to pause the playing media, or to stop it.
