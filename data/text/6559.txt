Is there a way to password protect individual apps? 

I want to know if I can make Mail require a password to actually do anything, see messages, etc. so no one can just go into my Mail and send messages or see my received messages. 

A: To keep email secure in an unsecured account, webmail may be a good option to use instead of Mail.app, which isn't designed to be secured separately from the account it's being used in.

A: I didn't try it myself, but you could set "Keep copies of messages for offline viewing" to "Don't keep copies of any messages" (see screenshot) so you don't have copies of your messages sticking around. Also, you should remove your account password from your keychain, so Mail.app asks for it each time you open it.
If you are going to try this, let us know whether it works as desired :)


A: I know it's not exactly what your looking for, but you can 'disguise' mail by changing it's name and icon to that of another application.
For example pick a random application abc.app that generally would stimulate ones suspicion, and copy it's icon and name to mail.
