Q: 3 Terabyte hard drives in Mac Pro Mid 2010? I got the Mid 2010 Single CPU Mac Pro and want to add a 3 TB hard drive, specifically the Western Digital Caviar Green WD30EZRX.
Does anyone know if that drive will work? Not looking to boot from it, just need a large data drive and got all 4 bays in use already.
Mac is running OS X Lion and windows 7 64-Bit, so GPT partition scheme is no problem.

A: If it fits the in Sata slot, it works.

A: No issue with 3GB, at 6GB you need a different bracket. The drives are the same size but mounting holes are different.
