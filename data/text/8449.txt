Q: Cannot install 64-bit iTunes (v10.5) on Vista I've tried upgrading iTunes, un-installing and reinstalling. Removing all Apple software from my machine. Running the installer with administrative rights. Installing Quicktime independently of iTunes. I've searched everywhere I can about this error I'm experiencing and I still haven't resolved the issue. I've even been through Apple's support article.
Acording to the statistics found under my System in the Control Panel, I am in fact running on a 64-bit OS. Below is the error I'm faced with during installation. Clicking OK cancels the installation wizard.


A: Did some digging because I knew I have seen this error before. It looks like it is not a direct issue with iTunes but with your Microsoft Virtual C++ redistributable. I resolved it by following the steps in http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/microsoftvc80crtversion80507274053typewin32publick/c1359ee5-e18d-4512-8bff-890936db2810 
You are clearly not the only one having this issue, and the steps can be generalized to:


*

*Run windows update

*Download and update your Microsoft C++ redistributable http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=766a6af7-ec73-40ff-b072-9112bab119c2&displaylang=en#filelist
That has worked for me for a couple of different people's problems, and I hope it fixes yours. 
There are additional steps in the thread such as some registry fixes for the windows installer service, however I would give these steps a try first, especially since they cant really cause any harm.

A: You should reinstall all your Microsoft C++ redistributable packages and install all of them (x86 and x64): for VC 2005, 2008, 2010. and then install iTunes 10.5
