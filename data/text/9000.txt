Q: prevent desktops/fullscreen windows from being re-ordered When an application gains focus, it can change the order of desktops in mission control.  In my mind, this creates some very confusion animations. 
Can we force desktops to stay in their order?
Can we disable the animation entirely? (I saw the thread here, nothing seemed to wrok.)

A: Please, look this and this QAs which have answers for your questions.
