Q: How can I make ctrl+right/left arrow stop changing Desktops in Lion? ⌃ Control+→ and ⌃ Control+← switches desktops. 
I actually had this enabled in Spaces on Snow Leopard, but I'd like to turn this off because I use those key combinations when editing in Eclipse. How do I turn this off?

A: I updated an app called Karabiner and it turned some Mission Control shortcuts off. I like moving desktops. Here's how you turn them back on:


A: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control and change the settings for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" or disable them completely.
