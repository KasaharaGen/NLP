Q: Is there a cheaper alternative to cinema displays? Apple displays are great, except for the price.
I'm looking to replace my LG 19" display with a 24".
I can't find any screen that isn't overly widescreen, it's ridiculous ! Wide is good but too wide isn't useful, Apple 24" displays have the screen estate I'm looking for.
Dell used to do nice 24" (2408WFP) but they don't sell them anymore.
Is there any display out there which shares the ratio of Apple's cinema displays but also cheaper ?

A: How about Dell U2410. I use one at home and it is a great monitor.

A: Samsung P2770HD
27" and a resolution of 1920x1080. However only 16bits per pixel, so color banding is very visible. I recently bought one cheap. Happy about the size. Not too happy about the colors. 
The Cinema displays can go up to 2560x1440 and has 24bits per pixel, so this Samsung display can only compete on size and price.

A: I'm not sure what you mean by "overly widescreen" - are you looking at these screens in person or on the web? How can you tell they're overly wide?
I'd be far more concerned with display quality than display sizing. The Dell screens I've used in the past have always been terrible at getting the color quality that a macbook pro screen has.
I'm currently using a Samsung 2333HD next to my MBP and it's a serious competitor to the apple display quality, in my opinion. To be fair, it's just under your specs at 23" but it's more than enough extra screen real estate for me and you'll surely be impressed if you're upgrading from a 19".
The newest apple display is 19.35"x25.7"x8.15" (and that's for a 27" screen) whereas the 2333HD is 16.5"x21.8"x8.5" (for 23") so very close to the same depth and 3"/4" less height/width for 4" less screen size. It's the same 16:9 aspect ratio, so you probably won't be disappointed by the width and, again, you definitely won't miss out on quality. Seems like it runs around $200 these days, I got mine for $150 on sale so you could probably search around a bit for a better price.

A: DELL U2410 is a good choice and new U2412M which use LED as backlight cost less energy.
