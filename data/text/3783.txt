Q: Opening finder instances extremely slow in browsers and quicksilver since 10.6.7 update Since the update OSX to 10.6.7 opening finder windows (such as when you want to save an image in a browser) takes between 5-10 seconds and then an additional 1-3 seconds to show places in the finder window. 
I have tried installing Onyx and rebuilding the links in LaunchServices, and this solved the problem but after a day or so the problem returned. 
There most be some kind of permanent solution to this so I don't have to format and reinstall. 
Any ideas? 

A: Did you update to 10.6.7 using the Software Update utility? Or did you use the Update Combo?
It's not unheard of for the Software Update utility to muck things up. The advantage of using the Update Combo is that it rewrites everything, as opposed to doing a 'delta' upgrade.
It should be noted that the Update Combo package is now weighing in at over 1 GB.
You won't do any harm, and you may fix things, by running the Update Combo linked to above.
