Q: Contacts details not displayed on iPad I'm having a problem with the Contacts app on my iPad. Basically I can't see anymore the contact details. This is what I can see on the right page:

I've rebooted my iPad, closed the app from the multitasking bar, synced etc. but it still doesn't work.
I'm wondering if the only solution is to restore my device (I would like to not have to do it..)

A: I managed to fix the problem by adding a dummy contact - when I saved it, the contact information was visible again. Just deleted the dummy contact afterwards.

A: I have experience with iCloud and my guess is iCloud is causing the problem. If you've checked what's on iCloud (gone to your address book in the cloud) and it's complete, uncheck iCloud's Contacts checkbox on the iPad and when you set it up again, don't merge but replace what's on the iPad with what's on iCloud. I had problems when I started with iCloud and it took a few tries to get things all working together.

A: Simple solution - works for many people (worked for me, after several weeks of frustration!): create a new user - type in a few details, then save. Hey presto, you can see the contact details on the right-hand side again!

A: Unfortunately, I've only been able to solve it by resetting the iPad.
