Q: Time Machine backup is slow. How can I speed it up? My time machine is backup is very slow. Connection is FireWire 800. Transfer is around 5 Mb/s or 0.5 MB/s, which seems slow. I've seen plenty of mention online of very slow Time Machine backups. What are some techniques or suggestions to speed this up?
I have:


*

*Run the Disk Utility Repair tool. Everything is fine.

*Disabled Spotlight on the remote disk


Searching for backupd in system.log gives the following:
13:29:33 Starting standard backup

A: On El Capitan to High Sierra OS - the io is throttled in some cases. You can review these steps in case they apply in your case. Not everyone sees this speed up, but it shouldn’t be hard to test and reverse if it doesn’t help you. Anyone on Mojave and newer should look to other fixes like testing a backup to a blank or erased drive.
Time Machine ridiculously slow after El Capitan upgrade
The throttle should be evident in observing the backupd usage of the filesystem:
sudo fs_usage backupd

Writing a command to /etc/sysctl.conf and then restarting should disable that throttle:
echo 'debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

Or without restarting:
sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0

You'll want to watch for other performance issues (extra CPU usage, other IO slowing, increased energy usage when backing up) after making that low level system tuning adjustment.

A: Unfortunately, the solution in this case was:
Format disk (lose old backups)

Now the disk backs up at full speed.

A: According to this thread:
Delete the "in progress" folder on the TM drive and then things will operate at a normal speed.
Note: That did not fix the problem in my case.

A: You could try renaming the /.Spotlight-V100 folder on the TM volume.  I've never tried this but Spotlight is used to decide which files are new/changed since the last backup.  The only thing that comes to mind in reading your question, is maybe the index is broken and needs to be rebuilt, and TM in the mean time is running that search live, rather than indexed.
Long shot.

A: It could also be related to MRT process. For me, when I removed MRT process, backup speed becomes normal. By the way, MRT is sth called malware remove tool which comes with the security update and it will take lots of CPU to do scanning work. There are some articles on how to remove it.

A: Add the Time Machine disk to the Privacy list of Spotlight (in System Preferences) so that Spotlight does not spend time accessing that drive.

A: Fragmentation
In my experience, it's very common for the catalog B-tree to become very fragmented. On a volume that is both large and full, this type of fragmentation can have a significant effect. 
At any time
Use the demo version of iDefrag to view statistics. 
When the backup volume is as close as possible to full
Consider using the Metadata algorithm of the full version of Defrag, or a comparable utility, to defragment the catalog and other critical files. 
(For a Time Machine backup volume, don't bother with full defragmentation.)
Other utilities
fileXray — this alone can not defragment the relevant files, but for analysis: I know of nothing better than fileXray. 
Cross reference
Do Macs need to be defragmented?
