Q: Office 2008 in native languages I can't find how to buy it, so I assumed that on English is available.
Does anyone know if there are other languages available for this product, or like in Windows version a Profiling Tools that not only change the GUI locale but also adds the dictionaries in that language.
I'm currently searching the Portuguese version for a friend.

A: Office 2008 ships with a Portugese (and a Brazilian alternative) proofing tool as part of the package.

A: Office 2008 for Mac is available in the following languages:


*

*Danish (as part of the Nordic Pack)

*Dutch

*English

*Finnish (as part of the Nordic Pack)

*French

*German

*Italian

*Japanese

*Norwegian (as part of the Nordic Pack)

*Spanish

*Swedish


Office 2011 added Russian and Polish to this list.
I know that for Office 2008, the CD contained only one language, so it's not like other Mac applications that ship with all languages and change based on your system language settings.
