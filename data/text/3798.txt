Q: Simplenote or Evernote or something else? What is the best way to keep my notes stored in the cloud? I want to access them fast and they should be editable on every device I use. (iPhone, iMac, Windows, etc.) What do you personally use? Simplenote or Evernote or is there another contender? 

A: I personally prefer Simplenote because it's simpler, plain text and not that fancy. Well, it's just text snippets and notes for me.
Google gets you loads of comparisons:

EDIT
If you want to look into Simplenote check out Notational Velocity!

A: If you're already a dropbox user and are willing to limit the number of cloud services you use, store your notes in dropbox :
- Plaintext is a stylish text editor for iOS devices with dropbox synchro
- Epistle is the equivalent for Android

A: I was an early adopter of Evernote and it is a great service, but I've been using SimpleNote + Notational Velocity for a while now and I couldn't be happier. I recommend this setup to everyone I know with a Mac + iPhone.
