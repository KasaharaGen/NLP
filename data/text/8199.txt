Q: How to store unused Macbook battery for long period of time? I'm going on a long backpacking trip and going to leave my Macbook at home unused. How should I store its battery to maximize the battery life?

A: Battery technology used by Apple is no different than other laptops. They're all Li-ion cells.
Apparently, the recommended practice for extended storage is to get the battery down to 40% and store it in a cool place, possibly the refrigerator.
