Is there a way to mute sound from one application on macOS ?

Volume Mixer for Mac lives in your menu bar. With simple features like muting apps by double clicking and detaching an app from the master volume by right clicking, Volume Mixer is easy to learn and simple to use.

Sadly not for free but it seems to have been harder work than you think, so support the devs!

A: There's a nice open source app, BackgroundMusic, that provides for per app volume control in OSX10.10+:

A: SoundSource is good paid application ($40) that allows volume controls per application and also allows sound device selection per application.
