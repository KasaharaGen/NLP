Q: How can I use my iPod touch as an external disk? I have a 2nd generation iPod touch (8GB), but I don't know how to make it work as an external disk. I think I saw a checkbox somewhere but I can't find it anymore. 
I've searched the Web, but the way it should work (as a check box on the front page of iTunes when the iPod is connected) doesn't work for me...
Am I missing something or is this not possible anymore? I had an iPod nano that worked in the manner described.
Edit: I would like it to work with a Mac, a PC, the USB port of a DVD player, etc. (as with my good old nano)

A: I don't think it is possible using iTunes.
You can try iPhone Explorer, though (which is free), or Phone Disk

A: You’re correct that other iPods had the ability to “Enable Disk Mode”, however: 

Other iPod’s have Disk Mode where you can use the iPod as a hard drive. However, the iPod Touch doesn’t have this mode. There is currently no way to get it to show up in the Finder on a Mac or on the Windows Desktop. You are only able to use the iPod Touch within the iTunes application. (source)

Not all is lost, as there are some utilities that may do it.
