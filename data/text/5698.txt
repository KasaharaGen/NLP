Q: How do I move application data from one Mac account to another? I'd like to move my kids applications to a separate account but am trying to figure out the best way to move the application data.  For example, are documents and settings stored somewhere consistently on a Mac or do I need to use some sort of migration assistant?

A: The migration assistant makes it very easy to move a whole account. You could then make an applications folder in their account (before or after the migration) to contain the apps you only want to be seen by them.
