Q: Is there a way to show the speed of copying files on a Mac? Is there a way to show the speed of copying files on a Mac?  For example, when copying a file from the hard drive to SDHC card and vice versa.  
The reason is that I can check out the max speed of an SDHC card on my Dell PC, but it seems that on there, the card interface is limited to 20MB/s read or write.  So I want to check how it is on the iMac 27 inch.  Maybe some test program can be used, but I still like to find out any simple way to tell the speed of copying files on the Mac.

A: If you're comfortable in the Terminal, you can use rsync to copy some files from one place to another and it'll give you summary stats on the speed:
rsync -a --progress --stats --human-readable path_to_source path_to_dest

E.g. rsync --stats --human-readable ~/Desktop/Large-File /Volumes/OtherDisk/Dir
You can also type into the terminal just the command:
rsync -a --progress --stats --human-readable 

(note there needs to be one or more spaces after --human-readable to end that command and break before the source and destination file names are provided) 
Then drag the file / folder you wish to copy and drop it onto the terminal window, followed by dragging and dropping the destination directory. Dragging and dropping a file / folder onto a terminal window will place that file/folder's path into the terminal window. Dragging a file is preferred in most cases since it will handle a space in any folder or file name. In this case the space needs an \ to indicate not to end the file name exactly opposite of needing the space earlier.
The output of the above command will be similar to:
[jnet@Kyle ~]$ rsync -a --progress --stats --human-readable /Users/jnet/Pictures/Screen\ Caps /Volumes/Scratch

A: The simplest method is to just tap into the overall IO speed measurements that the system maintains.
If you like the command line, diskutil list shows you what drives map to which disk0, disk1, etc... and iostat 1 will dump the transfer speeds each second. You will need to press Control-C to quit this program when done. Also, if you want a longer measurement just change the 1 to however many seconds you want to average the IO speeds.
If you like graphs, the "Activity Monitor" will aggregate the IO from all disks.  Select the tab "Disk Activity", there a live graph of either the IO per second or Throughput (Data) per second over time for all drives combined.
