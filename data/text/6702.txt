Q: How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book on Snow Leopard? How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book in the hard drive on Snow Leopard?

A: The data is stored in several places. It's best to just export the data to the desktop if you want it in one file. 
The complicated answer is in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook as well as in various cache files if you have enabled LDAP/open directory integration or other sync options to get contacts into and out of your address book. 

A: Should be ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/
If you hit File -> Export... -> Address Book Archive you can create a backup. The resulting Addressbook - <date>.abbu file (which is actually a folder) actually just contains the contents of the abovementioned location.
