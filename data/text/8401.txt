Q: Podcast cover art missing since upgrading to iOS 5 Since upgrading my iPhone 3GS to iOS 5 some of my podcasts no longer display their custom cover art. They sync OK but use the default image. I'm still syncing over USB, no iCloud or Wi-Fi sync at the moment. The cover art displays correctly in iTunes itself.

*How can I get the missing cover art back on my iPhone?


A: I was able to fix this myself in the end by deleting the podcasts on the iPhone itself and then re-syncing. Sometimes it took several attempts before the cover art came back.
