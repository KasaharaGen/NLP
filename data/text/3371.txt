Remove mono bluetooth profile or set stereo as default. 

Whenever I turn on my Nokia bluetooth headphones they automatically connect to my Macbook. The problem is they always connect to the Mono (and not the Stereo) profile.  So I have to disconnect and reconnect with the stereo profile.  Is there anyway to either delete the mono profile or set the stereo profile as the default?
