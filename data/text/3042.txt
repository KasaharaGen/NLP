Q: How iPad screen gameplay is captured? In some video such as

I see that it looks like the iPad video is captured... but it is also said that the Component cable for iPad only works for movies and photos, but not for apps...  so how can it be done?

A: It's likely the video was captured using the iOS development emulator rather than the actual iPad itself.

A: As in my comment, the Simulator probably is not it...  I have heard using the VGA adaptor and using a VGA to computer file recorder box that can hook up VGA output to a computer's USB port and record the VGA signal... maybe that's it...  I wonder if this is how the "white dot" is recorded.
