Q: How to remove a folder link from side bar in OS X Lion I've updated my OS to Lion today. But now, I can't remove the folder "maven-2.2.0" from Finder Sidebar. This folder was deleted from my computer, and I can't right click on it.
How to do it?


A: Hold down ⌘ Command while dragging the item out.
I found this Lion change interesting; I don't necessarily like it, but I think it mirrors the way that you have to hold down ⌘ when rearranging toolbar items.
