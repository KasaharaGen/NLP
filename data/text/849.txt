Q: iPhone App Update from a Development Point of View I am doing iPhone development and my first app is in the market. First week was pretty good but now it is loosing momentum. If I provide an update to the app will it improve the app exposure in the iPhone app store.

A: All an update will do is reset the star rating for the application if it an .x release (for example, 1.0 to 1.1). 
But to take the question and answer a big step further (one that falls well outside the scope of this forum), you cannot rely solely on the App Store to market your app. All of the rules for online marketing still apply.

A: I'd recomend that you read a book that I'm reading these days, Tapworthy. It has a lot of advice on what to add to your apps, what to do to keep them interesting, and so on.
Anyway, you should market the app as if it were you who were selling it. Create a dedicated website, with a big iPhone picture and screenshots or videos inside it. Create a dedicated twitter account, and give out promo codes to influential bloggers and app reviews sites...
