Q: Activation fails on iPad running iOS Beta 7 This morning my iPad wanted to activate itself once more and at some point I receive the following message:

We're unable to complete your activation on my iPad
This device is not registered as part of the iPhone Developer Program. If you are a member of the Program, please register your device in the http://developer.apple.com/iphone/.

I am member of the developer and I have registered this device. What should I do?

A: Try updating to the GM. It's the last usable version for the dev's. 

A: You need to update to the GM  Betas are just that, betas, and Apple has them expire over time to prevent their longterm use. 
To update from the Beta 7 to the GM, either:
1) Restore your device via iTunes. iTunes will automatically download the proper build and install it. 
2) Download the proper GM release from developer.apple.com.
It is not possible to upgrade from the betas to the GM. Make sure your phone is backed up beforehand, either via iTunes or iCloud. Once you complete the restore, you can restore from the backup to get your data and apps back.
