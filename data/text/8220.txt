Q: Carbon Copy Cloner and FileVault Volumes I am about to get my SSD back from an RMA process.
I currently have my backup HDD and I'm considering utilizing FileVault's full disk encryption. I'd like to minimize the number of writes before I get the SSD back in my machine.
Can I enable FileVault on both drives, then Carbon Copy Clone the HDD -> SSD?

A: I replied earlier with an answer without noticing you had tagged it as Lion related; take a look at this document, it should answer most of your questions.
From the Developer of CCC:

Is there any possibility to have the backup on my other second drive be encrypted?
Yes, you can enable encryption on your backup volume, or reformat it
  as encrypted using Disk Utility:
Full Disk Encryption (Lion only)
CCC fully supports Lion's Full Disk Encryption.
