Q: How to format the OS X installer USB stick that comes with MacBook Air? When you purchase a new MacBook Air they give you a mini-USB drive that is used to reinstall OS X and iLife '11.
How can I format this USB stick and put whatever I want on it?
The option to format is not available in Disc Utility and the USB stick mounts as a CD.
Note: I realize what the disk is used for and what Apple says on their FAQ. My question isn't "What do you think about formatting the USB?" it is "How can I format the USB?" The answer may be that it is impossible.

A: From Apple's MacBook Air: Frequently Asked Questions about Software Reinstall Drive:

Note: The MacBook Air Software Reinstall Drive is read only.  You cannot erase it, reformat it, or reuse it as a general purpose USB storage device.

Honestly, thumb drives are dirt cheap these daysâ€”why would you want to lose your only way to reinstall your OS?

A: It most definitely is possible to reformat these drives and they are awesome 8GB USB ThumbDrives, once you do. However, I did it by accident, playing with the partition tables in Mac OS X Terminal (Command Line) and haven't replicated the process yet.
