Q: Volume too low using hdmi from mac air I tried connecting my Mac-Air to my TV using the HDMI adapter. The volume is very low. Even cranked all the way up, it is still not loud enough watching hulu, netflix etc.
Any suggestions?

A: Make sure you select the correct HDMI Output in System Preferences | Sound. You are probably still listening to the sound through the mac speakers.
