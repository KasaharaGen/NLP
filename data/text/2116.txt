Q: How can I change the Guest account's background image? When I login as guest, then change the background, logout, and log back in, the background is not saved. How can I choose which background the guest account will have?

A: This article explains it very nice. Basically you are modifying a "User Template" file, which is used to create a fresh new user every time you log in as a Guest. If you're not quite sure on how to do it just ask for help. :)
