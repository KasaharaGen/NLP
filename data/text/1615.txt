Q: Is there way to save google maps for offline iphone without jailbreak I've iPhone 3Gs and want to download Google maps to use them offline with GPS.
So is there a good app do that for me ?
Note: i don't want to jailbreak my iPhone.

A: No, nor will you find one (in the official App Store). Storing the image tiles breaches Google's data licence. There are a bunch of apps that use OpenStreetMap, which has a more liberal licence.

A: NO.
You can't download stuff like that for offline without a jailbreak.

A: I know it's not very helpful but some Android phones do have this capability.

A: I would recommend
Offline+Maps

or
City maps 2 Go
