Q: How do i stop Quicktime from opening previous videos? I'm on OSX Lion and this is driving me crazy. Whenever i watch a video in quicktime and close it, then open another video, the previous video that i played also comes up.
Is there a way to not have the previous video(s) come up when opening quicktime besides closing out the windows, then quitting, everytime?

A: That feature is part of Lion and QuickTimeX, but you can disable it.
Open your terminal (/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app) or use Spotlight to find the Terminal and type:
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false

That should stop QuickTime from saving the opened windows when you quit it.
If you want to revert the behavior, change the "false" to "true".

A: The above answer did not work for me. But the commands below worked:
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.LSSharedFileList RecentDocuments -dict-add MaxAmount 0

You can run these commands in the Terminal(/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app or using the Spotlight).
