Q: Changing your path variable 
Possible Duplicate:
Adding gedit to my PATH 

I'm very new to OSX.
I installed Ruby with HomeBrew, and the rubygems installer said that I should add a certain path (/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.2-p180/bin) to my PATH variable.
Great, I obviously don't know how to do that, so I used the advice on this site.  However, I assume I messed it up completely, because I think that is the only thing contained in my PATH variable.  For example, ls doesn't work in terminal anymore - I'm guessing that's because it's contained in a folder that used to be included in PATH and now is not.
If I type echo $PATH I only get the one directory back (/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.2-p180/bin).  
Have I completely stuffed it now?  Can I get it back?  And how the hell do you edit your path variable?
