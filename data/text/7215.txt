Q: How to resolve network issue or DNS to access web page on Snow Leopard Server? I have my network setup like as follows:
internet > router 1 > ethernet ports > switch > router 2
I have a Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server connected to "router 1", but it is so slow when accessing a web page hosted on the server from a browser on a workstation connected to either router 1 or router 2?
Is there a problem with my network setup or maybe because I changed the name to newservername.local?

A: This would most commonly be a problem with MTU sizes. Try setting yours to something a bit smaller (1450 or so), you can do this under the Hardware tab in Network preferences.
