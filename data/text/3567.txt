Q: How can I use the dvdbackup tool in Mac OS X? I want to use 'dvdbackup' tool in my Mac OS X, however its specification is too simple. I would like to know how to back up my whole DVD, can anyone give my some example or advice step by step?

A: From the man page:
dvdbackup -M -i/dev/dvd -o/my/dvd/backup/dir/ This action creates a valid DVD-Video structure that can be burned to a DVD-/+R(W) with help of mkisofs version 1.11a27 or later  http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/dvdbackup
Honestly I have never used this tool on Mac OS X, if you want to do some dvd ripping and this keeps frustrating you, Handbrake is pretty good, or you can even use the built in Disk Utility to do a image backup of said DVD.
