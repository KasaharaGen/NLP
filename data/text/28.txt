Q: How can I get DoubleTwist to differentiate between music and podcasts? Since iTunes has no way to sync with my Motorola Droid, and all of my music is on my Macbook Pro, I recently tried out DoubleTwist.  It detected my Droid right away.
The problem is that when I chose to sync all of my music, DoubleTwist also synced all of my podcasts, which quickly filled up my sd card with stuff I don't want on there.  Is there a way to have it only sync my iTunes music library and ignore podcasts?

A: Judging by the screenshots, doubleTwist allows syncing specific playlists and has smart playlists.
Create a smart playlist that would contain all your library but not podcasts (excluding genre Podcast), and sync it.
