Q: Why am I receiving this error code, when trying to rename a flash drive? Broken image removed

I receive this error upon attempting to rename a flash drive. The renaming process works, but I would like to know what this error is, and why it's appearing.

A: Have you tried reformatting the unit to FAT using disk utility and then trying to rename? FAT is the default filesystem for most USB sticks. I had this problem, reformatted it with disk util and it started working.
