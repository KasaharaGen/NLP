Q: How can I change the colors of calendars on iOS5 Supposedly, you can change the colors of calendars from the iPhone now. How!? (In particular, I'm trying to do it for google calendars synced via exchange, but I can't see how to do it with iCloud ones, either.)

A: You can do this in the Calendar app.
1) Tap Calendars in the upper left corner:

2) Then tap Edit:

3) Select the calendar you want to change the colour of:

4) Pick the colour you want. If you want a more extensive selection than what's in the list, you need to do it from iCal on your Mac.
