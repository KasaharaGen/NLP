Q: How do I stop Yahoo Sync? Since upgrading to Max OS X 10.7.2 and converting my MobileMe Account to iCloud I am receiving endless dialog boxes asking about syncing Yahoo Contacts.
I cannot find settings anywhere to turn this off. I have to manually dismiss these frakking dialogues, which come up at the rate of about one an hour.

A: I was curious about this myself and started by looking in Activity Monitor, found that "launchd" was the service that kicked off the Yahoo Contacts Sync.  After some googl'ing I found out that custom scripts for launchd get executed from the ~(user)/Library/LaunchAgents folder.  In there, you'll find the culprit -- at least, I did.  Now I dunno if I should simply delete them (since I don't care about syncing contacts, I don't use the Mail.app) or if I can just disable it by tweaking the plist file.  Hope that helps!
EDIT: I discovered that going into the AddressBook.app preferences and unchecking the accounts listed caused the plist files to be removed.  If you check them again, they reappear.  Works for me!  :)

A: Here is how I solved this:


*

*launch Address Book

*go to Preferences -> Accounts tab -> On My Mac item

*check Synchronize with Yahoo! box (which was unchecked for me)

*choose cancel in the resulting dialogue box


I can only guess that checking Synchronize with Yahoo! and canceling the resulting dialogue shook some sense into some forgotten settings.

A: Both Address Book and iTunes have (or had) UI for authenticating with Yahoo and enabling contact sync. When you migrated to iCloud, the UI probably went away.
One heavy-handed technique to solve this would be to remove /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/YahooSync.framework from your system.
