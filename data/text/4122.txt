Q: Bluetooth mouse that doesn't require a USB dongle Since my Macbook only has two USB ports, I'd like to get myself a mouse that can pair with the Mac's built-in bluetooth. The obvious choice is the Apple Magic Mouse, but at $70 it's pretty much overkill. I don't need the touch functionality, since the Mac's trackpad already does a great job with that. 
I'm mostly looking for something that allows me accurate control, isn't too large (so I can toss it in my backpack), and isn't too expensive. And looks nice next to the Aluminum Macbook, or course. :)

A: The Logitech V470 Cordless Laser Mouse for BluetoothÂ® may suit your needs.
BTW: I've used Logitech mice for a long time now and can say that they're built very well. They're a pleasure to use. The MX1000 is the greatest mouse ever built in my opinion. I've yet to use a Bluetooth mouse though.

A: I've used the RadTech BT500 for some time and love it.  It's small, rechargeable, works well, and silver in color, to look good next to aluminum Macs.

A: Read about the Mad Catz R.A.T M. It is a mobile Gaming Mouse which doesen't require a dongle.
