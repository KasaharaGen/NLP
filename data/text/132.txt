Q: Is there a usable iOS4 Terminal App? Mobile Terminal 426 appears to be the only non-crashing iOS4 Terminal App. Unfortunately it's missing all of its convenience features, like gestures. Are there alternatives?

A: I use iSSH: http://www.zinger-soft.com/iSSH_features.html
It's available on the app store, but if you're jailbroken you can ssh to 127.0.0.1 and it works just fine.  Costs $10 though.

A: If by terminal you mean SSH (or telnet): I have used TouchTerm (from way back when it was for free, now its 4$) and iSSH. 
I like TouchTerm better on the iPhone as I find the semi-transparent keyboard better.
I prefer iSSH on the iPad because it has a real iPad version.
Also iSSH has a VNC client and an X server that can be tunneled over SSH. But its 10$.
