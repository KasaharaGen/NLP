Q: How do I maximize window after I've minimize them? I'm a new Mac user and I regularly minimize windows using the Command + M shortcut. Is there a keyboard shortcut to restore these windows?

A: beside Asmus Solution you can use cmd+tab to find your minimize software's windows after you go on select windows hold option and release all the key.

A: The only way I know of is to get into Expos√© mode (e.g. press (fn +) F3 on newer keyboards) and then pressing the down arrow key. You will see the currently selected minimised window (in the lower third of the screen) surrounded by a blue shadow and you can select other windows by moving around with the arrow keys. You can then bring any window to the foreground by hitting return.
