Q: iOS iTunes latest podcasts not showing up On my iPod touch running iOS 4.1, the iTunes store app (purple note icon) lets me search for podcasts and download episodes. In my RSS feeds I often see a new podcast episode announced, so I load up the podcast in iTunes and inevitably the most recent episode is absent. Has anyone else experienced this problem, and are there any solutions to this? besides:


*

*use Instacast

*sync to PC/Mac iTunes

*wait a few days for it to show up


A: I hear this more and more. iTunes on the PC directly uses the RSS feed and can be downloaded immediately. The podcasts in the iTunes store are cached, meaning that a process has to go out and update it. You have no control over this. If you don't want to continuously sync with iTunes, get a podcast app for the iPod Touch. I like Podcaster though there are many others. This app like all of the others uses the direct RSS feed and can pull down the show immediately.
