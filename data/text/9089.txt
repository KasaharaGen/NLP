Q: Is there a way to prevent downloads of purchased items to iTunes? Is there a way to indicate that I do not want a given item to ever be downloaded to iTunes, but prefer to have it remain in the cloud?
For example, if I purchase a TV show or movie, iTunes assumes I want it downloaded to my machine, and will attempt to do so several times, even when I cancel the download and delete it from the downloads list. In general, after several tries, iTunes seems to finally give up, but it's hardly a convenient process convincing it to do so. This the issue repeats (automatically) with purchased TV series.

A: *

*Open iTunes

*Click iTunes Store

*Go to the iTunes Store Home

*On the right column is the text "Purchased" with a little bubble that says (new). Click "Purchased"

*Find the show that you don't want.

*Click it and then a window should pop up containing the show

*There should be an (X) next to the show. Click That

*iTunes will ask you whether you want to make the show hidden. You do.

*Repeat for all other shows.


A: There is no way to designate one specific purchased item to not auto-download and remain in the cloud, but you can specify certain kinds of purchased items like videos, music, books, etc. 
In iTunes > Preferences > Store Preferences on your computer, make sure to uncheck "Always check for available downloads" and "Automatically download pre-orders". 
Initiate the purchase on a device other your computer. The simplest way would be to initiate the purchase on a Apple TV, as those purchases will now remain in the cloud and not auto-download to iTunes on your computer. 


A: Same here,
purchased on ATV3 and not showing up in my itunes as a purchase - but constantly starting the download after a login on itunes. 
I switched all auto downloads off and even shut off TV Series and Movies on my itunes to show up - still did not help...
