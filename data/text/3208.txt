Q: How can I check my line-in does work (MBP late 2010)? How can I check my line-in does work? 
I'm interesting what software should I use and how.
It is MBP, late 2010. I do have an external working mic.

A: *

*Launch System Preferencesâ€¦ from the Apple menu.

*Click on Speech.

*The left tab is marked Speech Recognition.

*Set the Microphone from the default "Internal microphone" to "Line In".

*Click on the Calibrate button. Then speak the phrases on the left e.g. "What Time Is It?"


If your Mac detects your line-in, you'll see the blue-green-red indicator respond to the volume of your voice from the line-in.
Have fun, and don't forget to mark the question as answered when you're done. Cheers.

A: You could try using LineIn.app from rogueamoeba. It allows to pass-through audio from line-in to speakers (normally disabled in Mac OS X). I did use this app quite a few times to play music from external source. Should do the trick for you.
