Q: iPad books do not show all images I have an iPad2 (brand new) onto which I have loaded books from the app store. Most of these books are showing a blue question make where the images should be. This includes the 'iPad User Guide" from Apple itself.
In the "iPad User Guide," it also shows the following error message:
This page contains the following errors:
error on Line 1 at column 1: Document is empty error on Line 1 at column 1: Encoding error
On some books, double tapping the icon will display the picture but on others it wont. If I attempt to adjust the font size, the app just crashes.
Has anyone come across this? Is there some magic setting I'm missing?
BTW: PDF books work fine.

A: I just installed the latest update for iBooks and the problem is fixed.
