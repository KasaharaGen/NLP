Q: Display pressed shortcuts as an overlay on the screen On this great Ruby on Rails screencast, every time a shortcut combination is pressed it shows up on top of the screen, and it shows up so often that I find it hard to believe it was placed by hand when editing the movie.
Is there any application that does this?

A: Not sure which specific screencast you're speaking of, but they may be using Keycastr.

A: For the sake of completeness: Boinx Software's Mousepos√© does this (and a lot more) as well ($17).
