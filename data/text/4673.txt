Q: Can you help me cure font outlines (as opposed to the font itself) showing up in webpages? I am having some issues with fonts rendering improperly across browsers. Essentially i am just getting outlines, an example can be viewed her. 

For example on this page. http://book.cakephp.org/view/1442/link all of the navigation links in the teal bar appear as outlines.. as do the main nav items on the left side of the  screen. this is how my browser is showing this page 

My first attempt at fixing this involved removing all duplicate fonts on my system ( there were a couple ) but that did not seem to fix it. A friend of said it was might be a conflict between Helvetica and Helvetica Neue installed but i need both of those fonts.. any suggestions? 

A: You need to empty your font cache and restart--and there are a variety of utilities, some free, that will do this for you.
