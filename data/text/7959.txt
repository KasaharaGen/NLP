Q: ffmpeg giving error on launch in Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 I installed ffmpeg 0.8.5 in my Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1 with Homebrew
brew install --use-gcc ffmpeg

It installed without any error. But, now when I run, it gives the following -
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/0.8.5/lib/libavdevice.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
  Reason: Incompatible library version: ffmpeg requires version 53.0.0 or later, but libavdevice.dylib provides version 52.0.0
Trace/BPT trap: 5


A: Try using:
$ brew update && brew install `brew outdated` && brew cleanup

This script will also help you track down changes on libraries that are needed.
If you those don't work try:
$ brew doctor (check your setup for common problems)
$ brew missing (to check installed packages for missing deps)

brew doctor checks your setup for common problems, brew missing checks installed packages for missing deps.
You can always start fresh (which should take care of all the problems):
$ brew uninstall --force `brew deps ffmpeg`
$ brew install ffmpeg

then
$ brew update


A: I ran: 
brew install libav
then after it complained about symlinking:
brew link --overwrite avconv
Works now.
