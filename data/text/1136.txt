Q: What type of connection does a Macbook Pro DVD Drive use? My DVD drive isn't working at the moment. I attempted to put another drive in instead, but that didn't work either. My friend suggested that there might be a problem with the connection. What type of connection do I have to obtain?

A: There's one here for a hefty $28.95, though you might find a cheaper one by shopping around.
