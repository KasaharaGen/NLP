Q: Can we modify UDID added in iOS developer portal? I have an ios developer account. I by mistake added a wrong device Id in my devices. Can I modify the device id? I am able to modify my device name but not device id. 
What can be done?
Please help and suggest.
Thanks.

A: No, it can't be done. You can only remove devices when you renew your subscription.
