Q: iChat: Very slow transfer speeds/Port Restricted I have a 12mbps connection, so I know that my ichat transfers should be super fast.  When I receive files from some people, my transfer rate is about 1k/sec, which is horrible.  Why would this be happening?  Do I need to do something with my router?
In the Connection Doctor it says Router Type: Port Restricted.

A: You'll want to use these two documents to forward the appropriate ports on your router:


*

*Using iChat with a firewall or NAT router (apple.com)

*ZyXEL Q1000Z: How to create a custom Application Rule (qwest.com)


If you have specific questions about port forwarding on your router, you could try asking over at Super User.
