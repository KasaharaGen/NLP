Q: Is there a plugin to block ads in Mobile Safari? Is there any plugin to block ads in iPhone, iPad's Safari like Ad Block Plus is available for Firefox (Desktop)?
Without jailbreaking.

A: Currently there is no way to block ads in mobile safari without a jailbreak or the use of an alternative browser from the app store.

A: There is actually a free service called speedmeup (http://www.speedmeup.net/) which does not require to install an app. It works with wifi connections and will block ads inside apps, videos or music stream. 
For your information, I am affiliated with the product but I think it works great.
