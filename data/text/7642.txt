Q: Keyboard shortcut to unhide or unminimize a window in OS X I am asking this question because I feel it belongs on apple, not superuser. Also the perfect answer is not checked off there.
You hide a window using ⌘ + M. However even ⌘ + ⇥ to that window does not help as the window is minimized. How do you unminimize?

A: A very quick keyboard method to un-minimize a specific window or un-minimize all of an app's minimized windows is this:
Command ⌘+Tab ⇥ to the app with minimized windows, but don't release the Command ⌘ key.
While still holding Command ⌘ down, tap Down ↓ or 1 (easy 1-handed access) to enter App Exposé. Once in App Exposé, all keys can be released.
To un-minimize all windows, select any window with arrow keys, then press Option ⌥+Return ↩.
To un-minimize a specific window, navigate to the window you want with the arrow keys, then press Return ↩.

A: When you ⌘ + ⇥ to that application, hold the ⌥ key before releasing ⌘. This will reopen the application, typically bringing up a minimized window if there are no other windows up.
An alternative is to minimize using ⌘ + H which hides the window, but does not actually minimize it, therefore you can still ⌘ + ⇥ to it without any special action.
