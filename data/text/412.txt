Q: Can I get HDR on the 4th gen iPod Touch by upgrading to iOS 4.1? I got to see the whole keynote at September 1st and assumed that iOS 4.1 would bring HDR to iPod Touch (4th gen) and the iPhone (3Gs and 4).
Today I got my iPod Touch and I don't get it, where's the HDR button? I get that there is no flash (was announced), but HDR Button should be there, right?
Did I wrongly assume that iPod Touch would have HDR?

A: HDR photo is only available on iPhone 4 with iOS 4.1. Also, the rear camera is less then 1MP where iPhone 3 is 5MP.
iPod Touch's Software Update page does not list HDR photo.

A: Do yourself a favor and buy Pro HDR. This works just great on my iPhone 3GS, even though it is slower than the Apple HDR feature.
