Q: How much faster is the flash storage on the MacBook Air than SSD? I heard that the flash storage in the MacBook Air is faster than SSD since it doesn't need to go through a SATA interface. How much faster is the MacBook Air's hard-drive compared to a traditional SSD?

A: It's still a SATA interface, just miniaturized, hence it's name mSATA.
There is a great picture at the following link that shows just how tiny an mSATA drive is compared to a regular 2.5" laptop hard drive.

A: From everything I've heard, it's smaller, but not faster.
Article. Article. Article.
Take a look at the benchmarks, especially in the second article. The second and third say that it still uses SATA, just mini/micro or something like that.

A: Directly comparing the new MacBook Air against the older model on SSD performance alone, the new MacBook Air is much faster. This is from personal experience and from benchmarks found on various sites posted below:

Can't comment on SSD comparisons with regards SSD drives found in other MacBook models.
