Q: Is it possible to create a Wi-Fi hotspot from iPhone that's not ad-hoc? First off, I am well aware of how to—in general—create a wireless hotspot using an ad-hoc network directly from my iPhone.
I have previously used the latest version of MyWi (version 4.12.6 at time of writing) but it creates ad-hoc networks and this doesn't work for me.
I do not want to and cannot create an ad-hoc network from my iPhone to allow another device to share its connection (must be wireless, as bridged connections don't help either).
Does anybody know if this is possible?

A: In iOS 4.3 there will be Personal Hotspot integrated in firmware. Just wait
