Q: Why doesn't the Mac App Store Twitter app (v. 2.0.2) work well with Spaces? It's something that drives me crazy. The current version (2.0.2) of the official Twitter app for Mac OS X doesn't behave well with Spaces. It moves from space to space when I select another application (switching with cmd TAB.)
Is there a way to fix this or do I have to wait for a new release?

A: If you want Twitter to stay in one Space, you can assign it to that Space in the Spaces PrefPane. The downside to this is that you have to remove and re-add that assignment every time you launch Twitter. Can't wait for this bug to be fixed.

A: Having looked at the reviews of the app it seems to be a bug so you will have to wait.
You could try its predecessor Tweetie which I think is much better.

A: You should also pay attention to the excellent Kiwi app. I wrote a review of this app a few months ago, which has more customization options than the Twitter and Tweetie
Kiwi is gorgeous and so easy to use!

A: Twitterific is what I use for OS X. As a spaces user, I can assure you it plays nicely. It costs $10 which is a little steep but there is an advertisement version so you can try before you buy. Or you could just use it until Twitter for Mac is fixed. ;) Very nice user experience in my opinion.
