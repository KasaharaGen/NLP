Q: Can you set custom ringtones for contact groups? In iPhone, you can easily change the default ringtone (Settings → Sounds → Ringtone) and set a custom ringtone for individual people (Contacts → [some person] → Edit → Ringtone). 
But can you set a custom tone for a group of contacts? (E.g. "family" or "workmates".)
I think that would be handy—and quite basic functionality, so to speak—but I couldn't find a way to do this through the iPhone UI. Is it possible at all (without jailbreaking)?

A: It is unfortunately not (yet or ever?) officially supported as a feature of iOS.

A: yes, you can assign ringtones to contact groups on iPhone using Grouptones tweak ($2.99 in Cydia, requires jailbreak). 
See http://grouptonesapp.com for details!

A: It had this feature on my 3Gs. I know because I just upgraded to the 4s and it's not there. They changed it. 

A: Just use this app: GRingtones, it is a group managing app.
The most important feature is that GRingtones could set a ringtone for each group!
