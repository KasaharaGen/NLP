Q: How can I upgrade my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone 3GS to 4.2? I have an iPhone 3GS running on 4.0.1 and I want to upgrade it to 4.2 with my Mac. How can I go about doing this?

A: There is nothing special to upgrading when jailbroken or not. You must use the official upgrade path which means losing unlock and jailbreak, and then re-jailbreak and re-unlock if you want and if it is possible with the new firmware. So...
