Q: Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to [delete] loosing the [command]? Is it possible to redefine the keyboard shortcut for deleting files to delete loosing the command ?
How?

A: Normally it is possible to customize your own keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard pref pane, but you cannot re-map the Delete key.
So in short, no, it is not possible to re-map Cmd ⌘+Delete to simply the Delete key.
EDIT:
This would be a "hack", but it just occurred to me that if you have a programmable mouse with an extra button, you may be able to assign the Cmd ⌘+Delete key combo to that button.  It won't work using the built-in Mouse pref pane, but there may be a third-party app that can do it -- e.g. USB Overdrive or Logitech Control Center (for Logitech mice, obviously).
