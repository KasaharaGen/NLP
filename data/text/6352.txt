Q: Mouse stops working in Bootcamp (XP) I've been using Bootcamp (XP) with no problem for quite a while now. Today, when I tried booting to XP, my mouse will work for about a second and then stop working. If i unplug/replug it, it will sometimes work for another second and then stop. The keyboard works fine. I've tried several different mice, all corded.
Does anyone have any idea what's going on or how I can fix it?

A: Have you tried using other mice, either the same make and model or another brand altogether, and do they exhibit the same problem? If not, then you probably have a hardware failure with your mouse.
Beyond that, what have you changed or upgraded or installed on the Mac side just before this problem appeared? What have you changed or upgraded or installed on the Windows XP side just before the problem appeared? There must be something. This is the key to troubleshooting.
Reset the PRAM.
If that does not help, report back.
