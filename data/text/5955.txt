Q: How can I get Safari 5.1 to show the download window? I know that I can simply click the downloads icon next to the search bar, however I'm visually impaired and have trouble using the mouse (I can't find it, miss click), therefore I'm much faster with the keyboard.
I'm wondering how I can show and focus the downloads manager in Safari 5.1 just like in prior versions.

A: Or you could follow the advice of Red Sweater^1 and use AppleScript + FastScript/Sparkle. If you follow the link everything is explained in details.

A: The same keyboard shortcut for opening Downloads in the Finder works to show and hide the Downloads window within Safari (I'm using 5.1.1).
The shortcut is ⌥⌘L
Note: If you're entering text in a form, open the Downloads window then close it, Safari has trouble returning focus to the form item I was in despite still showing the blue focus ring.

A: If you have Full Keyboard Access Enabled you can press Tab till you arrive on the icon & then press space to view
