Q: Syncing Address book to Google Apps doesn't sync groups When I sync my address book on my mac to Google Apps (gmail) it doesn't sync groups. Is this normal?

A: This isn't a supported feature of the address book/google sync.
This support article from Google (point 4) states that 

"Currently, groups are not synced to
  Gmail. We're hoping to add this
  functionality in the future."
