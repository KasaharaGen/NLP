Q: Does the iPod Touch calendar support every other day scheduling? Does the iPod Touch calendar support every other day scheduling?

A: You can set that up, but not on the device. There's no interface to more complex recursion rules in the iOS calendar app.
If you're synching with iCal on a mac, you add the event to iCal and go into the "custom" recurrence settings, and it's easy to have it repeat every two days.
Sync your device and bob's your uncle.
