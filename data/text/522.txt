Q: How can I turn my iPhone into a tv remote control? Which software/hardware can turn my iPhone into a decent remote control for my TV?
(Are there any reviews out there that compare the options?)

A: You'll need an IR dongle (the iPhone doesn't natively have any IR capabilities). Google for iPhone IR remote and you'll see several options.

A: Some of the new internet-connected TVs can be controlled via WiFi using apps available in the App Store. Here's an example for 2010 model Samsung Internet@TVs.

A: The Griffin Beacon looks like it should do what you want. It combines an iPhone app with an IR emitter that you place on a table and control via Bluetooth.

A: My entertainment system is basically a PC plugged in to a flat screen TV, so I've found apps like this work well:
