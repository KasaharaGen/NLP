Q: iPhone: Is it possible to gift paid app to another user? Is it possible to gift apps to another iTunes account ?
I want to accomplish the following:
Select payed application → Gift to friend → Payment of app → Send to friend → Friend can download it as a gift (for free)
Is that possible ? And if yes, how can I do that ?
Please provide me some links or detail for this idea.

A: Yes, this is possible for Apps and music. For obvious reasons, you can only gift Apps that cost money. Unfortunately this is not possible with books from the iBook store.
