Q: How can I export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail? I want to export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail. How can I do this?

A: Do it via an IMAP server, which you can install on the Mac. I used dovecot, created an account on it, added that account to Outlook and just moved it all over. Then in Mail, I created the same account, and copied everything over.
I prefer this method because it completely preserves all the properties of each message, including attachments. Exporting and importing through another method (including Thunderbird) doesn't preserve everything properly.

A: You can use Outlook2Mail. It can export mails, contacts and calendar entries.
But there are a few caveats:


*

*12,95USD

*Only U.S./English versions of Windows and Outlook are supported at this time. Little Machines does not guarantee the successful conversion of non-English characters, languages other than English and date formats outside of the United States.

*You need a computer which is still running Outlook to export. You can't just copy the PST to your Mac and convert it.
