How do I change the location of screen captures on 10.5? 

In the Keyboard preferences, I enabled the shortcuts that allow me to take a screenshot of the full screen, or of the part I select.
Is there a way to select in which directory will the file be saved? 

A: You can use TinkerTool to change your "Screenshot file format" and "Target Folder for Screenshot"
