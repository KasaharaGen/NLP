Q: When will Endnote X4 for Mac be compatible with Word for Mac 2011? In the meantime, how can one manage?

A: According to their website:

EndNote X4 is not compatible with Word 2011. The compatibility of Word 2011 with EndNote X4 will be addressed in a free update. Please register your software to be informed when EndNote X4 is compatible with Word 2011.

On their message board, this message says:

The schedule has changed since then so I cannot provide a firm ETA, other than we're now targeting the first quarter of 2011.

From the later comments in that thread (and other threads in their forum), there appear to be a lot of unhappy customers.
Your other options appear to be:


*

*Use X4 with MS Word 2008 (and thankfully, you can run 2008 and 2011 apps at the same time)

*Use X4 with Pages '09

*Use X3 with MS Word 2011

*Apply to beta test the Word 2011 version of X4

*Don't use Endnote; instead just use Word 2011's built-in tools
