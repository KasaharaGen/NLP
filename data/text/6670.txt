Q: How to make some space on iPad? Is there a way to delete music, podcast or iTunes-U to make some space available (to take more pictures for instance) without a computer ?

A: You can delete videos from the Videos app by tapping and holding on the thumbnail, then pressing the red X that appears in the corner (just like deleting apps from your home screen).
To delete audio podcasts, find them in the Music app, swipe your finger across the name of the podcast (or episode) and press the delete button. (The same way you would with emails.)
