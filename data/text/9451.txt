Q: Drag & drop and cut & paste not working 
Possible Duplicate:
Can anyone explain this clipboard behaviour? 

This is weird. I'm on OSX Lion, and sometimes both drag & drop and cut & paste stop working, at the same time. They stop working in any program, not just the Finder. And it's not just the shortcut: if I try to right click and select "Copy" it doesn't work either. 
This has happened three times so far. A reboot fixes it, but it's annoying at best. Anyone with the same problem? Any solution?

A: Well, since the question is “Anyone with the same problem”: yes, it seems at least another StackExchange user has the same problem in “Can anyone explain this clipboard behaviour?”.
