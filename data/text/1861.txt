Q: How to  use the built–in VPN Server on Mac OS 10.6.6 I know that Mac OS 10.6.6 has a built in VPN server that one can access through command line. Is there an easier way? Can I make an Automator or AppleScript program that starts and stops the built–in VPN server? I have Developer tools installed.
I see that there are several paid software front–ends, like "iVPN", yet I would rather learn how to do this by myself. 
The man pages are a bit thick for me. But if I could find a step by step walk through then maybe I could parse the man pages.

A: Looks like this is what you're after, though I haven't tried it myself.
