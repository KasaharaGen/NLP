Q: Is there a dashboard widget that displays Google Maps and traffic data overlay?   Is there a dashboard widget available that displays Google Maps with traffic data?

A: You can make one yourself using the unsung "Open in Dashboard..." command in Safari.


*

*Open Google Maps in Safari. Adjust the size of the window so the map the size you would like the widget to be.

*In Safari, go to the File menu, then "Open in Dashboard." You'll get a little hover in Safari. Place the cursor in the upper left part of the map so that the entire map, and just the entire map, is highlighted. It may be a bit finicky to get the map highlighted properly, so just keep at it and it will be fine. 

*Click add in the top of the browser. Done!
You now have a Google Map widget that acts just like Google Maps in the browser. Navigate to where you want to see traffic, enable traffic in the widget, and you're done.

A: No, however there are a couple of other traffic widgets.
