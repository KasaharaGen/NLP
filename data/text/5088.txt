Q: Can I write an Automator/AppleScript script to download all the iTunes app updates? This is related to How can I tell iTunes to always download free updates
I would like to write a script to tell iTunes to download all the free app updates available, and have that script run regularly using iCal. Is this possible?

A: At the moment this feature is currently not available or easy to implement. There has been mention that the next version of iOS and iTunes may include this feature. But its all speculative until it is actually released.
