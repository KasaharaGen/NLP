Q: Do Macbooks with protective cases fit into the BookArc Desktop Stand? I have a 15" Macbook Pro in a Speck protective case. 
Will this fit into a Twelve South BookArc Desktop Stand for Notebooks comfortably? The protective case adds a little to the body of the Macbook, my concern is that it won't fit.



A: It works great with the Speck case, just go up an insert size and you're good. Check this out for some pictures of a similar setup: http://www.runaroundtech.com/2011/03/25/review-bookarc/
