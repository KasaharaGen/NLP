Q: Consolidating music from three drives to one I am trying to consolidate my music and videos on my Laptop. It is in 3 places:


*

*C:\Users\RajMore\Music

*D:\Entertainment\Audio

*E:\Entertainment\Audio


I want to put all the music in a single location C:\Users\RajMore\Music so that I can carry a single laptop and not have to worry about taking my External HDD or having to remove the D drive to put in my DVD drive.
I have just about 60 GB of music. 10 GB on C, 20 G on D and 30 GB on E. I have 86 GB free on C, so space is not at a premium.
Metadata is the stuff about the music / video that is not stored in the music / video item - it is stored in ITunes.  For example: Start of song, end of song, rating (I use this when for good songs to DJ), video start time and end time etc.
How do I do this and not lose metadata regarding the music and videos?

A: Under Prefs > Advanced set the Media Folder to your chosen location on C:
Then, File Menu > Library SubMenu > Organize Library.
Select "Consolidate Files".
