Q: What are the development tools on the Mac? Are there any development tools like NetBeans or Eclipse on OS X that I can use to write an application?

A: Xcode was good for your job. If you want use NetBeans and Eclipse on your Mac, you can download them, too, because they have OS X distributions.

*Netbeans

A: If you are looking for Java development on the Mac, both NetBeans and Eclipse have a distribution for Mac OS X. Xcode also has support for Java, but it is not a Java-centric tool.

A: There are built-in vim and emacs. Both of them can be used as IDE.
Built-in vim and emacs don't have GUI (only console versions) but at least they are relatively new in latest OSX versions.
If you want GUI versions there are MacVim and a couple of GUI emacses for OSX.
