Q: is there a way to create an AFP link to point to any user's home directory? I would like to send a link via email to a file that everyone has in their Dropbox. The file exists on everyone's machine in the same relative location, however everyone has a different User Name.
On my machine, the file is accessible at afp://Users/scott/Dropbox/shared/example.pdf
Unfortunately, afp://~/Dropbox/shared/example.pdf does not work.
I am running Lion (10.7.1), most others are as well, a few are running Snow Leopard (10.6.x)

A: Well simplest way would be ~/Dropbox/shared/example.pdf (~ denotes user folder) but that will not probably work right from email.
You have to put it in Finder's 'Go to Folder...' dialog window which you can invoke with cmd+shift+G shortcut.

A: Create an applescript as a simple .app:
Open Applescript Editor, Paste in: 
tell application "Finder"
activate


-------------------------------------
-- CHANGE This setting TO the PATH 
-- (no leading slash)
-- Don't include home folder. That's done below. 
-- -- If the full path is "HardDrive/Username/Desktop/Folder1/fine.txt": 
-- -- set filepath to "Desktop/Folder1/fine.txt"

set filepath to "Desktop/filename.pdf"

-------------------------------------

set myPath to (path to home folder) as string

set filepath to POSIX path of myPath & filepath
try
    set command to "open " & quoted form of filepath
    do shell script command
end try 

end tell

You can then Save as..., and Select APPLICATION as the file type. 
Anytime this new app is launched, it will open the folder/file specified, relative to their home directory.  

A: You could try file://~/Dropbox/shared/example.pdf or file://$HOME/Dropbox/shared/example.pdf.
