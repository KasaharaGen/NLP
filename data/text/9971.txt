Q: Is is possible to go invisible in iChat? I want to be able to go invisible in iChat, like I can via Gmail. How can I do this?

A: When using Gmail in iChat before 10.7 you can't go invisible. I'm using Adium to be able to go invisible when I login via Gmail.

A: Yes, just click on the Green light that says available and you will had all these options as in the picture below.
