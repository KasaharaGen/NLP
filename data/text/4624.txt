Q: Is there an offline RSS Reader for Mac OS X? I'm looking for an offline RSS reader, which also downloads images embedded into the feed.
I've tried (and liked) NetNewsWire (and the Lite Version of it), but it does not seem to store embedded images for offline viewing, which is a must for me.
I've no other requirements except this, so it doesn't matter if it syncs to Google Reader or to iOS.
Does anybody know of an application that can actually accomplish this?

A: Reeder supports offline reading of your RSS feed. It will fetch and cache a configurable amount of feed history for you to peruse while you aren't connected to the web. And it'll look darn good while doing it. (Can you tell I'm a fan?)
