Q: How do I add a song to a playlist on an iPod Device (running iOS4)? It seems like this should be simple, but I can't seem to find the right place to click. 
I see how I can go into edit mode for a playlist and remove songs. I just can't figure out how to add songs to a playlist on the device. Ideally I'd like to be able to do it from the now-playing screen somehow, but any solution is acceptable as long as it doesn't involve connecting to my computer and using iTunes to do the add.

A: On the device, in the tab bar, select Playlists, then select the playlist you want to edit. Press the Edit button, then in the top right corner is a plus sign. Tap the plus sign to add tracks to a playlist on your iOS4 device.
