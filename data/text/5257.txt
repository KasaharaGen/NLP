Q: How can I create iPhone screenshots without the lock button? Is there any way to create a screenshot of an iPhone without using the combination home+lock button? Is there an app for jailbroken phones? Something else?
I do not have a Mac; only Windows.

A: Yes, there is. After you have jailbroken, install Activator. In there you can assign another activation method for taking a screen shot. Good luck!

A: I just found out the solution: go to the Activator app, click on a gesture you want to use, keep scrolling down until you find "Take A Screenshot". Mine is now set up to where I can push both volume buttons simultaneously and bam, screen shot captured!

A: Go to settings>General>Accessibility>Scroll down>AssistiveTouch
Turn it on.
Then you just click the home button and it gives you the option of screenshot if you do this:
Click device>More>Screenshot and you are done! 

A: An alternative would be to simply take a picture of the screen with a camera.

A: I'm sure there is not another way to do screenshots.
