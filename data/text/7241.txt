Q: Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 SDK installation problem on Mac OS X Lion I recently brought a new Mac mini running Max OS X 10.7 Lion.
I downloaded the iOS SDK 4.3 and Xcode 3.2.6.dmg from Apple.
The download was successful and I was able to install it without any problem. But after installing, I cannot find Xcode in the /Developer/Applications folder.
All I do see there are performance tools and utilities folders.
Can anybody help me in properly installing Xcode on Lion?

A: For Lion you need Xcode 4 (not 3.2) This is available from the App Store or from a paid Developer account).
This will install the installer in /Applications, run this to install Xcode to /Developer

A: Look again in Applications. There's an Install Xcode application.
Run it.
