Q: Managing second iPhoto library with some albums and events from first library My iPhoto library is very fat already. I have about 90GB in it. I want to make a new one and label it 2012-present with the old one something like 2000-2011.
However I do sync my iOS devices with my iPhoto library, and I want some of the recent events and albums to be included in my new library so I can keep syncing them to my iPhone. Is there any way to copy the albums/events or make the other library see the albums/events?
In general, I do want to keep it in just one library, since iPhoto should be able to detect faces, show geotagged photo map, etc. However I may not do that for a while until I upgrade to a new computer :( (this is another big problem for me)

A: Another option would be to get iPhoto Library Manager:

iPhoto Library Manager allows you to organize your photos among multiple iPhoto libraries, rather than having to store all of your photos in one giant library.
iPhoto Library Manager lets you easily create and keep track of multiple iPhoto libraries, but that's only the beginning. It also has the ability to copy your photos from one library to another, while keeping track of photo metadata that is normally lost when exporting from one library and importing into another.
Titles, dates, descriptions, keywords, ratings, faces, and place information are all transferred along with the photos, ensuring that you keep all that information you spent hours entering into iPhoto. iPhoto Library Manager also reconstructs events and albums with the same photos as they had in the library they came from, as well as retaining both the edited and original copies of each photo. You can split up a large library into multiple smaller libraries, merge entire libraries together into a big one, and much more!



A: You'll have to copy the media from said events in the first library to the second one, and create albums/events in the second library as necessary.
