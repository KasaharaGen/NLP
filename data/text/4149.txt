Q: Use MacVim as standard Terminal? I used to love the terminal.app for many reasons.
I especially liked the way I could navigate to a file and edit using vim it all in one app, without having to leave the keyboard. 
But, since the terminal.app doesn't support many of vim's rich features, I decided to make the step to MacVim. 
This breaks the symmetry though, I have to use terminal.app to navigate to a file, edit in MacVim (using mvim of course), quit MacVim and open up the terminal again. 
Isn't there a way to use MacVim in stead of terminal to do all this? I'm not talking about iTerm 2 etc, these apps don't cut is for me. I'm talking about true unix command line in MacVim.. 
This should be possible, I guess, only... is it?

A: This is an old thread, but just in case someone else has this question:
mvim -v

A: If you are looking to navigate and open your files from within VIM, there are a couple things I suggest trying out.
:Sex
:Sex in VIM or MacVim splits the screen and lets you navigate the file system to find a file.  I have this bound to ;o in my install.  
NERDTree
NERDTree is a VIM add-on that gives you a navigable tree view of the filesystem on the left-hand side of VIM.  :NERDTreeToggle ~/path/to/whatever/ will open NERDTree for you, and the root of the tree will be ~/path/to/whatever/.  In my VIM installs I use my home directory, and have it aliased to Control+o in .vimrc:
map <C-O> :NERDTreeToggle ~/<CR>


A: You're confusing the terminal with the text editor, as other commenters have pointed out. Still, there are a number of ways to make the terminal more vim-like, or vim more terminal-like.
If it's vi-style keybindings in the terminal you're after, add set -o vi to your ~/.bash_profile (assuming you're using bash). This will allow you to use vi-style keybindings at the command line (hjkl movement, modal editing, etc.)
If you just want to be able to execute unix commands from within vim, prepend ! to the beginning of those commands at the (Mac)Vim command line. For example :!pwd will print the working directory.
There are also plugins like Conque which allow you to run a shell from within Vim, which sounds like it may be exactly what you're after.

A: At least now, in 2020, this is built into MacVim. You can open the terminal with :terminal and you can navigate to and from it by tapping <C-w> twice.
For more information on usage, type :help terminal.
