Q: Unable to display 1920x1080 on a 1080 monitor I have a Macbook Pro 15" i5, and I'm connecting it to a Samsung 40" 1080p monitor.
Previously, it displayed a 1920x1080 resolution just fine, but then I accidentally changed something in the OSX Display preferences,  and the monitor is unable to display 1080p; it only displays resolutions of 1600x1200 and below.
When I select 1920x1080 the monitor displays the message "mode not supported."
I think I messed up by changing the rotation of the external monitor to 270 or something; I tried restoring the default values, but it still doesn't work.
