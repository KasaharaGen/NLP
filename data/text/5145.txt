Q: live screencasting solution that supports Power PC Macs I have a Power PC and I have been wanting to do a live screencast of a this thing I do, but there doesn't seem to be a single widget out there that would help me out.
It is not just a matter of grabbing the screen, I have Snapz Pro X and it will work, but I want to share it with a bunch of people in real-time. There is no love for the Power PC architecture.
Any ideas?
:(

Or this (More promising, as it is live):

A: What about VNC? There is a good server for mac that I used to use named Vine Server.
Or you could just use the built in one:


*

*Open System Preferences

*Go to Sharing

*Tick the "Screen Sharing" box

*Open "Computer Preferences" and make sure the "Allow VNC users to control the screen with a password" box is unticked


And then, on the viewing machine:


*

*Open Safari

*Go to "vnc://hostname/" where hostname is the ip address/hostname of the server machine
