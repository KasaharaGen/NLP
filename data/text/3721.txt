Q: In Finder's List view, is there a keyboard shortcut to go to top/bottom of list? Before Leopard, hitting the Spacebar would take you to the bottom file in List view -- but that now initiates QuickLook. As far as I know there has never been a keyboard shortcut to go to the top of the list. Or am I just ignorant?

A: Yep!  You can use opt-↑ to jump to the top of the list and opt-↓ to jump to the bottom.

A: Control-Option-Up and Control-Option-Down appear to work in El Capitan.

A: In macOS Big Sur (Version 11), when viewing items in list view in Finder, the keyboard shortcut  Control-Option-Up Arrow selects the first/top item in the list and the keyboard shortcut Control-Option-Down Arrow selects the last/bottom item in the list. These keyboard shortcuts do not work in icon view.

A: In MacOS Monterey, the best shortcut is +⬅️ (fn+left arrow) to scroll to the top in list view or icon view in finder. fn+arrows can also page up or down, or scroll to the bottom in finder. These also work in other apps like Safari, Chrome and any apps with scrollable content.
This likely also works in Big Sur and earlier MacOS releases as well, like Mojave, High Sierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, etc because I've known about this for a long time. Surprised not many others knew.
