Q: What parts can you upgrade on a MacBook Pro? If I buy a MacBook Pro, what parts can I upgrade later?
Is it possible to upgrade to more memory? Is it possible to upgrade to another harddrive? e.g. to a newer SSD-drive? Anything else that is possible to upgrade?

A: In addition to Am1rr3za's answers (other than the CPU, which is soldered to the logic board), you can also convert the optical drive bay to a caddy which houses a second hard drive or solid state drive.  This is a huge upgrade if you can stand being without an internal disc drive...

A: It depends on how much you care about your warranty.
If you want to keep your warranty valid, Apple says you can upgrade your hard drive and your RAMâ€”and that's all.
To learn how to do it, here are Apple's user manuals and page references for the current (mid-2010) MacBook Pros:


*

*13" (pages 37-48)

*15" (pages 37-48)

*17" (pages 37-49)

A: Yes, you can upgrade some parts of your MacBook Pro:


*

*Upgrade your hard drive.

*Upgrade to more memory.

*You can also upgrade CPU and WiFi Card.

*You won't be able to upgrade the graphics card on the MBP. It's soldered onto the motherboard.
