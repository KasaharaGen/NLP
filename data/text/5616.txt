Q: Dictionary is showing strange characters when "US English (IPA)" is selected I was using the Dictionary application, and I have noticed it was showing the pronunciation using strange characters.

I checked the preferences, and they were set to use the American IPA characters. 

Out of curiosity, I changed the option to "US English (Diacritical)"; I then re-typed the same word, and I have got this:
 
It seems that it uses diacritical characters when it should use IPA, and vice versa. Something changed in the last twenty-four hours, as it was working fine, the last time I used it.
I think the problem is one of the preference files used by the Dictionary application. Which file should I restore, to get back the Dictionary application working as it is supposed to do?
Could it be another problem? Which one could be causing this?

A: I also see |"br{k@t| when viewing bracket with US English IPA on a local Snow Leopard installation.
But, it is not a problem displaying the IPA characters themselves. Other words that shared those mis-transcribed vowel sounds are displayed correctly:


*

*bracket |"br{k@t|

*brackish |ˈbrækɪʃ|

*bran |bræn|

*kit |kɪt|
My guess it that there is just an error in the US English IPA transcription for bracket.
