Q: How to import contacts from Samsung E1170? I have a Samsung E1170 mobile phone and a USB datacable for it.

*How can I import/copy the contacts from the phone to my computer?

*Is there any application for Mac which can do that?

*If not, how can I do that at all in principle?


(Question on Superuser.)

A: Before 10.7 Mac OS included an application called iSync for exactly that. If you're still running Snow Leopard or lower you might want to look for an iSync plugin for your phone.
