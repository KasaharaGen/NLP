Q: How do I unset an IP address set with ifconfig? I recently used ifconfig en1 1.2.3.4 to set the IP address of a network interface (specifically, the wireless card) on a Mac… How can I remove/unset it?
Using the graphical network configuration tool doesn't seem to change (or even be aware of) this address - when I use it to manually set an address, a second address is added to the device.
For example, right now ifconfig shows:
en1: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
    ether 00:23:xx:xx:xx:xx 
    inet 192.168.141.99 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.141.255
    inet 192.168.1.112 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
    media: autoselect
    status: active

The first address -  141.99 - is the address I manually set. The second address — 1.112 — is the address assigned by my network's DHCP server.

A: Use delete:
ifconfig en1 delete 192.168.141.99


A: To clear all ip address associated with en1:
sudo ifconfig en1 0.0.0.0


A: I believe a reboot should reset it.

A: Try:
sudo ifconfig en1 down
sudo ifconfig en1 up


A: Sounds like you are looking to change the device en1 from 'static' to 'dhcp'. To do this perform the following: 
sudo ipconfig set en1 BOOTP
sudo ipconfig set en1 DHCP

After making the config changes you will need to bring that interface down and back up:
sudo ifconfig en1 down
sudo ifconfig en1 up


A: Try :
ifconfig en* down detach delete
