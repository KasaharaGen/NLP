Q: Xcode not letting me open a specific project When i try to open a specific project in xcode (i can open my other projects just not the most important one) i get this error 

I have gone in "Get Info" and made sure my account had complete access, but i still get this stupid error and i have no idea why. I am also the administrator for my computer and logged into my only account for this computer (i have not made multiple accounts) Can someone please help. 
- Thanks

A: Open terminal and type
sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/project_folder

NOTE: the capital R in the command above. Obviously change the path to your project folder to what it actually is.
If that command works without error,  but you still cannot open the project, then it isn't in fact a permissions problem but another bug in XCode.
You're not the first person to report this error however. Hopefully the above sorts it out for you.  Let me know.
