Q: How do I add attachments in iPad Mail? My friend has an iPad 2 and we can't seem to find a way to attach photos to emails using the standard Mail software the device comes with.
What are we missing?

A: It doesn't work this way. 
You can add images by 


*

*going to the Photos app, 

*selecting the pictures you want to add
(I believe it's a button on the upper right of the screen to switch to selection mode), 

*and tap on Copy, once you selected them,

*then you can go back to your mail, tap where you want to add them

*and select Paste

A: That's right (and sometimes rather confusing). To add pictures to a message, you start in the Photo app and select pictures to share. You can then either send the pictures directly from Photos or copy them to the clipboard and paste them into your emai afterwards.
