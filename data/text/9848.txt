Q: How can I setup Transmit along with Sidestep? I'm using Sidestep to securely connect the Internet from everywhere I am. I have my own server as an SSH proxy.
But I'm facing trouble with Transmit which doesn't seem to use the proxy settings defined by Sitestep.
I know there are some options available in Transmit to configure a proxy server, but since I really don't know much about proxy, SOCKS and stuff. I didn't succeed.
From all my tests, Transmit always seems to use the direct connection without going through the proxy.
Any hints?
Thanks,
Jérémy
