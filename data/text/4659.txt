Q: How can I copy and paste multiple texts? I would like to copy several different texts/things at the same time and paste them in any order.
Does anyone know any good Mac OS X software or plugin that can handle multiple copy/paste? 

A: Several app launchers also have clipboard history functionality built-in. I personally use LaunchBar, which supports clipboard history for up to 40 items. I previously used Quicksilver before development ceased - though I understand it's now back in development.

A: Check this: http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/
Cited from the above:

Jumpcut is an application that provides "clipboard buffering" â€” that
  is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've
  subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's
  interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your
  clipboard's history.

does many more things in fact, but indeed does the multiclip well...

A: I use ClipMenu to handle multiple clipboards. It's nice, has lots of features and it's free.

A: I wrote CmdVees to scratch my own itch. It solves my specific problem with copy/paste. It may fit your needs.

A: I wrote this one (no installer, just source): http://github.com/sje397/Clint
Very simple, but quite hackable and works on all platforms supported by Qt and you can network it so that you can share the clipboard across multiple computers.
