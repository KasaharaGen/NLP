Q: I am seeking a SCP/SFTP client for iOS devices There are clients for telnet and SSH but I couldn't find any app including SCP. Is there any?

A: I use a combination of two apps to administer local servers without internet access. There might be a good scp/sftp app I don't know - but AirSharing does file serving so well that I just turn it on then ssh into the server. From there, I sftp/curl the files I need back from the iOS file server.

*Prompt - a great ssh app by Panic.

*Air Sharing Pro - a file server that supports webdav/sftp/curl/http

A: Found something more useful. Textastic works with SFTP.
