Q: Help mac share files with XP machine on different subnets I have a personal Macbook running Lion (10.7.1) and a Company issued laptop running XP at work.
I want to access the files on the mac from XP on a regular basis. Right now using "sneaker net", i.e. swapping USB stick – but keeping files in sync is a challenge/worry.
The machines are on different networks (subnets) – the XP machine on the 'corporate' locked down network, and the mac on a slightly looser managed wireless 'guest' network. Changing settings on either network is not possible.
The corporate network blocks file sharing services like dropbox.
Any clever ideas on how I can share files across these two machines (which are literally 6 inches apart!)?
I tried using mac SMB file sharing, but crossing subnets seems like a no-go. I do have personal hosted web space available, but setting up syncing (maybe Goodsync) with both machines and encrypting files on the server would be a big hassle.
So, is there some relatively easy way to do this I'm missing, or have I been completely stymied by my corporate IT overlords?
Thanks for any ideas!

A: There is USBG-MAC-PC cable which does exactly what you want. It doesn't require installation of any drivers or any intervention of your company admins.
Here some guy shows how it works: http://www.usbgear.com/link/index.html .
Note, that he shows different cable model, the one that you need is on the bottom of the page.
