Q: Unscrupulous apps on iTunes -- bank account hacked by iTunes merchant? I recently had $500 stolen from my bank account via the iTunes store. I am not certain whether the charges are directly from Apple or via some other company whose iPhone app has somehow circumvented whatever security is on the system.
The specifics are that I had 3 phantom charges amounting to just under $500 on my credit card, but there were no charges on my itunes statement!
Apple of course will not even look at the case. It is the job of 'local law enforcement and credit card companies to assure that your account has not been compromised'.
I am looking for somewhere that has compiles/maintains a list of unscrupulous/hacked/hacking iphone apps so that I can compare the applications that are on my phone with untrustworthy ones.  Also, if anyone has advice with respect to cutting through the bureaucracy and receiving real support from Apple, that would be appreciated.

A: Forget about working with Apple. Just tell your credit card company.
