Q: iTunes fails to subsribe to a podcast I am using iTunes 10.2 on Windows 7 32bit
I am trying to subscribe to a video podcast (Tekzilla) and I am getting an error message.

I've been trying to do that for a couple of days and I'm getting the same error message so I guess the problem is on my side, somehow....

A: Try subscribing directly to the feed.
Under the "advanced" menu, select "subscribe to podcastâ€¦". Then, enter one of the feeds found on Tekzilla's website.

A: Found the issue. removing all the iTunes rules from the Windows Firewall and adding a single rule that allows all traffic for the iTunes executable solves this issue.
