Q: Growl Notifications for Stack Exchange websites? I'm looking for a way to get Growl notifications for new questions on the Stack Exchange websites, matching some pre-defined tags.
I've tried SENotify, but it didn't work for me. Any alternative?

A: I get Stack Exchange Growl notifications using Adium + Stackguru.


A: RSS Growler + feeds?

A: Have a look to Newt on StackApps, I'm currently using it and it's a pretty neat and solid app.
