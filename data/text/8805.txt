Q: How can I change default settings for HP Laserjet Pro 100 Color MFP 175? I've already created a new Preset configuration, but I cannot set it as the new default settings.
Anyone has any clues on achieving this?

A: What happens if you set the default settings from the browser going to the address http://localhost:631?
For example, I go to http://localhost:631/printers/Canon_MX310_series and from there clicking on administration I can choose: Set Default Options. Those set there usually get respected.
