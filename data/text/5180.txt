Q: How to undo SetFile -a V? I used SetFile -a V "/Volumes/Backup di Time Machine"/ to get rid off the time machine's icon on the desktop but it seems that I don't see it in the finder too and Time Machine stops working, it can't find the drive!
So how to undo this?
Thanks
P.S. stay away from this devil trick ;)

A: I found the solution. Just type the attribute V lowercase and restart the Finder!:)
