Q: Alternative methods for viewing flash content on the iPad? Is there currently a way to view flash content on an iPad besides VNCing to a desktop computer?
Currently you can connect a VNC client to a desktop computer to view flash content, but I am looking for alternative methods above and beyond that.
Is there any other ways to use Flash (and/or play Facebook games) on the iPad besides the VNC based method?

A: Unfortunately Apple generally doesnt allow stuff like running some generic program on a virtual machine in their OS, but there are apps which do conversion and make it ready for an iOS device such as iSWiFTER, which even claims it can convert games.
I have never tried these out, but iSWiFTER is a 30 second free trial, so see if it works for you.

A: Splashtop is an iPad app with desktop component that does a much better job of streaming video than other solutions.  Generally, you can fill the iPad's screen at 30fps with it over a wifi connection with no jitters. It claims audio support but I've not tested that part of it.  It should do just fine for streaming Flash 

A: Jailbreak then install Frash..
