Q: Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? I was told not by AT&T not to remove my SIM card or certain restrictions that they had placed on the iPhone, at my request, would be lifted. I want to know if upgrading my iOS is like removing the SIM card. I think this was because the IMEI number changes when the SIM card is removed from the phone.
Does upgrading iOS change this number?

A: The IMEI is kind of like a MAC address for the cellular network only. It is nearly impossible to change it, you can only spoof it on a software level. So the answer is, No, your IMEI will never change unless you really really want it to. Removing the SIM card shouldn't change the IMEI either...

A: The IMEI shouldn’t change when you upgrade the phone, at least here in Europe. Mine is still the same. 
Update: Upon some reading around, it turns out that if you “hack” your phone, (maybe in the past), an update would change some IMEIs, and AT&T would therefore invalidate the SIM. Be careful with what you do :)

A: No, upgrading the OS doesnt change the IMEI by default, there are hacks available to do it, but its illegal and hence, not recommended. 

A: No. Upgrading iOS won't change the IMEI of your iPhone.
