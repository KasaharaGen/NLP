Q: Changing default app to open a certain extension, but keeping the previous icon? I use TextWrangler to open code files, such as .php, .ccs, .js, etc.  
But it assigns the same icon to every file. How can I get the original icons back to each extension while TextWrangler is still the default app to open them?

A: The behavior you want is what happens when using Xcode as the default application.
The behavior you want is not possible with TextWrangler for the following reason: 
Textwrangler does not distinguish the icons for *.php *.ccs... like Xcode. Therefore it does not store different icons for different filetypes (PHP.icns, CCS.icns...). 
Instead TextWrangler only stores one icon for all filetypes: TextWranglerTextDoc.icns
This icon is located at:


*

*right-click on TextWrangler -> show package contents

*navigate to .../Contents/Resources/TextWranglerTextDoc.icns
