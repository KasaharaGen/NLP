Q: iMovie export to Ogg Theora? After I finish editing a movie with iMovie '09 under Mac OS X 10.6.4, is there a way to export the final product to Ogg Theora format? OR, is there a way to convert an already exported movie to Ogg Theora easily?

A: As part of Dive Into HTML5, Mark Pilgrim gives two options:


*

*Encoding Ogg Video With Firefogg

*Batch Encoding Ogg Video With ffmpeg2theora
One or both of those should work for you.

A: Just install the XiphQT Quicktime plugin... allows any of the Quicktime-based OS X video players/editors, including iMovie, to export to Theora.
