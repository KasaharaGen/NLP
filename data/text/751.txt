Q: Is there a way to change iPhone backup location? I don't have enough disk space on my PC to store whatever is backed up by iPhone. Is there a way to change location to where iPhone backs up the data? I want to back it up to my external hard drive. 

A: It looks like you can if using Windows.
Is OS X the backups seems to be stored in the following location ...
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup

... but I don't think you can change that location.

A: You can, however, drop a copy of that folder to your external drive - or include that folder in whatever backup/clone app you're using.
