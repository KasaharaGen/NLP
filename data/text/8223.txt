Q: What's a good Font Manager for OS X? I am searching for a good font manager for Lion. It should work especially with google web fonts. 
I need a good overview of non-alphabetic unicode characters. And activating/deactivating would be great i.e. to check, if web pages I work on work well with fonts being installed or not.
So basically I need a font manager, that supports me for developing websites.

A: Font Case is the app you are looking for. It has activation/deactivation, web preview mode, glyph overviews, collections etc.
