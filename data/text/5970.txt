Q: What is a .apple extension? What is a .apple extension? I am recovering some files and I recovered several files with the .apple extension.

A: What does the terminal command file f0009024.apple show you about the files have.
It's highly unlikely they are truncated Apple Single or Apple Double files, but that's the only guess I have at the moment.

A: To decode AppleDouble, try this AppleScript
on run   
    tell application "Decode AppleFile"
        activate
        set outputFile to decode file "Macintosh HD:Desktop Folder:encoded:SomeFile.hqx"
        -- set outputFile to decode file "Macintosh HD:encoded:%aFile" data fork file "Macintosh HD:encoded:aFile"   end tell   tell application "Finder"
        activate
        select outputFile
        move selection to folder "Macintosh HD:decoded"   
    end tell 
end run
