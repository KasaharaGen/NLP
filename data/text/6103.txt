Q: Lion: background of the login screen I just updated to Lion and I'm wondering why the background of the locked screen (login screen) seem to be different everytime I look at it: it is either the grey texture, the default desktop background or a plain black background.
Why isn't it the same background all the time ?

A: If you are logging in fresh, it is grey linen.
If you are waking from sleep or display sleep without a screen saver enabled, it is the desktop background.
If you are waking from a screen saver, it is the screen saver itself.
Finally, if you are waking from display sleep or sleep after a screen saver has been ended by display sleep or sleep, it is a black background.
There does not appear to be a way to change this, but keep your eye on apps like Secrets.  If anyone's going to figure it out, it's them.
