Q: Mission Control slow and jerky on 2011 MacBook Pros: any fix? Mission Control has been horribly slow on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15" (2GHz quad i7, 8GB RAM, 256MB graphics, SSD) -- swiping up usually freezes the screen for 2 seconds, before showing me the Mission Control layout. I've tried switching to discrete graphics only, but the problem doesn't go away.
It seems others have been experiencing this, too, and it might be a video driver issue. Has anyone found a fix for this? One MacRumors forum post suggested disabling automatic scrollbar overlays, but that hasn't helped. 

A: Only a couple of suggestions, and neither is sure to work, but worth a try.
Safe boot - Start up in Safe mode with the Shift key held until the progress bar appears.  Select Restart (normally) at the login in window.  Safe boot mode does a Repair Disk during boot.
Re-install the OS - Your data and settings will be preserved.  There may have been a glitch in the original installation that could be fixed this way.
BTW, have you tested for this problem by logging in as a different User?
I have 3 Macs on Lion: 2007 iMac, 2009 mini, 2011 i7 MBP, none of which exhibit this problem.  This leads me to suspect that those with the problem have some 3rd party software in common, especially since it happens in such a wide range of Macs.
