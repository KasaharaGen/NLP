Q: Is it possible to do a "clean" install of Lion? Is it possible to take a Lion install burned by the method outlined in this question and preform a clean install with it?
I just want to make sure that if I buy Lion from the App Store in the near future that when the mood strikes me I will be able to reformat and install Lion without some previous install of Snow Leopard.

A: Yes, it is possible. It is bootable, and will be able to do a complete clean install (with you having to format the hard disk first).
Also, if you have installed Lion already, you would be able to do a reinstall by holding ‚å• Option on bootup and selecting Recovery HD. Wait for it to load, and you will be able to see an option for reinstalling.

A: Yes - Apple have published a very nice how to install lion that goes over the steps to install it internally as well as on a second drive.
