Q: Looking for an Evernote alternative with password lock I am looking for an Evernote alternative with the following requirements:


*

*Cloud syncing

*iPhone and iPad app

*passcode lock (with encryption) - Yes, Evernote can encode notes, but only from the desktop client. And I would prefer 1 global lock rather than encrypting all my notes one-by-one

*Evernote's rich text editor sucks and cannot be turned off, but I prefer plaintext

*An OS X native app would be great (but I don't mind if it's web only for the desktop)

*Nice to have: lists (like Wunderlist)

*Nice to have: private sharing with friends / colleagues / family members


Have you come across such an app?

A: I guess SimpleNote meet your requirements.


*

*It does sync to the cloud.

*The iOS app is universal

*You can lock the app with a passcode

*It's plaintext only

*There's no SimpleNote desktop app per se, but there's a public API and a lot of great software use it that you can find here.
And there's also a web app

*There's no list, but there are tags.

*You can share your notes.
