Q: Can I change the application icon of an Automator script? I have created a couple of automator scripts. I was curious if there is a way to change the application icon on those scripts to something other than the robot.

A: You can also change the icon just as you would normally for any other folder or file in Mac OS X:


*

*Copy the image you want to use as your icon. Ideally it should be 512x512 already.

*Choose Get Info on the file/folder/app in Finder

*Click on the Icon and you'll notice a blue outline on the icon - now press Command-V or choose Paste from the Edit menu.

A: To complement the existing, helpful answers:


*

*The accepted answer works in principle, but:


*

*relies on extended attributes of the HFS+ filesystem, which are lost when copying the bundle to a filesystem that doesn't support them. For instance, you cannot store a custom icon in a Git repository.

*the icon displayed by the bundle itself, such as when showing an alert, is still the original icon.


*percent 20's answer is more comprehensive and portable in principle, but comes with two caveats:


*

*Any changes to AutomatorApplet.icns are lost whenever you modify and re-save the bundle in Automator.
Thus, for instance, you'd need a script to put the updated icons in place programmatically every time the bundle is saved.

*As others have noted, there are icon caching issues, which can be tricky to resolve; as of OSX 10.10.4:


*

*Even a reboot doesn't make the new icons appear in Finder (though it does appear in other contexts such as in the Dock), but there are two workarounds: either (a) move the bundle to a different folder, or (b) rename the bundle; given that reverting to the original path and name makes the problem reappear, you'd have to plan ahead: create your bundle in a different location or with a different name, then move / rename to the desired location / name.

*Alternatively, you can use a tool such as OnyX and check IconServicesunder Cleaning > User to clear the cache.




A: I found a hacky way to do it after you have created the applet


*

*(Create your icns icon file - however you want)

*Open Applications Folder

*Right-click on automator script

*Click on view package contents

*Add your icon to resources folder

*Rename it to AutomatorApplet.icns


I am sure there is a better way, but I figured out how to do it this way.

A: After the script has been created do the following :


*

*Find the source app with the icon you want

*Get Info of the source app (cmd-i)

*Click on the icon inside the source app's info window
(Not the one in the big Preview section at the bottom, if you have one of those; the little one in the top-left corner.)

*Copy it (cmd-c)

*Get Info of the automator script (i.e., the destination app) (cmd-i)

*Click on the icon inside the destination app's info window

*Paste the icon from the clipboard (cmd-v)
This method works for every files in Mac OS X.


A: Apple's official page on customizing files and folders works great for this! 
For the sake of completeness, for others who view this, I am sharing this.

A: This seems a silly answer but it taught me a interest addittional info

Restore the original icon for an item
  
  
*
  
*On your Mac, select the file or folder, then choose File > Get Info.
  
*At the top of the Info window, select the custom icon, then choose
      Edit > Cut.

Only drawback about this simple apple hidden feature: You can't undo the 'Restore original' icon by executting cmd + z from just made from inside Get Info... Or so it seemed.
Lucky me, I noticed that my custom icon wasn't completly removed in all the places (still present in the top side of the Get Info and in the Finder window miniature I both left opened).
So I found out a simple cmd + z from Finder window reverted my disaster.
Maybe it should be safer to store the copy-pasted custom icon in Contents/Resources/description.rtfd inside Package Contents
