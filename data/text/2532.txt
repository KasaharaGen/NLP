Q: How do I exclude video podcasts from my podcast smart playlist I created a Smart Playlist to sync to my iPod Touch so I can listen to my podcasts one after the other while I'm on a long drive.

I can't figure out how to leave Video Podcasts off that list, though.  Is there a way?

A: Adding Kind contains 'audio'should do the trick. At least it's what I'm doing and it works.
Kind contains 'video' will give you the video Podcasts.
