Q: Is there an iPhone app for outlining that has a decent web/desktop companion? I am looking for an outliner app for iPhone, with either a desktop or web counterpart.

A: Evernote should work for you, there are web/desktop (PC/Mac) and iPad apps, as well as the iPhone app.

A: There is an app call Outliner for iPad and iPhone, which has an web companion.  It works for now, but I am waiting for OminiOutliner to come out in 2011 (for iPad, not for iPhone), which should be a much better solution.
