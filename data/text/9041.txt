Q: Upgrade SATA connection on MBP 3,1 When replacing my HDD in my MBP 3,1 with a SSD (SATA3), I noticed that the SATA1 cable can be fully removed.
Thus I thought, that it might be possible to replace the SATA 1 cable by a SATA 3 cable in order to boost my SSD use.
However, I do not know whether this is supported by the Logicboard... Any idea?

A: My best suggestion is that you try. Worst case it will downscale to SATA1/2 speed if it's all it can handle.
The easiest way to determine if your board will support the speed of SATA3 is to have a look at your Serial ATA settings in system information and check your link speed. It will show the supported speed and negotiated speed.
I have a MBP 6,2 which does support SATA3 on the board. I know my MB 3,1 only support SATA1, however it was always a low spec model compared to the MBP range and it may have been limited to save cost.
