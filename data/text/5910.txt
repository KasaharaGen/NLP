Q: Faint clicking noise in trackpad in Macbook Pro I recently purchased a Macbook pro, and I have some issue with my Trackpad. I notice that if I lightly press on it, I can hear a click (sometimes faint, sometimes clearly audible) but no click action is performed. If I firmly press, then the click goes through as expected, but instead of one clear click noise, I hear a faint click followed by a louder click.
Has anyone heard of this before? Is it normal behavior? If not, how should I go about fixing the problem? The laptop is under warranty, so do I simply go to an Apple store and ask them to fix it for me? If so, how long does it take to replace a trackpad? 
Thanks.

A: The Apple repair folks won't actually replace the trackpad  itself, but they will adjust the tensioner underneath the trackpad. I had the same issue in my brand new Macbook Pro, and they were able to solve the issue.

A: I have the same problem. I took it to the Apple Store and they looked at it and they didn't even open it up to see what is wrong. They just said I need to get a new trackpad that is $100.
