Q: Limit Growl to one app only Is it possible to limit Growl notifications to one App only? I'm really bothered by notifications by Adium, Bowtie and lots more but I don't want to deactivate each of them manually.
Something like a whitelist for Growl-enabled apps would come in quite handy here. Any ideas or suggestions?

A: Very simple: Go to System Preferences --> (other) Growl --> then choose the applications tab. From here you can choose which apps you want to give growl notifications.

A: The trick is to let everything alert you, but by default make the alerts invisible. For the one or two apps you want, customize them to be visible.
To make alerts invisible, under Display Options you could set it to default to SMS and give a bogus number, or find some other technique.
