Q: Is there a way to make Adium open links with Google Chrome? When someone sends me a link in Adium I'll click it and Safari will open up. I'd like links to be opened by Google Chrome instead.
I've had a look around the web and in the preferences but for the the life of me I can't figure this simple one out.
Any clues?
NB: My default browser is Google Chrome.
EDIT
I'm running version 1.4.1 (i.e. up-to-date). I use this SkypePlugin. Apart from that it's plain vanilla Adium.

A: Try to disable the Skype plugin, it must be tempering with the way Adium handles URLs opening.
