Q: How can I view the items in the Spotlight cache? I'd like to view the data spotlight has imported.  Is this possible?  
EDIT:  For example I can do this:
mdutil -svvv /Volumes/h8rdrive

and find out this volume was indexed.  
I'd kind of like to find out what's not indexed though.

A: mdfind is your friend here.
If you simply wanted a list of every file in your spotlight index you could do:
mdfind /

You can also get it to provide a count of the files.
mdfind -count /

On my system this returns 224353 which is a good reason not to run the first command!
