Q: Why would Preview save just my annotations? I was using Preview to annotate a screenshot for a question on Apple.StackExchange.com and I saved it. For some reason, it only saved my annotation. I must've spaced out and accidentally pressed something, but what might that something be?


A: Select All and Delete would have been done the trick :)  You've deleted the screenshot (which was in the background) but kept the annotations.
