Q: Installing mc (midnight commander) without root access? How do I do that? The normal installers (with .pkg files) ask for an admin password. It is possible to run normal mac software without admin access, but how do I run and install this shell software?

A: You can compile it yourself or use HomeBrew, that doesn't require root access.

A: Compile it elsewhere on a Mac where you do have the necessary tools installed. Move the binary over to the other machine.
