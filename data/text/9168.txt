Q: iPhone plays podcasts in seemingly random order Does anyone know why my iPhone has (suddenly) started playing podcasts in seemingly random order? I want podcasts to be played in the order they were downloaded (in iTunes), chronologically.
However, when I start listening to a podcast with more than two entries, the second entry iPhone plays is seldom the second in chronological order, but some seemingly random entry. Why is this and how can I fix it?
Update: Here's how the Music application's interface looks like on my iPhone:

I can't see a shuffle icon anywhere. The icon on the lower right hand side is the airplay icon. Here's a screenshot after tapping the "album art":

Here's a screenshot from while playing music:

There I can see a shuffle icon (finally), but it's not enabled (blue).

A: Did you have shuffle on while listening to music? If you did, the podcasts will also be shuffled.

A: I usually do a playlist and sort it based on whatever criteria I want. The order usually sticks well then.
Update: I use a smart playlist. Kind = Podcast and playcount = 0. From there you sort the playlist based on how you want it sorted. I then added rules to exclude from the podiobooks playlist and the music podcast playlist.
I had added others one for music and one for podiobooks. They where create by Kind = podcast and album = podcast name. I added one album = for each podcast in the list. I didn't add many after I had it setup so I didn't edit those much. 
The main list was then dynamically updated based on these other two lists. Simple and maintenance free.
