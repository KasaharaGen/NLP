Q: Can I use tethering to let an iPad use an iPhone's 3G? Given an iPad that doesn't have 3G but only wifi, can I make this use the 3G connection of an iPhone 4? 
Does this require a cable between the devices, or does it work over (bluetooth|wifi?) ?

A: I don't believe you can do this with the stock phone, however if you decide to jailbreakyour iPhone, you could use an application like MyWi to share your iPhone's 3G connection over WiFi

A: Official word here:

A: You can’t do this without Jailbraking your device (as correctly pointed by Rex). 
The iOS 4.x doesn’t (not even the latest developer 4.2) have a mechanism to tether with another iPhone/Pad. They can share their connection (via Bluetooth for example) but I haven’t seen a way to tell an iPhone -> pair with that other iPhone and use that internet connection. That is something a Macintosh computer can do, but I don’t believe you can do that with your iPad/Phone.

A: Yes, you can. I regularly tether my iPad 2 to my iPhone 4 via bluetooth. However you'll need an unlocked iPhone.
