Q: How can I rename a song in iTunes with a keyboard shortcut? I can hit the up and down arrows to navigate a playlist in iTunes 10.5 but hitting F2 doesn't allow me to rename a song.  I have to grab the mouse and do a finicky click, wait, click to highlight the song and then rename it.  Can I just assign F2 to this?  Or can I use an existing keyboard shortcut?
Incidentally, I know I can hit Command-I, and then Command-2, tab to Name, change the name, and hit Return, but this sub-optimal.
Bonus points if you can explain how I would assign such a shortcut to highlight the Genre of a song, which is my more common use case (long story).

A: *

*Press ↑ Up or ↓ Down to go to the track in iTunes.

*Press ⌘ cmd + ↩ return.

The track name will now highlight and become ready to edit

*Enter the text of the title.


*Press ↩ return to commit the renaming of the track.

I made a page of this (with pictures) at: http://sites.google.com/site/chrislent/home/rename-a-track-in-itunes-from-the-keyboard
See Apple KB Article PH12110 for an exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts.

A: fn + return works while navigating with the up and down keys.
Edit the song, then press return again to submit changes. 
For the other columns just press tab to reach the desired column.
