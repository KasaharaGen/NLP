Q: What is meant by Lemon Experience? I am not sure that is this the place to ask this question, but I heard of Lemon Experience on Mac. What does it mean? is it some hardware failure or software issue?

A: I believe the phrase you've heard is probably in reference to a faulty/dud piece of equipment, as per the definition:
"(informal) a person or thing, esp. an automobile,
regarded as unsatisfactory, disappointing, or feeble"

I don't think it's something Apple or Mac specific, and in fact is probably more often used with non Apple products.

A: In the US there is a body of law known as "lemon laws" that arose from car sales. Basically, if a car is sold to a consumer and the manufacturer is unable to remedy a specific covered fault after the consumer has presented the vehicle for numerous repair attempts, these laws provide additional protection to consumers. 
Perhaps this question might be migrated to a consumer law answer board unless someone can uncover a mac connection.
