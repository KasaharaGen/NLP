Q: How come I have 52GB of swap files?

Why does Finder use 59GB of swap space? 

So I have a regular (fresh) install of OSX Lion on my 2009 MBP, and I installed an SSD as the primary HDD prior to installing Lion. It's a 128GB SSD drive, but the system is using 52.6GB of this for it's swap files, which regularly results in zero space remaining on the drive and the system locking up. 

Any idea why it would be using so much space for this (please see the visualisation screenshot, above)?

A: The Original Poster explained that the answer was as follows:
I killed Sequel Pro that was using 2GB of RAM, and then ran:
$ sudo periodic daily weekly monthly
This had the effect (correct if wrong) of running some tasks which cleaned up the swap files. I now have between 30GB and 50GB space remaining (it's fluctuating..)
