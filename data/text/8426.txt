Q: iPhone 4 locked out while on holiday, how can I unlock it? I arrived in Greece yesterday and suddenly this morning my phone turned off, then on again and now it says Activation Required. When I unlock it to try and do it, I get the message:

This device is no registered as part of the iPhone Developer Program.##br####br##If you are a member of the Program, please register your device in the @@url@@

It is registered with the developer program. Is there any way I can fix this remotely? I don't have my computer.
Update 
I updated my phone via the new non beta iTunes to the new iOS5 as far as I'm aware. I'm pretty sure it just said 5.0. That was a couple of days ago. 
Also, I will be able to get to a computer with iTunes, but it won't be mine. 

A: I assume you, as a developer, have iOS5 installed? Try recovering from iCloud?
That is if you have backed up your iPhone using iCloud before of course. 
EDIT: Use a random computer to back-up your iPhone
