Q: CMOS Battery in MacBook Pro 2007 CMOS battery in my MacBook Pro (2007, pre-unibody) has died recently.
I am looking for a replacement, although all I could find so far was only used batteries off ebay.
It says following on the battery's shrink wrap: 
CR2025/USTC
PW3+3V
7 8 21

Under the shrink wrap it says:
Panasonic
CR2025
3V
Made in Malasya

So I am wondering if I could simply take a good quality CR2025 battery and use it instead of buying a used one? Or is this some super-secret version of CR2025 only Apple managed to get its hands on and I'd better off getting a used one, although straight of a MacBook Pro?

A: Any standard CR 2025 will do the trick.
