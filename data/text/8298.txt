Q: What do the Photo Stream settings in Aperture do? I understand that the iOS 5 Photo Stream is a collection of all of the recent photos taken on all iOS 5 devices in a given account, synced with those devices through the cloud. It is not clear to me, however, what the Photo Stream settings in Aperture do.

It appears that "Enable Photo Stream" simply connects Aperture to the Photo Stream and makes it available as a source for viewing and importing into Aperture; but it is not clear to me what "Automatic Import" and "Automatic Upload" do.

A: *

*Automatic Import: Imports any pictures received via Photo Stream into the main Aperture library. A copy will be created for this which remains even after the 1000th picture has been added to the stream and which can be edited
For this to work Aperture has to be open/running. If the 1000 picture threshold is reached while Aperture is not running, pictures will get lost irregardless of the setting of this option.


*Automatic Upload: Push any picture created in Aperture into the Photo Stream and on to all other connected devices

A: Automatic Upload:
Sends any photo added into your Aperture catalog into your overall Photo Stream.
Automatic Import:
When new photos are added into your overall Photo Stream Aperture will import them into your catalog and if there's facial recognition or geolocation information use that to filter and organize. 
I will admit I've not tried it, but everything I've read about it says that's what it does.
