Q: Preferences/General - How do I get it to save in Lion? I don't want my apps to open previous windows.  When I go into Prefs/General and unclick "Restore windows when quitting...," and close preferences, it doesn't save it.  When I re-open Prefs/General, it's checked again.
I can't change the preferences in anything.  Safari keeps opening the same last two windows and when I go into Safari Preferences and change "New tabs open with:" to 'Home Page'; once I close and open up again, it's back to 'Top Sites.'

A: Need to reset permissions? Try the following:


*

*Turn off computer

*Reboot Mac into Recovery (press and hold Command+R when you hear the chimes until a screen loads)

*Select "Disk Utility"


*Select your "Macintosh HD" volume on the left and press "Repair Disk Permissions"


*Once that has finished, reboot your computer
