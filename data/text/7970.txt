Q: iPhone 4S GPS accuracy Has the GPS chip been upgraded in the iPhone 4S? How does it compare to the 4 and 3GS?
As I understand it the GPS in iPhone 4 is much better than that in the 3GS.

A: The iPhone 4s, and the most recent iPhone 4 (Verizon) don't use a discrete GPS chip, as it's integrated into the baseband (Qualcomm MDM 6600). I believe the GPS chip in the iPhone 3GS used the Hammerhead II PMB 2540, or 2525 GPS chip. By integrating the GPS with the baseband it allows a smaller phone, less energy consumption, and cost less to produce.

The main improvements should be:


*

*Integration with Siri

*Updated antenna switching (spatial diversity)

*Improved TTFF and TTSF (fixes)

*Longer battery life (more energy efficient)


A: Just got the iPhone 4S - GPS reception is much better then iPhone 4.
I checked number of satellites the phone can see - using MotionX GPS app, same location, same time. The two phones was next to each other for 15 minutes, and I also swapped their location few times.

A: Since there is no official iPhone 4S delivered, I think there are no good records about this chip. All I can tell is the GPS accuracy improves with every iPhone model so far. 
iPhone 3G sucks at GPS, iPhone 3GS was a bit better, iPad 1 was accurate, iPhone 4 is excellent as well as the iPad 2.
So as technology keeps improving, I guess the chips used in Apple's iPhones will too.
