Q: Buyer information provided by Apple to Vendor for AppStore purchases Since I'm not currently selling anything in the apple appstore it would be nice if someone  who does could help me out with some details on the information Apple provides to the developer about the people purchasing your apps in the Mac/iOS Appstore. Do you get any personal information like the email address?
I'm asking this because I'm working on a multi platform SaaS solution and I'm evaluating if I the appstore(s) could be integrated into my own account management as just an alternative payment method.

A: Apple provide no uniquely identifying customer information for App store app purchases to developers.  iOS Developers only get a count of the number purchases per day/week/month for each country in which the app is enabled for sale.
