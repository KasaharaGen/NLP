Q: Double click to open documents and folders Before I installed Lion I was able to open folders and documents by using double click/tap on the trackpad. Now it doesn't work anymore. Did this happen to anyone else?
How do I resolve this problem?

A: Make sure tap to click is enabled:

If it still doesn't work more information is necessary.

A: Are you unable to select things with a single tap on the trackpad? Does physically clicking still work? 
When I installed Lion on my MacBook, it disabled the "tap-to-click" feature and I had to re-enable it in System Preferences > Trackpad.
