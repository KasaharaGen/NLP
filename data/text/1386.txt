Q: Using Hauppauge HD PVR and Mac Mini to Stream Game Video I recently acquired a Hauppauge HD PVR which my Xbox 360 is currently plugged into. I can record media from it using HD PVR Capture or use it as a TV Recorder via EyeTV. Unfortunately, I want to take the raw video stream, and hook it into something like a Justin.TV or LiveStream ProCaster for live streaming purposes, but I can't figure out how.
The PVR is not listed as a "video device" like a camera, so I cannot choose it as a video source. Since this is a MacMini, there are no registered video devices listed in any app on the Mini (say for example, iMovie's "Import From Camera" section).
How can I take the video feed going into my Mac Mini via USB, and re-use it immediately for any video-like purpose?

A: Argh, I wish I had seen this in time for the bounty.
I do broadcasts using Camtwist. Camtwist will become a video source and it does things like just broadcast the desktop. So if you have EyeTV maximized and Camtwist broadcasting the desktop and your flash broadcasted using camtwist as a source, you should be set! If you want audio, soundflower is good for that, but not quite as straightforward as Camtwist. Might have to play with it. But there are lots of good tutorials on this online, give it a google.

A: As far as I remember, HD PVR Capture can show a preview in VLC Player while recording. Did you look into the 'streaming and transcoding options' in VLC Player?
Maybe you will find a solution in the VLC forum. CamTwist is probably easier.
You can stream to Twitch with HDPVRCapture, OBS and SoundFlower
or ffmpeg.
