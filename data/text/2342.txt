Q: How to install and run nautilus using macports (or any other way) I've installed macports and then done 'sudo port install nautilus' to install nautilus, which all works fine. Now i'm not sure how to actually run nautilus - there's no app in the applications, and if i do 'nautilus' from the terminal it simply throws up a lot of errors.
Am i missing something?
Thanks
And the errors are below:
:~ $ nautilus

A: This problem sounds like you did not set up dbus yet. Read the output of the command port notes dbus and follow the instructions.
$ port notes dbus
dbus has the following notes:
