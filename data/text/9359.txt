Q: Is there an application for boosting the bass levels of all system audio? Is there any application to boost the bass levels in all audio output?
I started searching for it because I have a HTC Wildfire phone and loaded Cyanogenmod onto it. In that I have got an application named "DSP Manager" which can dramatically increase bass levels.
I thought it would be very nice if I could get something similar for my MacBook Pro.

A: BOOM!
It's a very simple app, costs just $9 on the Mac App Store as of this writing.
We covered this app on the Ask Different Podcast, episode 15. Nathan needed an app to apply a satisfactory EQ output to all system audio, as he's begun to use Spotify more often than iTunes, and Spotify does not have an EQ function built in.
Thus, we have BOOM! A variety of uses (gain/leveling, EQing, etc.), with a simple interface, and a low cost.

A: I only know of iWOW, which is pretty decent.

A: 
I didn't want to pay to have an equalizer so I developed my own one and giving it away for free! Click here to download eqMac! The app is signed by Apple and works for OSX 10.9 and higher!

A: Hear is one solution. It is commercial, but a time-restricted demo is available for free. It also works with other apps besides iTunes.
