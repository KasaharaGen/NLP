Q: Can I upgrade to the Lion Mail app alone, without upgrading to Lion in general? I'm currently on 10.6 and I really like it so I'm not really thinking about an upgrade right now. Two things I really like about 10.7 are the full screen apps and the Mail client.
Is it possible to somehow upgrade/purchase the Mail client of 10.7 alone? It would be really nice if I could do that.

A: These apps (and the full screen mode) require APIs that are not available on versions prior to Lion. Even if one could purchase Mail separately, it wouldn't run.

A: It's not possible, unfortunately, and copying and pasting it won't work either. (FaceTime cannot be copied from 10.7 to 10.6 also.)

A: Consider Postoffice mail app; it's got a lot to offer if you can't upgrade to lion.
