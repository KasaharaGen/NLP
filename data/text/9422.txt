Q: Does the 2011 Mac Mini work with dual monitors? I want to start development on Mac, and from what I read around, everyone suggests the current Mac Mini. So my question is, does the hardware support dual monitors out of the box? 
If not, what should I purchase to get a dual monitor setup working? 

A: Yes, I too am a developer using a mid-2011 Mac Mini (with AMD Radeon GPU) connected to two Samsung displays 


*

*one display connected using HDMI cable which comes with the Mac Mini, and

*another display connected using an Apple DisplayPort to VGA cable which I
had to buy separately.

Extended desktop and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports up to 1920 by 1200 pixels on a DVI or VGA display; up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on a dual-link DVI display using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter (sold separately)


A: Yes - search for the term "two displays" at the marketing page for the Mac Mini.
