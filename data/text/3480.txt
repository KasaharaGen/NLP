Q: How do I play a YouTube video in the background on my iPad? I like to 'listen' to YouTube video in the background while I am surfing on my desktop. However, I cannot do this on the iPad as, as soon as I switch from YouTube video to the browser, the video pauses. Is there a solution for this either in the form of an app or a website?

A: Play the video on youtube. Hit home button to exit, lock the screen, hit home button again 2 times, the current playing track will be displayed at the top of screen with play button under it. tap that and voila. (works with iOS 5)

A: Try the following steps :
1: Start the video from YouTube whilst in Safari.
2: Hit Home key once. You'll exit Safari and playback will stop.
3: Double-tap Home key to bring up the app-switcher. Slide to the right to bring up background audio controls. The icon on the right side will show whichever program you last used with background audio: Safari.
4: Press Play. Youtube audio will resume playback.

A: It looks like google is hunting down and killing all apps with threats and API terms changes to make it impossible to write an app that does. Ore than safari can do for YouTube.

I am and was a satisfied user of protube and have deep respect for how the author tried to not take away features from past paid users of the app. 
I donâ€™t use google's app either, but that might be the only solution for people going forward.

*Play a youtube video

*Press home button -> video/audio stops

*Press home button twice to bring the multi task bar

*Click play button and enjoy the music... :)


A: One simple solution that I use is to simply convert and download the video to an mp3. Then you can save it and play it back anytime. There is a great new tool that will let you convert and download YouTube videos right from your browser. This is free although you will need to create an account and login to use it.
