Q: NTFS mount issue in Lion I am getting this error. Can anybody help me?
/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/fusefs.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) requested architecture/executable not found;

A: You probably need to upgrade to a new version of MacFuse. Unfortunately there isn't one available. See this blog post. So there is a new project called OSXFuse which is going to support this. Here is the link to the Github project. https://github.com/osxfuse
I hope this helps a little.

A: Check Fuse4X project, it should help you. Here is another lengthy article about current state of NTFS on OSX.
