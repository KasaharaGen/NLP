Q: How do I make my iOS devices use British/Australian/Commonwealth spelling? I have the keyboard set to "British" and my locale is Australia, but neither of these seem to affect the spelling suggestions.

A: Spelling is determined by the keyboard setting you're using. Go to Settings > General > International > Keyboards, and make sure that English (UK) is added. It also helps to remove the US keyboard so that you don't accidentally get stuck in that.
