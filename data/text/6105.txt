Q: Apple Wireless Might Mouse keeps disconnecting? I have an Apple Wireless Mighty Mouse (not the newer Magic Mouse) that I've used for a couple of years.
In recent months, though, the mouse would spontaneously disconnection itself at random, even when the batteries are still full.
Does anyone have experience with this or know how to fix it?
I am running Mac OS X 10.6.8 if that makes a difference.
Thanks!

A: Try completely disconnecting the mouse from your computer, then re-pairing the mouse with the computer. I don't know if that'll help, but it's worth a try.
