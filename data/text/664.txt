Q: Spelling correction on iPod Touch How do I keep iOS from replacing my typing with something else when a correction is proposed? If I do nothing (i.e., don't choose the proposed word) and continue typing, it replaces the word I typed!
Is this possible to have the opposite behaviour—that is, to have to do something to have what I typed modified?

A: Take a look at Apple's iPod touch iOS4 User Guide. In particular, page 31 has two helpful tips:


*

*To reject the suggested word, finish typing the word as you want it, then tap the “x” to dismiss the suggestion before typing anything else. Each time you reject a suggestion for the same word, iPod touch becomes more likely to accept your word.


*Turn auto-correction and spell checking on or off: Choose General > Keyboard, then turn Auto-Correction on or off. Auto-Correction is on by default.
