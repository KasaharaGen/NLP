Q: How to change the ad-hoc WiFi name in OSX? When I turn on Internet Sharing on my mac, the broadcasted network name is the original Computer Name of the iMac.
The computer name has since been changed, however the WiFi name continues to be broadcast as the original which I really need to change. I've looked everywhere in System Preferences for the original computer name but can't find any remnant of it.  
Can anyone please tell me how to change the ad-hoc WiFi name?

A: In Lion and Snow Leopard, you can create a network from the AirPort menu and choose whatever SSID you please.

The same dialog should be available from the network preference pane in System Preferences if you prefer that avenue.
