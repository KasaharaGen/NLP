Q: Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad on Windows-7 I am using Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad on Windows 7 and its numeric pad is not working on windows 7, it was working OK on windows XP, what I can do to make it work on it too?

A: Hah! I actually use a mac keyboard as the normal keyboard on my windows boxes. I like the laptop-feel and the aluminium.
This is easy to fix. 
Push "Clear".
The "Clear" key on the numberpad gets mapped to the "NumLock" key on windows.
If you want to fix the swapping of the alt and "Command" keys, KeyTweak works well.
It can also let you set the additional F-keys (e.g. F13-F19, which are not real F-keys) to be  whatever you want. I have them mapped as media keys (next-track, pause, etc...)

A: Press and hold "clear" key for three seconds. It will work as NUMLOCK in windows. You can shift to numerics and the "<-- -->" kind of finctions.
Hope it will help.

A: Took me a while to figure out the "Clear" key (which acts as NumLock on long-press, in Windows) is the square with the "x" inside, on the upper left corner of the numpad, on my Apple keyboard.
