Q: Where do terminated incomplete downloads go when using firefox? Where do terminated incomplete downloads go when using firefox?

A: They should stay in the designated folder. Mine is /Downloads, and they can have either the filename.part or some weird name.part. Either way, they should be in your downloads or designated folder. If you cannot find it, right click and do show in finder, and it will open the folder containing it.

A: To the "great bit-bucket in the sky".  Whenever I cancel a download with Firefox, it cleans up after itself.  Leaving partial downloads around is abnormal, e.g., if I crashed or killed Firefox during the download.
