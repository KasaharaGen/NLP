Q: Can I change my 2011 iMac's graphic card from AMD's to nvidia Quadro? I do lot of video editing work, mostly on FCP & Avid and I feel Quadro card is way to go.
Do you think I can get it changed from Apple?

A: I don't even think the hardware would be compatible. Quite frankly, while you can open up the system and tinker with it, you have to worry about two things:


*

*Form factor - The card is probably a different shape. Apple partners with other companies when designing a system and the fact that they put an ATI in there says something about the engineering of the machine.

*Power & bus interface - These are likely less of an issue, but something to be aware of.


The iMac is a turnkey system, not an upgradable machine, like the Mac Pro (or, gasp, a PC). I'm sorry that this is not the answer you want to hear, but I don't think that Apple will do it. That said, it can't hurt to ask.

A: Some cards can be made to work in OS X with custom ROM, however, OS X extensions do not support the card's hardwired device ID, so it would result in a Kernel Panic at boot. If the card is close to another officially supported card in OS X or use the same GPU, there's an easy hack which will allow it to operate in OS X.
NVIDIA Quadro 4
This card is very close to GeForce 4 Ti series, using same GPU and PCB layout. Some even have dual DVI outputs.
Custom GeForce 4 Ti ROM will make the card work as a Mac Card, but a Kernel Panic will happen every time you try to boot with original NVIDIA extensions.
To begin you'll need to:


*

*find the hardware Device ID of your card

*have your card flashed and working with a Mac ROM, you can test your card in OS 9 (currently available ROM for Quadro 4 700 XGL)

*have an editor capable of modifying plist files.


For the Quadro 4 700 XGL


*

*Device ID of the card is 025B (Quadro 4 700 XGL) 10DE (NVIDIA)

*ROM is available online

*Quadro 4 / GeForce 4 Ti series will use 2 OS X extensions to operate.  First is NVDAResman.kext (used by every NVIDIA card), second is NVDANV20Hal.kext (specific kernel extension for GeForce 4 series / NV2x GPUs)



Before physically installing your Mac flashed card, let's proceed with the Extensions hack.


*

*Go to your root disk (OS X installation) and go to folder /System/Library/Extensions

*Back up the extensions you're going to modify (here NVDAResman.kext and NVDANV20Hal.kext). Keep one copy of each in a safe place, and one copy of each in your desktop. Last 2 copies are going to be edited.

*Right-Click on the first extension you copied on your desktop and use "show package content" option. The extension will open as a classic folder.

*Open the "Contents" folder and Open the file Info.plist with your editor.

*Search for string IOPCIMatch and add your card's device ID.  Save the file and proceed to do the same with the second extension.





*Copy the edited extensions packages to /System/Library/Extensions

*Open the Disk Utility application and run the repair permissions utility on your drive.

*Now install the card, and reboot your computer.
