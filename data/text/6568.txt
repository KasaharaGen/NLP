Q: How to force iOS apps to use global proxy settings Most stock apps will use the proxy settings, but apps from the App Store rarely use the proxy settings given under Settings > Wifi. I am told that the proxy API must be called explicitly, but is there a way, perhaps a jailbreak app, that will force all connections to go through the proxy? I currently have the option of using either a .PAC config file or typing out the http proxy of my university manually and providing authentication details.

A: I was able to proxy URL requests from 4 apps I just tested (Instagram, App Store, Omni Focus, Bookmarks). I used a manual proxy configuration and Charles to test.
I'm not sure what proxy API you're talking about. From personal experience, I know that any app using an NSURLConnection to make the request will go through the proxy as defined by the system. It's possible some apps use a socket directly to make the request - if so that may bypass the system's proxy settings, but I'm not sure about that.
