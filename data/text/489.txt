Q: Can you sync computer with iPhone? When having one computer, it works great syncing your iphone with it, to get your stuff on the iPhone. However, having two computers, one at work and one at home, I wonder if it's possible to have a relationship like this:
 Computer 1 > iPhone > Computer 2

instead of the two computers battling against each other and removing files etc they don't have? It would be great if you could do this automatically, so I don't have to manually transfer files etc.

A: I found an article on Lifehacker about this issue: How to sync an iPhone with two (or more) Computers.

Plug your iPhone into a variety of
  computers, yours or other people's,
  and you'll find that your phone and
  iTunes want to wipe everything clean
  and start over, every single time.
  Andrew Grant at the Shiny Things blog
  shows how to edit your iTunes Music
  Library XML file to sync your phone
  (or iPod touch) with different
  systems. That means you can, say,
  auto-grab just your music from your
  Mac at home, but grab Contacts and
  Calendars from your work PC. The guide
  requires very little hacking, and
  Grant provides links to simple text
  and hex editors to get the job done.


A: If you use Macs, MobileMe makes this pretty easy (although it is not cheap).  I have my iPhone, iPad, and three Macs synched this way.
MobileMe sorta works with Windows too, but I don't have enough experience to recommend it.
