Q: iPhone app submission process I've submitted my first app on the 20th November but the status is still "Waiting for review", has anyone had longer than this or similar waiting times?

A: The approval process varies and there’s no exact number. The factor that determines this is the number of apps in the approval queue. I don’t remember where I read that 95% of the apps where approved within 14 days. I believe this came in a “message” in the dev accounts. But it was more than a year ago. 
You can see more information in your Developer Account by going to the approval page. (You need a paid account to access that).
I haven’t submitted an iPhone App but in my near experience, it’s around two weeks.

A: I waited for 8 days with my first iPhone app. It was incredibly fast IMO. I guess the approval times depends on the type of app you are making and how well your app is put together.
