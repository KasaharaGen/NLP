Q: Mac Dictionary improvements I tend to use the dictionary a lot on the mac. Its annoying to launch the app everytime i need to lookup a word. Are there any other apps/hacks to avoid this annoyance? Spotlight lookup is awesome, but doesnt show enough detail. Do you know any app that can provide a panel view for dictionary definitions. For example, launch bar has a nice panel view for its calculator results. 

A: Try ^+âŒ˜+D while selecting a word (that's ctrl+cmd+d). If the app is well integrated into Mac OS X, it will show a little popup with the word definition.
Like so

If you click "More..", it'll open the dictionary app.
If this shortcut doesn't work, go to 
System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard shortcuts > Services
and search Look Up in Dictionary to add the shortcut you want.

A: You can use Alfred which, with the define keyword (configurable), will give you several answers with the first line of the definition. It's as fast as Spotlight (I replaced Spotlight by Alfred) and is much more convenient, complete and easy to use. I'm just delighted. I now use the dictionary a lot while I didn't before for the same reason you're giving.
Here's an example:


A: 
"Can i have a dictionary panel instead
  of launching the whole app?"

In Dictionary.app, open the Preferences panel and change the Contextual menu setting from Opens Dictionary application to Opens Dictionary panel:

This will open up the small panel which stays within the same application (like Loic Wolff showed in the image).
