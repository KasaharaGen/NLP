Q: CMD 2 keyboard shortcut no longer working Since Wednesday I can no longer use ⌘2 as shortcut in any application on my MacBook Pro. I've quadruple checked Keyboard Shortcuts in Settings and I have nothing there. ⌘ and any other key works fine.
Today I discovered that with an external keyboard attached, I can use ⌘2 by using the 2 key on the number pad, but not the 2 in the number row.  
Ideas?

A: One common cause of a single key combo not working is that it gets set as the trigger for Text to speech or for Speech Recognition.  Double check system preferences/speech

A: Log out, and then log in while holding down the shift key to keep any apps from launching, and see if that helps.
Or enable the Guest Account, log in there, and see if it still happens.
Not sure what might have happened, but this might at least help you rule out a few more possibilities.
