Q: What's a good Picasa upload app for iPhone? Android has "Instant Upload" with the Google+ app. I'd like something similar for iPhone: an app that takes all my photos and uploads them to a private album on Picasa Web Albums. Jailbreak alternatives are fine too.
Searching the App Store for the word "picasa" gives me far too many results. There are some Picasa album-browsing apps, and a few uploading tools (mostly paid; free versions only upload thumbnails). Rather than testing out all 59+ apps myself, perhaps some fellow users here have personal experiences and recommendations?
I'm using Linux on my pc. This means that iTunes is not an option. (Yes, it's a hassle...) I am looking for something that can upload straight from iPhone to web, without requiring a computer as a middle step. 
Bonus points for operation in the background, but I'll accept an app that requires to be foreground -- as long as it can upload.

A: I use Web Albums and it works well. It's currently $2.99 on the US store.

A: Seems like the new answer is the Google+ app for iOS.

A: Photoforge2 is an excellent photo editing app for both iPhone and iPad that uploads to Picasa and just about everything else. It's a real bargain too: Â£0.69 in the UK/$0.99 in the US.
There are plenty of other options too: see my round up of iPad photo apps over on photo.stackexchange.com.

A: I used PhotoSync (US$1.99) and was impressed by its features. You can not only upload to Picasa but also Flickr, Dropbox and other services, including to your computer or another iphone/iPad.
