Q: Why does the iTunes artist list jump to start when I scroll it? I updated my iTunes yesterday, along with Lion, as did a lot of other people. Now I've been experiencing some weird behaviour.

I have my iTunes setup like above. I usually browse to artist by typing the first few letters of their name, and the list jumps down to the results. It still does that. However, when I scroll the list afterwards it jumps to the very top of the list, regardless of scroll direction.
Have anyone experience similar problems? And if so, how have you solved it?
Edit: Problem has been solved in the new iTunes 10.5.1

A: It's probably scrolling to where the cursor is, and since you searched, the cursor has been reset and moved to the top of the list.  Click once in the list to select a visible item, then scroll.
