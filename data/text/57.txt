Q: Is there a free, lightweight text editor that isn't text-only but also isn't a heavyweight IDE? I'm not really satisfied with the text-editors available for Mac OS X.
I tried TextWrangler, Smultron, Coda, SubEthaEdit, TextMate and others I do not remember. But none of the above satisfied my needs.
I want a (free) text editor

In plain English: the perfect lightweight text editor which is not yet a heavyweight IDE.

A: Try Editra It's do lots of you want but not all of them, it's similar to notepad++ in windows.

A: I can't vouch for it personally, but RedCar looks pretty promising. It supports TextMate bundles and runs on Mac, Linux & Windows. It doesn't support your entire feature list, I don't believe it has integrated source-control or project support (other than folders).


A: You need Notepad++ running under wine! or winebottler!

A: One trend I noticed this year is Mac programmers and web developers moving away from Textmate and the like to MacVim, including Ryan Singer of 37signals, who rocked MacVim during his Future of Web Applications talk recently.
Lots of people have written about why they switched; "Coming Home to Vim" is my favorite. 

A: What's wrong with BBEdit, other than you might have to pay for it?

A: You might try KomodoEdit.

Reasonably fast

*which does syntax highlighting
  

Check

There are lots of plugins; I'm sure it is possible to create your own syntax highlighter

  
*
  
*where the developers are active,
  

I believe so.

  
*
  
*which does not have the look & feeling of TextWrangler (I hate the sliding sidebar) but or a real Mac-application
  

I'm afraid it is not a Cocoa application; it is built off of Firefox's UI system.

  
*
  
*which can define projects (like Coda can)
  

Yep.

  
*
  
*which includes a basic support for Git and/or SVN
  

It looks like there may be some built-in Git support.  Here's a git plugin.
It looks like support for SVN is built-in.
Edit: Those features appear to require Komodo IDE, instead of Komodo Edit.  Komodo IDE is a for-pay upgrade.  You might find "Home-baked SVN support for Komodo Edit" to be interesting.

  
*
  
*which supports a fast autocompletion
  

It has autocompletion; you'll have to try it to see if it is fast enough for you.

  
*
  
*Mac OS X 10.6 compatible
  

Yes.

A: There is a new editor on the block called Chocolat. I've been using it for a week now and really like it. It has a lot of the features of TextMate (as well as supporting TextMate bundles) but I've found it to work a lot better with large sets of files especially over the network.

A: I'm partial to Coda these days, but came across this the other day when I was looking for something else.  I haven't tried it, so not sure if it meets all your needs. It's free, but only because it's not being developed anymore.

A: There's a new text editor called Kod that is modern, fast, and support projects. 
A warning -- development on Kod is just starting, so things are a bit unstable. It's alpha-level software at version 0.0.3, although I think it will eventually turn into just the application you're looking for.
Features:


*

*Written from the ground up for 10.6 using Grand Central Dispatch and other new things

*Uses GNU Syntax Highlighting format so there's highlighting support for every language

*Modern UI with Chromium tabs

*Scriptable using node.js


A: Atom by GitHub is a free and powerful text editor and IDE build with programmers in mind. At the same time, it also doesn't give the impression of being a heavy-weight IDE.
Visual Studio Code is another similar offering from Microsoft.

A: Have you considered Xcode?
I know you said you don't like TextMate, but it's one that meet pretty much all your needs.

which is fast  

TextMate
Really fast    
Xcode
Not that fast but not Eclipse/Netbeans-slow

which does syntax highlighting

TextMate
Very complete and extensible  
Xcode
Does syntax highlighting, it depends on your needs  

were I can define own syntaxes (or there are many plugins e.g. for YAML),

TextMate
Very, very extensible  
Xcode
Syntax extensions are possible 

where the developers are active,  

TextMate
Some say it's vaporware, yet very few other text editor can compete with its current features
Xcode
Apple development of this program is very active

which does not have the look & feeling of TextWrangler  

TextMate
If you don't like the sliding bar, there's a plugin to replace it by a drawer
Xcode
Doesn't have a sliding bar  

which can define projects (like Coda can)  

TextMate  / Xcode
Do projects

which includes a basic support for Git and/or SVN  

TextMate
Support for Git/SVN/Mercurial (and probaby more) via built-in and added plugins
Xcode
SVN support for 3.x, added Git in Xcode 4

which supports a fast autocompletion  

TextMate
Basic variable/function completion
very complete code completion via bundles  
Xcode
Basic variable/function completion

MacOS X 10.6 compatible  

TextMate
Some compatibility issue
Xcode
Fully compatible

A: Have you tried any of the Eclipse variants? I'm not a huge Eclipse fan, but the Aptana version of Eclipse (which is geared primarily towards front-end web developers) seems to satisfy all of your requirements above and may be worth a peek.

A: Your best bet in 2018 for free and active and extensible editors that are not heavy IDE are:


*

*https://code.visualstudio.com/

*http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/

*https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
All are very fast on SSD modern Mac, even the MacBook (One) with a mobile CPU with minimum cores and clock rate. All are free, actively developed, extensible, support code control and completion and are extensible, scriptable and can be added to for many languages and syntax. 

A: There is also Brackets, to consider. Written in Javascript, currently developed by Adobe as a "community guided, open source project", focuses on web development but can also be used as a generic text editor, has a solid API to extend it and a growing number of extension already available.

A: I would say that MacVim but it's of course a more complicated tool based on the traditional unix vim text-editor with a steep learning curve.
By the way, which aspect of TextMate didn't appeal you?

A: Sublime Text 2
Support for TextMate snippets, languages and color schemes.
Split view, tabbing, projects, commands. Full-screen on Lion and a "focused" mode.
Extensible, too.
Very fast, great multiple selection mode and cross-platform.
Currently priced at $59, but a free version is available with occasional alerts.
It also has a rapidly-growing plugin API and surrounding community.

Check it out, it's freaking awesome.
Update: Sublime Text 2 is now superseded by Sublime Text 3 which features various enhancement and performance improvements.

A: I think that Aquamacs might do the trick!

A: You're not going to find it.

*which is fast,
  

TexMate is pretty fast. TextWrangler is faster for large files though.

  
*
  
*which does syntax highlighting
  

Most (if not all) have syntax highlighting.

  
*
  
*were I can define own syntaxes (or there are many plugins e.g. for YAML),
  

You might or might not get this.

  
*
  
*where the developers are active,
  

Best of luck with that.

  
*
  
*which does not have the look & feeling of TextWrangler (I hate the sliding sidebar) but or a real Mac-application
  

What's wrong with the sidebar? 

  
*
  
*which can define projects (like Coda can)
  

Define projects as folders and you're all set.

  
*
  
*which includes a basic support for Git and/or SVN
  

UNIX philosophy is to do one thing and do it well. Integrated support for an SCM is not something easily found. Perhaps you should use an external tool?

  
*
  
*which supports a fast autocompletion
  

As far as I know, only a few major IDE's support this. 
You're not going to find what you're looking for free. Any IDE will feel slow as mud compared to a text editor like TM or TW. 
If you want my honest opinion, try TextMate. Bundles will allow you to replicate some of the behavior you're looking for, the rest you can hope is in 2.0. 

A: Check out Fraise, the successor to Smultron.  It meets many of your requirements.  Here are the ones that are not met:

*

*where the developers are active: Fraise looks like it's now dying like its predecessor

*which includes a basic support for Git and/or SVN: not sure what you mean by this, but Fraise has command line integration

*which supports a fast autocompletion: not positive but I don't think it has autocompletion... but it has commands and text snippets

Everything else you mention is in there.
on edit:
I was a notepad++ guy for years doing windows dev work and over the last couple months I've slowly transitioned over to vim.  It does every single thing you're asking for and more.
