I downloaded the file and extracted it but there isn't a single runnable file at all?
Does anyone know how do I start using it (get it running?).
Ps: I'm using Windows Vista, would this be a problem?

A: The application you point out is a Mac only application. That's why it doesn't work on Windows Vista.
However, here's two alternatives :


*

*iPhone backup extractor which is a paid multiplatform app

*iphonebackupbrowser which is less polished and windows only, but free.


You may as well be interested by PhoneDisk which allow to browse any connected iOS device without jailbreaking them. It does the job and works on Mac OS & Windows. It's a shareware, but the demo is fully usable.
