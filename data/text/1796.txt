Q: Disable “not ejected properly” warning (as only charging and not writing data)

Disable “the disk was not ejected properly” message 

Per this blog post (not my blog post) how would you go about disabling the warning popup given that I know I'm not writing data so can't suffer any data loss?
I'd be satisfied with an answer that just disabled this warning across the board, but a more specific solution that could blacklist specific devices, or even better a "smart" way of only showing the popup if data has been written.
