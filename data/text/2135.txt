Q: How to increase size of the Spotlight search results window? Is it possible to increase window width of the Spotlight search results under Mac OS X 10.6.6? I mean the semi-transparent "instant search result" window appearing at the top right corner under magnifying glass, not the Finder window.
The standard window is too narrow: longer file names or Dictionary word translations just don't fit there. Why not using more screen space for the search result?

A: Have you looked at using 'Alfred' as search tool - It's free on the App Store and very flexible, and has a wider results view. If you try it, take a little time to get familiar with the options - I find it a fantastic time saver.

A: There are hacks for the resultant Finder window but nothing for the actual results pane dropdown

A: I am not sure this answers to the question (and moreover I am using 10.5), but you already know that if you hover over a result for a couple of seconds, it shows the complete file name and path, don't you?

A: I would suggest using Quicksilver. Note that it is still in beta, but it is a pretty stable beta. It is a little complicated to use, but it is more that just a replacement for Spotlight. It has smart capabilities, so it remembers what you typed recently. For me, I use Chrome a lot, so when I type "C" it automatically knows that I want Chrome. It also does provide dictionary results from dict.org and it displays them in a way that you can see them. Let me know if you do use this as it can be confusing for new users.
