Q: Are there any native tools for SVG conversion on OS X? How can I convert SVG image to something raster? Are there any native [command-line] tools on OS X that can do that? I am able to open them in Safari or Firefox, but doing "Save as..." only proposes original (.svg) or web-archive formats and no rasterized image format.

A: You can do this with Inkscape:
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/script --without-gui --export-png=raster-image.png  source-image.svg

To change output resolution you can set the DPI value:
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/script --without-gui --export-png=raster-image.png --export-dpi=200  source-image.svg

Here are more command line options.

A: https://cloudconvert.org/svg-to-png - was fastest way for me.
it's not my site.

A: One (wonky) option would be to render it in Safari and take a screenshot of the result, although that's obviously not a good solution.
Sadly there's little SVG support in OS X so far apart from Safari, Preview.app (the obvious choice for image format conversion) can't render it and I'm not aware of any bundled command line tools that can either.
As for third party command line tools, Homebrew makes Cairo's svg2png as well as the ImageMagick bundle easily available.

A: Try Gapplin. It works for me and creates PNG and JPG files from SVG. Simple and effective.
If you have a lot of SVG files to convert, ImageMagick is probably your best bet (available directly from imagemagick.org or via Homebrew).
