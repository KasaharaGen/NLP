Q: Where do you get games for the click wheel iPods? I've got an iPod classic, and I can't for the life of me find any of the games that work with it on the iTunes Store.
I know they are there, because I've seen them recently I just can't find them.

A: Open the iTunes store, click the triangle at the end of the App Store tab at the top, and choose iPod Click Wheel Games at the very bottom.
