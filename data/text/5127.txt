Q: How do you access a subdomain on localhost with VMWare Fusion on a Mac? I am able to access localhost on a Mac through Windows XP on VMWare Fusion by using my Mac username like this:
http://username.local:3000/

But how do I do that with a subdomain, something like this:
http://username.subdomain.local:3000/

Any ideas?
I am able to access subdomains on my Mac no problem, by adding things like blog.localhost to /etc/hosts.  What is the equivalent on Windows?

A: Navigate to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc where the 'hosts' file is located.
