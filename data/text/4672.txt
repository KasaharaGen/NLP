Q: Microsoft Word right-to-left (RTL) support I have on my Mac - Microsoft Word 2010, now â€¦ I want to write from right to left ( not only text-align right, but direction ltr).
I'll be thankful for some help. :)

A: Word 2016 has this language feature if you can upgrade Word. 
There's no right-to-left support for Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac presently. There are several alternative word processors that do support RTL, however:


*

*OpenOffice

*Mellel

*Nisus Writer Pro

A: After endless effort to find a solution the only thing that worked for me was opening another document that was already saved with a paragraph direction from right to left. Worked like a charm!

A: Nevron Writer for MAC has RTL support though its not perfect - https://www.nevronoffice.com/
