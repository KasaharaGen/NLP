Q: Apple Detecting Jailbreak on a NOT jailbroken iPhone I recently received a notification that took up the whole screen on my iphone which says that I have breached the Apple terms and conditions for jailbreaking my iphone.
However, I am pretty sure that I haven't done any jail breaking to it and it is a definitely a new piece of hardware since I bought it directly from the telco with the box and wraps.
What could be the reason for this happening and what should I do? It has been working fine for a year or so, till this message pop up recently.

A: That notification could have come from any app.  Check under your settings which apps you have got that you allow notifications from.  I am not aware of any official method for Apple to send these out, and unless there was some sort of corrective action or advice attached I can't see the point in you receiving it either.  This is almost impossible to provide a real answer to, but my first thoughts are either a prank or compromised notification through one of your existing apps.
If you receive it again, take a screen shot - hold down your home button, then tap the power button - the screen will flash white and the picture will appear in your camera roll.

A: If it took the whole screen, then it can't be a push notification like stuffe suggests.
But it's something your network provider can do. I've seen it on my iPhone, too. It wasn't about jailbreaking, just some (very intrusive) ads. But it was fullscreen and I couldn't do anything before I clicked on it.
It's probably an error from your provider, so you may want to check with them.
