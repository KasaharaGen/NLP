Q: How do I publish a link to my iChat account So I have an email signature and web site that links to my email, twitter and linkedin identities, how do I add a link to my iChat account (via google talk server) other than just linking to my google user name (which is of course my gmail address). Thanks.
RIP Steve Jobs.

A: I believe that these work:
<a href="aim:goim?screenname=dori">AIM</a> 
<a href="ymsgr:sendIM?dori">YIM</a> 
<a href="gtalk:chat?jid=dori">gTalk</a> 
<a href="skype:dori?chat">Skype</a>

Or would, if I had the user account dori on any of those services.
