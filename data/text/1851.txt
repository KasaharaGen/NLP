Q: Convert from OpenOffice to Pages Does anybody has experience in how to best convert OpenOffice.org documents to pages documents.
Obviously, it can be read in a Text Editor.

A: The way I do it is I export the OpenOffice document to Microsoft Word DOC format, then use Pages to convert that into a Pages document. There may be some formatting loss, but I'm not aware of a way to convert directly from one format to the other.

A: I would suggest saving in RTF format instead of Word format as OS X has a very competent RFT engine as used by TextEdit and, I would guess, Pages. This avoids the conversion in and out of a poorly defined format with no public specification.
