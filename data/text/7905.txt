Q: How can I stop fseventsd for certain volumes? I also have a partion with Ubuntu installed. Unfortunately, every time I have an error while working on the Ubuntu partion (I believe it's ext3), I get a Kernel Panic and I have to restart. I believe this is related to fseventsd, since it my try to log the errors on the root of the Ubuntu partition.
How can I stop fseventsd logging events on that Ubuntu volume?
Thank you!

A: Preventing file system event storage
Whilst you should not stop the daemon, you can disable logging on a per-volume basis. 
In the Mac Developer Library
File System Events Programming Guide: File System Event Security: Preventing File System Event Storage advises: 

… To disable logging on a per-volume basis (for creating a backup
  volume, for example), you must do the following:
  
  
*
  
*Create a .fseventsd directory at the top level of the volume.
  
*Create an empty no_log file in that directory.
  
  
  So if your volume is mounted at /Volumes/MyDisk, you would create an
  empty file called /Volumes/MyDisk/.fseventsd/no_log.


Kernel panics
Please consider creating a separate question. 

A: OS X does not have a built-in ext3 driver so it's not possible to even access the Ubuntu partition from OS X.
There is a lot of information missing here making it impossible to correctly assess what is causing your kernel panic.
Are you even using Apple hardware?
