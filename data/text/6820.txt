Q: importing pictures from iphone to PC Does anyone know anyway to make the iTunes sync photos taken using camera on my phone  into my PC?
I've enabled the iTunes photo sync already but it isn't working.
Right now I'm accessing the photos in the My Computer and right click Import Pictures (or Explore) .
