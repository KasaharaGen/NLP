Q: Contact's numbers not formatted correctly on my Verizon iPhone 4S I setup my Verizon iPhone 4S by restoring from a backup of my 3GS.
Now my contact's phone numbers aren't formatted at all. They now look like 5555551234 whereas they used to be formatted like (555) 555-1234.
In the Messages app, most conversations are no longer linked to a contact's name, only phone numbers are shown.
Creating a new contact exhibits the same problem.
Adding +1 to the beginning of each contact's phone number(s) seems to help, but I'd rather not have to manually edit all of my contacts.

A: My Verizon iPhone 4S appears to have been in some sort of international mode by default.
The fix is to 'Program' the phone via Verizon's system:


*

*Open Phone and dial *228. This is the Verizon over-the-air
programming number.

*When the system answers, press 1 for "Program or activate your phone"

*Wait through the music for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, "Service Update Complete"

*Open the Task Manager and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications

*Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe)

*Open the Message App to verify the fix.

Edit: I had to do this again on December 2nd (perhaps because my carrier profile was updated?).
