Q: Apple's AirPort App Apple just released an app that helps you configure your apple router. I downloaded it to try it out and when I opened my iPad's Apps tab in iTunes I noticed you can transfer documents to this app. I would like to know what kind of documents can you transfer and for what purpose?

A: Backups of your current setup and config, and restores of same.
