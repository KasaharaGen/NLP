Q: How to get MacVim to autoload ~/.vim/syntax This might be something quirky about MacVim, so I'll ask here.
I put a syntax file in ~/.vim/syntax, but it doesn't load. I have syntax on in my .vimrc.
When I open the editor, :scriptnames doesn't include the syntax file. 
Is there anything else I need to do to make sure it loads?

A: In addition to relying on the detected filetype, which may be incorrect, there are at least two alternative ways to force loading of a particular syntax file.

*Manually run the command :set ft=lesscss

*Add the previous setting to a modeline near the beginning or ending of the file.  See :help modeline.

A: Figured it out. It seems like files in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax are loaded based on the detected filetype when the actual file is loaded.

So I just renamed the file to the detected filetype, lesscss, and it loaded fine.
