Q: How to share files with coworkers via internet? Securely? I have number of co-workers in other countries. I would like to be able to setup something like shared network drive so that we can all access the files and work together. What's the best way of doing that? Do I need Lion server for that?

A: Why not use something like Dropbox?
There's also Sparkleshare which allows you to host files yourself.

A: OwnCloud lets you setup your own cloud server environment.
