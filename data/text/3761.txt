Q: If I activate expose, then spaces, can I force the window arrangement to stay the same in both views? This is on OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard).
Let's say I activated Expose (All Windows), and I see my windows in a certain arragement. Then I activate Spaces. The spaces I was in sometimes shows the windows in a different arrangement from what I saw with Expose alone. Use case: I want to move an obscured window from one Space to another. The current behavior makes this more difficult to locate the window I had my eye on. I'd like to always have the same arrangement in both Expose-alone and Expose-plus-Spaces.
UPDATE:
I noticed that the z-order of windows in the Space affects whether the issue occurs; that makes it even more annoying.
UPDATE 2:
Also, I found a non-ideal workaround: using the shift-[shortcut key] to slowly activate Spaces so I can more readily see where my window is going. This doesn't solve my problem because I normally use a screen corner to activate Spaces. If someone can tell me how I can use screen-cornering with the slow Spaces activation, that would qualify as an answer too.
UPDATE 3:
Another trick I forgot about that makes the issue bearable: while Expos√© is active, pressing Option/Alt will display window titles - this works also if you activate Spaces while All Windows is active. That helps me locate the window faster.
Expose alone:

Expose plus Spaces (of the same windows as Expose alone):
