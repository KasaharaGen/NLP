Q: How Do You View Several PNG Images In Preview With Continuous Scroll? I have several PNG images I want to view as a single document in Preview, Lion OSX. 
Usually I just select several images and open them in Preview, but when I do that, I can't set the view to "Continuous Scroll."
The default behavior for PNG images in Preview seems to be to zoom out after you flip a page, meaning I have to resize every page scroll down. That gets tedious.
Is there a way to put these PNG images together in one, single Preview document so I can select "Continuous Scroll" as an option and don't have to resize each page?

A: Ok, here's what you need to do:  


*

*Open up the first PNG image in Preview. Make sure the side bar is showing.


*Open the second image in Preview, and from the sidebar, drag the thumbnail image from the second window to the first window's sidebar.


*Now, you'll notice that the title bar says "2 documents, 2 total pages." Continue dragging images into the first image until all the images are combined into one PNG. Make sure you save it. :-)  

A: You can drag PNG files as pages into a single PDF file. If you pick one of your PNGs in Preview and export it as a PDF, you can then drag the proxy icons of the others into the left-hand page preview bar and they will be (nondestructively -- the originals are preserved) added to that file. I don't know if that will make your previewing easier or not, but it's an option.

A: Ok, well this is way too obscure of an answer because a) it involves Terminal and b) it involves installing 3rd party software in Terminal.
If you install ImageMagick from the official site and then go into Terminal:

montage "$F1" "$F2" -tile 1x2 -geometry "${TARGET_WIDTH}x${TARGET_HEIGHT}+1+1" out.png

where F1 and F2 are files, and "TARGET_WIDTH" is the widest of the files.
The file "out.png" should be a combination of F1 and F2â€¦ you should be able to add more "F3" and other files.
