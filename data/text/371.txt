Q: Is there ANY way to edit, or at least view a MobileMe gallery on iPad? So I have a MobileMe account.  (Yes, I know that there are free alternatives; my wife hates change.)
So I post galleries of photos on MobileMe, and then from a computer I can either:


*

*Log in to my MobileMe account as the owner, where I can see my gallery, and edit it (delete photos, etc.)

*Go to the public, shared, gallery url, which allows me to view or download pics, but not edit the gallery, just like the folks I share the link with can.
But from my iPad, I can't really do either:


*

*If I try to go to login to MobileMe (at me.com), the MobileMe site sees that I'm on a mobile device, and won't open, routing me instead to the app store to get the mobileme gallery app, which is for the iphone, and scales pictures in a totally ridiculous way on the ipad.  There is no option to open the "normal" full website.

*If I try to go to the shared gallery url from my iPad, I can see the pics, but the thumbnails on the side use some kind of web tech that the iPad doesn't have, so I cant scroll.  I can only open the pics from the thumbnails that fit onto the ipad screen.  (Yes, I tried two finger scrolling.)
Any ideas?
