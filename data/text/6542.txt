Q: Macbook financing - resale I am potentially going to be buying a MacBook on finance from Apple. As it's my first Mac, I'm not 100% certain it'll be for me and so might re-sell it in the unlikely event it isn't.
If it isn't, am I able to just sell it on or is re-sale not allowed as long as I am still paying Apple? 
If I can, am I allowed to use the money I get from the re-sale to re-pay a larger amount off my finance agreement? (E.g., if my finance agreement is for £80 per month and I sell it for £1500, can I say to apple "instead of taking £80 this month take £1500 to pay more off", thus shortening the agreement?)
Edit
Just spoke to Apple, for anyone else searching for this answer you can pay the finance agreement off early if you do have the funds available.

A: I think once you finance it, it's yours and you are just paying off a loan to the finance company.  So long as you pay back your loan, the finance company won't care what you do with it.
I have no idea if the loan would be open or not, though; that's a very good question.
