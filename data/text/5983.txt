Q: Alternative to musikcube on Mac OS X Lion I like music to be played on the background and changing tracks by keyboard shortcut like in musikcube: http://www.musikcube.com/wiki/Preferences.
Is there an alternative for musikcube on Mac OS X Lion ?

A: SizzlingKeys may be of help here.

A: I use CoverSutra - not free, but pretty cheap, and I like the ability to have the album cover displayed on the desktop.
