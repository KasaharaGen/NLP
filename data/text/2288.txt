Q: Binding a keyboard shortcut to shut down I want to bind a gesture in BetterTouchTool to the shut down menu that is invoked by pressing the power button on my MacBook Air.
It's fairly simple to bind gestures to keyboard shortcuts, so what I'm really looking for is a way to bind a keyboard shortcut to the shut down menu. You can't use the power button in BetterTouchTool, so I need to bind it to a standard keyboard shortcut such as Command+Shift+S.

A: You don't need to map the power button, that menu is already mapped to control+eject

Other useful shutdown/restart/logoff key mappings are below which might be of interest too  
Prompt to save work and restart the Mac - Control+Command+Eject 
Prompt to save work and shutdown the Mac - Control+Option+Command+Eject 
Sleep - Command+Option+Eject 
Sleep displays - Shift+Control+Eject 
If the computer isn't responding and you need to force it to power off, you can hold down the power button for 6 seconds, you'll lose unsaved work though.  
These power shortcuts are listed on the apple support pages

A: Command Shift / will trigger the help menu. Press -> to get to the shutdown menu. Then you can scroll up to the shutdown option. Done.

A: While @Griffo's suggestion is useful, unfortunately the eject button cannot be used in BetterTouchTool.
In order to get it to work with BetterTouchTool, I did the following:


*

*Created a new shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts for All Applications with the menu title Shut Down... and I chose my own keyboard shortcut.

*I then bound a shortcut key in BetterTouchTool to this new keyboard shortcut.


It works as expected. The only drawback is that there are now two Shut Down options in the menu: Shut Down and Shut Down... It's a minor annoyance which I'm not sure how to fix.
