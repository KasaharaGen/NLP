Q: Is it possible to move all windows from one space to the other? Is there a way to move all the windows found in one space into another without having to move them one by one?
(This feature was available in Snow Leopard)

A: You can still do this in OS X Lion.
Move to the space you want to move the application's windows to. Right-click on the application icon in your Dock, select Options and enable "This Desktop" in the sub-menu. All of the windows should now move over to the current space.
Out of interest, how do you do this in Snow Leopard?
Edit: At last, I found a way to do this. Open Mission Control, and left-click and drag the application icon under the application windows to a new space at the top of the screen. You can create a new space entirely, or move all of the windows to an existing space. Hope this helps.

A: You can't at least for now, hope Apple adds more functionality to Mission Control. Although you can move all windows of a particular app between spaces....
