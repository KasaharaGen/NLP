Q: Filesorter alternative I found a really cool app in the App Store called FileSorter
It automatically sort files. Is there any FREE alternative?  

A: Actually, that application is free.

A: I've found this site a little while ago that let's me see if there are alternatives to apps either because they're on Windows (and the app's not important enough to boot Parallels) or too expensive:
alternativeto.net
Give that a try and see what you can find.
Specifically for you, this is what I found there.
