Q: USSD application for the iPad 2? Are there any applications that allow you to send USSD commands to your data service provider using the iPad 2?

A: There's an application called QueryUSSD available on Cydia for jailbroken phones. There's an article on iPhoneZA about how to use it and what kind of codes are available.
