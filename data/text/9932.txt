When opening a DMG file, how do I get it to open up in front of the windows? 

Whenever I open up a .dmg file, it just gets opened, but it stays under everything that I've got open.
Right now I would have to launch Mission Control to see the opened .dmg window and then click on it, to become visible at the top.
How can I set it up to behave in a way, that when I open up a .dmg file, it gets displayed on top of everything?

A: That's a Finder (on Lion) issue and as such, there are no settings to tweak for your problem. 
A faster way to reach the mount window is to simply click the Finder icon in your Dock.
