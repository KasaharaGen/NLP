Q: What's the best memory upgrade option for a mid2007 macbook running 10.6?

Yeah, I'm still trying to kick it old school.
I have a Macbook 2.1 (2.16 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB of Memory, 667 MHz Bus speed) that I recently installed 10.6 on (thanks to help from stack exchange). Unfortunately, between snow leopard and upgraded internet browser, I have about 20 MB of free memory just when checking my email. Lots of loading time and spinning wheel (aka Steve Jobs' eternal flame).
I've heard that since I have a dual core that I should always keep the two memory modules paired for best performance, which would make my best option two 1GB modules. But then I read on Crucial's website that the mid2007 macbook has a max of 3GB of memory, and that the an upaired set of 1GB and 2GB would be better than two 1 GB.
On a related note, will I notice a big difference with 3 GB vs. 2 GB of memory?
Thoughts? Answers?

A: You're not the first person to wonder about this. Yes, matched pairs are good for speed. More RAM is also good for speed. In my experience, and in what I've read, the speed boost from more RAM more than offset the penalty for mismatched pairs.
