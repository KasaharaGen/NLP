Q: How to check the location of installed files when using Installer on Mac 10.6.7 I am installing a C++ library using the Installer application(its a .mpkg file)  The installation is successful, but I cannot find the location of the library to set an environmental variable. I have checked the /private/var/log/install.log, but the destination folder is not listed.  Is there another log I can check, or a way to determine the installation destination through the .mpkg? 
Thank you very much for your time, 
Adam

A: Use pkgutil --pkg-info packageid and look for the listed "location" to see where the installation root was; then pkgutil --files packageid will show the installed files relative to that root location.

A: Simply open the package with the standard OS X Installer, and hit âŒ˜I (or through menus: File>Show files).
For more information or to act upon the files, use the excellent Pacifist package manager.

A: $ cd ~/Desktop/InsomniaT.mpkg/Contents/Resources/Kernel\ Module.pkg/Contents/
$ ls

A: You should be able to view the details of what was installed using pkgutil. 
You can use pkgutil --packages to get the exact name of the package and then pkgutil --files package to see what files were installed.
