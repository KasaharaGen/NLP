Q: Is there a sexier alternative to the status bar in Safari? I hate the status bar. However, I love hovering over URLs to find out where they will take me. Is there an alternative to having the status bar on at all times, or constantly toggling on/off? An extension, or maybe a preference that I'm missing?

A: I like the free UltimateStatusBar extension.
Visible only when you're hovering over a link, it shows where things lead, but does other stuff too. Like shortener expansion and favicon previews.
It's got lots of built-in themes you can use to customize the appearance.
