Q: Is there anywhere I can get a complete list of historical Safari release notes? I’ve done a bit of searching for specific Safari version numbers in support.apple.com. Quite a few versions have specific change notes, but it seems like often the versions bundled with major OS X releases aren’t given their own change notes.

Also, sometimes Apple’s release notes can be a bit... terse.
I’m trying to figure out which versions of Safari introduced support for HTML5/CSS features.
Wikipedia’s got a great table of releases, but it is a bit vague on CSS improvements (e.g. “improved CSS support”).

A: Safari uses Webkit as it's rendering engine. If you're specifically looking for when it began to support HTML5/CSS3, it as a fully open-source repository where you can review changes commit by commit. As such, you can see the full comprehensive, intricately detailed history here: http://trac.webkit.org/timeline

A: The Wapedia table you point to appears to just be a less clear version of the Safari version history page on Wikipedia.
This particular search on "When can I use…" appears to display much of what you're looking for.
This page at findmebyip.com also has a good breakdown, although it's not as specific about particular browser versions.
