Q: Playing music from the iPhone wirelessly to a stereo that doesn't support Bluetooth I'm looking for a way to stream music from my iPhone to a stereo which doesn't support Bluetooth, but does support connecting a standard audio cable to it. For example, I can take a standard audio cable and connect my iPhone directly to this stereo. However, I'm looking for a solution that will free me of wires on the iPhone side.
If there was some kind of Bluetooth device which has a standard audio cable as its output and as its input it uses a Bluetooth profile that the iPhone supports for wireless audio listening, I guess that would work.
Is this even possible?

A: The Sony Ericsson MBR-100 is a bluetooth adapter that should work.

A: I've been very pleased with my Belkin wall powered bluetooth receiver. It works well even with microwave oven and lots of other bluetooth in a house with chicken wire / plaster walls. (i.e. a disaster for 2.4 GHz radio)

A: I ended up getting the Sony DRC-BT30. It works really well and does exactly what I need it to do.
