Q: Why did I lose the ability to print to a networked printer? I have a Canon iP3600 printer connected to a networked hard drive and up until a few days ago I was able to print from it. however, i have now lost the ability to print ever since i downloaded Apple's updated software for the printer!
I have my mac partitioned and running Windows 7 and can still print perfectly from there, so the cables are obviously not the problem. I can still print perfectly if I connect the printer via USB directly to the Mac. I can even print a test page from the Print preferences page.
I just cannot print from a document. Print Queue keeps saying "Copying print data" but nothing happens! Have downloaded the latest driver from the Canon website and deleted and re-installed the printer several times and several ways to no avail.
Any ideas most welcome...

A: I had the same problem and this is what I did to fix it:


*

*Go to http://localhost:631/
If you get the "Web Interface is Disabled" message, run cupsctl WebInterface=yes in Terminal.

*Choose the Administration tab.


*Click Add Printer.

If you are required to login, use a local Administrator account.

*Select the printer (in my case it was automatically found).


A: I have exactly the same problem, installed driver numerous times, repaired permissions etc.. Then I installed Gutenprint (main page, Mac OSX page) and can print using that, although it seems to be terribly slow on my MP800R. Would still love to hear a different solution for getting the Canon drivers to work.
[edit]
After some more fiddling I got it working. Instead of adding the printer as an IP printer using LPD I added it via CUPS (http://localhost:631) and there for the connection I could choose canonijnetwork://Canon/MP800R?00.00.85.62.b9.2f The last bit will be different for everyone as it is the printer model and mac address. But after doing that I could print using the canon driver and also see the supply levels.
