Q: Downloading voicemail to my laptop How can I download my voicemail from the iPhone to my computer? 
Technically, I know it is not voicemail on the iPhone - it is in ATT's phone system but you knew what I meant.
How can I download my ATT voicemail from the iPhone/iTunes to my computer? 

A: I use an app called "iExplorer" (formerly iPhone Explorer).  It basically lets you reach into the phone to download, modify, replace, or add a file in any (or almost any) directory within the file structure.

A: You can't do it in iTunes, and you have to be jailbroken to do it. Here's a good tutorial.


*

*Jailbreak phone 

*Install OpenSSH from Cydia

*Install CyberDuck (or another SSH program) to your computer

*SSH into your iPhone from the computer (here's how)

*Navigate to /private/var/mobile/Library/Voicemail/

*Copy the desired .amr files


A: Or use Google voice and you can get them through the browser or emailed to you.

A: I use Phone View for this purpose and it works flawlessly. You do not have to jailbreak your phone for it to work.

A: There is another way. Per this instructables an iTunes backup of the iPhone contains the voicemail files in these folders:


*

*~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/
Mac

*\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
Windows XP

*\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
Vista and Windows 7


However, the bad news is that these voicemail files are mixed in with a ton of other random files from your iPhone, and all the files have long, meaningless filenames with no extensions. To determine what the files are, use the file * command. Note that the backup must not be encrypted for this approach to work.
file * | grep audio
file * | grep GSM

(on Windows install Cygwin and use the Cygwin terminal to get the file command)
The two file contents that seem likely are
RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit, mono 44100 Hz
Adaptive Multi-Rate Codec (GSM telephony)  


A: I have a Google Voice number that I just forward important voicemails to.
To do this in a typical voicemail system, you'd press 6 for more options, then 2 to forward it.
You can keep them in your Google account pretty much as long as you want, or you can simply download them at will.
I hope this is helpful.
