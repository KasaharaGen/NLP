Q: Support for Windows Live Messenger protocol in iChat I Love iChat and its sleek UI and prefer it to Adium or Windows Live Messenger for Mac. iChat now has ".impreferencepane" which allows the addition of support for new networks. My question is: has anybody found a plugin to support Windows Live Messenger within iChat?

A: DrinkBrainJuice is developing a MSN service plug in for iChat (exactly what you're searching): it's called Cocoon and is currently in Public Beta, so give it a try.

A: Gigaom have a rather convoluted method here, which involves downloading a program called Psi to act as a Jabber intermediary.
There's allegedly a chat gateway between MSN and Yahoo, which should allow an Yahoo user to talk to MSN users, but I can't find any concrete evidence of it online.
