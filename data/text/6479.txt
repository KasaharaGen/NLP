Q: Audible Authorization Issues Since iTunes 10.4 I'm having a couple of issues with my Audible Audiobooks after my upgrade to Lion and iTunes 10.4.


*

*Audible is permanently "authorized", even though it's not. When choosing the "Deauthorize Audible Account" menu option, I log into Audible, then I authenticate using my local/computer credentials, and a dialog pops up stating my account has been Deauthorized. Returning to the Advanced menu continues to show 'Deauthorize', in which I can continue this process over, and over, and over.

*When sync'ing my iOS device, I always get a dialog talking about my computer being unauthorized from allowing the audiobooks to sync.
There are no settings on audible.com regarding this authorization, so iTunes is the only frontend I can use to manage this, but clearly I'm stuck somewhere. How can I overcome this issue in order to listen to my audiobooks again?

A: *

*Quit iTunes on every computer you own (probably not necessary but can't hurt).

*Contact Audible.com support and ask them to de-authorize every device associated with your account.

*Go back into iTunes and re-authorize.
I've been an Audible customer for years and they have some of the best customer support in the entire tech industry. You can contact them via Email or phone:

A: I had the same issues you described, and if I remember correctly, I fixed this by unchecking Audiobooks when syncing my iPhone, and then re-enabled it + synced again.
