Q: How do I extract the audio signal from displayport? I have a macbook pro with minidisplayport (MDP) out.  It's plugged into an external monitor.  Sometimes via MDP-to-DualDVI, and sometimes directly via MDP.  I'd like to extract the digital audio signal from the MDP connection.  I've seen cables that go from MDP to DVI+Audio.  I want a cable that goes from MDP to MDP+Audio so that I can feed the audio into something other than my Apple Cinema display (which has cruddy speakers).

A: Since I don´t assume anyone to ever build a mini DisplayPort to miniDisplayPort+Audio Adapter, and the option of going mini-DP<>Dual DVI<>mini-DP seems to be quite expensive and bulky, why don´t you simply use the optical audio from your MacBook Pro´s audio output?
