Q: How can I mirror the display from an iOS device to an Apple TV? Is there a way to mirror the display of an iPod Touch or iPad to the Apple TV using AirPlay?
I know I can do it for Applications that support it, but for presentations it's often useful to just mirror the whole display, e.g. when wanting to show something in Safari.

A: If you have an iPad 2 and a iOS developer's account (or patience until this fall) you can try the hot new iOS 5 feature:
AirPlay Mirroring for iPad 2

A: If you're OK with a wired solution that doesn't use AirPlay, you'd be best off just connecting the device to the TV itself (not the Apple box). Cables/adapters for that (I haven't tested any of these):
iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch 4G       ==>    HDMI
iPad/iPhone 4/iPod Touch 4G    ==>    VGA
iPad/iPod Touch/iPhone/iPod    ==>    Component/RCA

A: On the same line of a wired solution, not airplay, there is an app available in cydia if you are jailbroken called TVOut2 Mirror that works good.
