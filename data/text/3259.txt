Q: weird problem : whenever I copy songs from my computer to my iphone it misses the first 30 seconds? Anyone experience this problem? It all of a sudden started happening for me.
When I download podcasts from my iphone, it seems to be fine, but when I download from my computer whether its songs or podcasts, it'll copy the song, but it'll be missing the first 30 seconds and last 10 or so seconds - sometimes it'll skip to different places during the song. Is there anything I can do about this?
I have a iphone 3gs version 4.2.1, jailbroken with greenpoison.

A: ZoneAlarm, and other firewalls, may occasionally interfere with the syncing process.  Turn off the firewall during sync to see if it's the problem.  If it syncs well after that, contact your firewall provider and ask for the proper setting so you don't have to disable it every time you want to sync.
Also, iOS 5.x can sync wirelessly, which may resolve the problem.

A: If you bring up the info window for a file in iTunes, and go to the Options tab, you'll see settings for the Start Time and Stop Time of the file. See if these are getting set erroneously.
