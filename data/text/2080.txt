Q: How can I re install Tiger without the original install or recovery DVDs? I have an iMac (PPC) with iSight. How can I re install Tiger without the original install or recovery DVDs?

A: You need to find Tiger DVDs in order to install the OS, friends and eBay (or its moral equivalent in your country) are a good place to start.

A: Anyway to install Tiger on your iMac you will need to get an image of it and try to make it bootable on other devices (if you don't want to use DVD). But the easiest way remains finding out the Tiger DVD.
