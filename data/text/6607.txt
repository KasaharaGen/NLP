Q: How to "star" messages or mark them as important in iPad mail app? I would like to mark messages as "important" in the iPad mail app via my gmail account. The app can move messages to a new folder, so I can put them in Gmail's "starred" folder, but that moves it out of the current label. How can I "star" messages on the iPads email app?

A: Since the release of iOS 5, it it possible to flag messages using the "Mark" dropdown menu.
