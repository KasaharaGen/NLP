Q: How can I require a user to change their password? I created a new account on a machine and gave it a default password but I want to ensure the user changes the password when they log into it for the first time. It's just a laptop with nothing special running client version of Mac OS X 10.6.8.
I'm sure it's possible, I remember seeing a check box where you could require the user to change their password at some point. 
Could someone refresh my memory on this or tell me how to achieve this goal?
