Q: How to download all my Flickr content? Are there any free apps to download my entire photostream from Flickr?
Or at least as much content as possible? I want to quit my Flickr account.

This great piece of software will do it.
Beware though, if don't have a pro account, you can't download the high resolution originals.

A: You can also try Bulkr - http://clipyourphotos.com/bulkr. It has a one click button to backup your Flickr photostream. Also, title, tags, description and geotag info embedding into EXIF is supported. 

A: Or you can give flickery a try (www.flickeryapp.com) - it's a full-featured flickr client, downloads EXIF info as far as I know and is currently on sale 48% off on the Mac App Store.
