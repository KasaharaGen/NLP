Q: Problem booting from a DVD: How do I eject the DVD? I tried to install Windows 7 on Bootcamp, but the Windows 7 boot CD has a boot problem about code 5.
The Windows 7 installation DVD is in the DVD driver. How can I eject the DVD from the drive, and boot normally? 

A: If it's an Intel based Mac, you can press either F12, or Eject, or the Mouse button on startup.
