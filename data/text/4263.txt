Q: What exactly is free incoming calls per second billing? I'm using iPhone Lite and was wondering:
What exactly is free incoming calls per second billing?
Is it the same as free incoming calls?
And do I only have 3 free month caller number display?

A: *

*Free incoming calls - you receive calls for free

*Per Second Billing - your calls are timed per second, not per blocks (etc. 5 seconds per x cents), and is for outgoing calls (when you call people, not when people call you)

*3 month free caller number display - you get to see the number of the person calling you for 3 months
