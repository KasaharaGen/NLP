Q: Create a HTML bundle? How can I create a bundle of HTML/CSS/JS/Image files that can be double-clicked to bring up a web browser? Ideally I would like to be able to use an icon on the file as well.
Is there a plugin for Chrome or Firefox that I could use to save page as a bundle?

A: Safari and TextEdit allow you to create a .webarchive package.
What I'd recommend is creating your site and open it in Safari to save it as .webarchive.
I'm not sure about customizing the iconâ€¦ not sure if that is supported for webarchive bundles.
