Q: How to turn off spindle of internal HDD on MacBook from command line? I'm going put SSD drive instead of DVD and move OS-X to SSD.
Big capacity HDD I'm gonig leave to have some place for large multimedia data and archives.
So I whant keep HHD in spindle off mode most time and mount it just on demand, what should I do to prevent HDD to be mounted and powered while system boot (after restart) and how to manage spindle with the command line?
Thank you!

A: to disable the drive from mounting during boot :
Find the uuid of the drive (in terminal):
diskutil info /Volumes/[name]

Then create a new file called /etc/fstab and in it put
UUID=34DFD44D-489C-1C22-01D8-DFDF288C102F none hfs rw,noauto 0 0

just replace the UUID above with the actual UUID of the drive.
Use the following command to view a list of drives/partitions
diskutil list

And then issue the mount command to mount the drive
sudo mount /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/DriveName

Obviously change the disk id and mount folder to suit your system.

A: sudo diskutil eject /dev/disk1 will turn off spindle
