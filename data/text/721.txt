Q: How often is Shift, Control, Alt or Command combined with the secondary click? One option I have for activating expose is to combined Shift, Control, Alt or Command with a secondary click. I am wondering if any of these combinations are likely to interfere with any useful commands on the Mac. Do any of these combinations already do anything useful?

A: Interference depends entirely on the application you are in when you use that combination of keys. Based on my experience, the only applications that get into that deep of a combination of keys (shift+control+cmd+[...]) are very robust like those found in Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Suite.

A: I've never seen those combos used in a Mac application, and I pay close attention to keyboard/mouse shortcuts. I think you're safe.
