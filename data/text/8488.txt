Q: Mouse cursor jittery when hover state on browsers in OS X Lion I recently upgraded to OS X Lion from Snow Leopard. One bug I've found is that in browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera), when you hover over any link, the cursor doesn't only change, it jitters around for a second before changing.
Since the bug is annoying but difficult to explain, I tried to make a short clip of it. This is weird: it doesn't show up on video when recorded with various screen recording softwares. How odd.
It's driving me nuts. Does anyone have a fix for this, or have experienced this problem?
I'm using:


*

*MacBook Pro 2010

*Trackpad

*All web browsers

*Hovering over links

A: Since this seems to persist, you might need to perform some more troubleshooting to narrow it down:


*

*Test by creating an entirely new user account on the Mac with the problem and see if the issue is repeatable.

*Log when and where the issue happens (assuming it's not a 100% guaranteed item that you can make happen any time you want in 5 seconds of setup).

*Install a clean OS onto an external USB drive and see if that setup has the issue.

*File a bug or work with Apple to isolate the issue further.


The clue that the screen recording is clear, but the artifact is visual seems like a great thing to capture with a video recording of the screen and a simultaneous camera recording of the image from the screen. The frequency and placement of the issue might be enough for someone else to diagnose a likely culprit.
