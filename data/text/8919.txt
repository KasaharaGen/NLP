Q: Does Evernote on the iPad have undo functionality? Am i wrong or it is true that the evernote app on iPad doesn't have undo funcionality ?
For example if I delete a line, it is gone for ever ?

A: As with the iPhone, if you shake the iPad vigorously, you get offered the choice of:


*

*Undo

*Cancel


For me, this doesn't feel at all natural on the iPad, and I imagine that's why some iPad applications (e.g. Textastic) provide their own Undo/Redo buttons.
Edit
Thanks to @Lizzan for also pointing out in the comments:

There's also an Undo button in the bottom left on the numerical keyboard - makes a bit more sense than shaking the iPad.
