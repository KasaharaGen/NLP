Q: Can I restore only selected files from Time Machine Backup after a fresh OS X re-install? I'm thinking to reinstall my Mac OS X on my Macbook Pro and starting fresh (instead of recovering from a Time Machine backup)
The question is:
If I do that, after OS X is reinstalled, will I be able to pick only certain files to be restored from my Time Machine backup?
The scenario is basically I want to start with a fresh OS X install and restore my iTunes library and possibly a few other documents.

A: You can do a fresh OSX re-install.
After that go into Time Machine and restore what you need.
