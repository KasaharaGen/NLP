Q: How to add Spotlight comments to the bundled OS X apps? I'd like to add a Spotlight comment to TextEdit.app. Is that possible?
What I've done:


*

*Open Finder

*Browse to /Applications/

*Select TextEdit

*Press ⌘ + I (Get Info)

*Click the lock icon to unlock the dialog

*Click on Spotlight comment text field

*Nothing happens. Even cut, copy and paste options are disabled in the context menu.


This seems to be the case for all the other OS X bundled apps as well (Font Book, iChat, iCal, …)
I could create an alias of the app and give comments to it, but are there any other ways?

A: You need to have write permission for the bundle. After you open the lock:


*

*Select 'Read & Write' permission for 'everyone'

*Add your comments

*Restore the permissions
