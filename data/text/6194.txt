A: It seems you can use Live Meeting Web Access to join, but not host meetings.

A: You might want to consider using the excellent Adobe Connect web-based screen-share/collaboration tool: truly cross-platform (hell, it supports PS3) and overall a better feature set.

A: Also note that Microsoft Live Meeting works in Safari but not on Chrome. At least on my MacBookPro and Leopard. In case you have other browser than Safari set as a default browser, you'll need to copy-paste the LiveMeeting link into Safari
