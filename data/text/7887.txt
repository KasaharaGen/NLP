Q: OS X Lion Mail.app sound effects bug This is one of the weirdest bug that I've observed:
It seems that Mail.app's audio notifications for new mail and sending mail accumulate and play in order of occurrence when I unplug external speakers. Just now it played a series of more than 100 notifications (mostly new mail notification).
It's not big enough that I want to fix it but I just wanted to know if anyone experienced something similar.
It happened on an iMac that was upgraded to OS X Lion from Snow Leopard.

A: I don't have an answer, but here is how to reproduce the error. Open mail.app then call someone on FaceTime. 

A: If this bug is repeatable and happens often you should consider filing a bug with Apple via their, Apple Bug Reporter.
