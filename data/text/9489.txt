Q: How can I use Siri to select between multiple email addresses? When using Siri to send an email to a contact with multiple email addresses, I can't find a way to select one of the addresses in a hands-free way (without clicking with my finger).  Siri reads out the two addresses, and then gives me a voice prompt to pick one, but when I say one of them back it just loops back to the "Which email address for..." prompt.
Anyone know what to say here?  I've tried just saying the domain of the address, "one", "the first one", the entire email address, but none of them work.

A: Ok this is what i saw when i asked SIRI to send a mail to a contact with multiple address, i then chose 'Home' and siri asked me what should she send!. It was pretty straight forward IMHO, so i suggest you try to disable/enable SIRI, if that doesn't work, then i think you will have to restore iOS option. Hope this helps mate 


A: When you are looking at the Contact information on the iPhone, tap 'Edit' (top right corner).
Then tap the label next to the email address for that contact, and you should see this:

If you tap that Edit button (shown here; again, top right), you can choose "+ Add Custom Label" to make your own.
(That's how it works for .Mac/MobileMe/iCloud and Gmail/Google Apps, I assume it is the same for Outlook.)
Siri definitely uses those labels when choosing which email address to use.

(Aside: I have actually gone through many of my contacts and if I have more than one email address for them, I put the primary one in the email field, and move the other to the "Notes" in case it stops working. Ditto for phone numbers. If I always call you on your cell phone, or always call your work number, the other numbers move to the notes section. YMMV.)
