Q: Opening a new file in TextMate opens the last opened file as well Here is a small annoyance that I have with TextMate. When I want to open a new file in TextMate when it's not running it also opens the last opened file. Now for some cases that's just nice of him to do but in most cases I end-up closing the previous file. Maybe this is a simple setup/preference issue? Any ideas?

A: It's not something you can set in the app preferences.
If you want to change this behavior, open Terminal.app and type
defaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDisableSessionRestore 1

This will make Textmate not remember the last session.
Change the 1 by 0 if you want the default behavior.

A: This behavior is bypassed in Textmate 2 by holding shift when opening Textmate 2.
