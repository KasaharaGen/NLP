Q: Moving 'Sites' folder to Dropbox I'm trying to move my standard ~/Sites folder, or the global Sites folder (in Library/WebServer/Documents) to my Dropbox folder, and make this usable with Web Sharing, PHP, MySQL etc.
So far I have changed the httpd.conf in etc/apache2 to overwrite these lines:
# original: DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
DocumentRoot "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/users/cannyboy/Dropbox/Sites"
# original: <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">
<Directory "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/users/cannyboy/Dropbox/Sites">

But when I browse http://localhost I get:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work?

A: You could just move the Sites folder into the Dropbox folder - and then make a link/alias from the new Dropbox location back to ~/Sites.
After you've moved the Sites folder into Dropbox you right click on the Sites folder in Dropbox, and then choose "Make Alias" and move this alias into ~/ (remember to rename it to Sites) - alternativ create the alias this way: Can I create Windows-style alias in Finder?

A: I don't know default mod for Dropbox folder, but Sites have read access for anyone (such as apache web server) :
ls -Alh ~/

drwx------+ 26 Bil   staff   884B 25 jui 12:40 Desktop

To change access of Dropbox, type in Terminal.app 
chmod a+r ~/Dropbox

But be careful, once you've change directory's mod, everybody can read view/read it's content.
