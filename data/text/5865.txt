Q: Can I use iBooks on my MacBook Pro I'd love to be able to use iBooks on my laptop. Is that possible? Maybe if I install Lion?

A: No, it's an iOS application.  It will not run on OS X.
To read DRM-free e-books on your Mac, there are 3rd party Apps like Calibre. But even they can't read the DRM-encrypted books from the iBooks store.
