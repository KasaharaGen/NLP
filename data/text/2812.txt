Q: How can I read full song title on my iPod touch or iPhone? When I play or select songs on my iPod touch 4G I often can not read the full title of the song when it is very long. In all views (Coverflow front, coverflow back, now playing portrait mode, playlist) it is always truncated. Especially for classical music this is really annoying because the titles are something in the lines of "Beethoven: The Complete String Quartetts" -  "String Quartett #3 in D Op. 18/3 - 1. Allegro". Is there some trick to view the complete title?

A: As of iOS 5, this problem is even simpler. Many views will scroll overflowing information, but you can also simply tap and hold on many sources of text in order to view them in a significantly smaller font size in a back pop-up tooltip, which greatly expands the amount of text that can be fit in the width of the iPhone's screen size.
Note that my previous answer still applies (below), but this tooltip is usually quite a bit faster and much more direct.

For all iOS versions before iOS 5:
My answer on the View Full Podcast Title Question covers this as well. You can use Cover Flow view (rotate your device to Landscape while in the iPod/Music app after selecting a song) in order to greatly increase the amount of room used to display song information.
Your title is particularly large, I don't know what the landscape/Cover Flow view limit is. I don't have any songs that exceed it yet :).
