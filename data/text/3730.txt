How to record phone conversation in iPhone 4?

A: Recorder
Recorder lets you record outgoing calls by using a 415 dial-in number, but for a fee ($2/hour, $13/8 hours).

Check it out on the iTunes store and purchase it for 99 cents

A: To my knowledge the iPhone SDK switches off the microphone to 3rd party applications during a voice call.  There may be applications available if you have a jailbroken phone.
There is products such as thecallrecordercard that may be off assistance, in that they allow you to record voice calls by using your iPhone and their service.

A: Be aware that there are significant legal restrictions on recording phone calls, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction -- make sure you know what they are and follow them. For example, in most US states, you need to notify the other party they are being recorded and/or get their consent (Google can find you the specifics).

A: Unfortunately, no native or simple way to do this - unlike many other phones.
I believe one option might be using the speaker and any voice recorder, such as the Voice Memo built in app. Despite some limitations it could be enough if you don't care about the sound quality.
See if SpoofApp fits your needs. It's one of the first recording call apps out there, as already pointed out in another possible duplicate question, and it even moved from being on Cydia to the Apple Store. The app is free, the call recording is not as it's a "complicated made simple" service.
If you're fine with recording just VOIP calls, which can be done for free and within your device without needing to call a 3rd party number, try Mobile VOIP.

A: Perhaps there is something out there to intercept the conversation on the hardware level using the headphone jack? Some kind of passthrough device you would plug into the headphone jack and then you plug your mic-equipped headphones into said device. There has to be something out like that.

A: I have used a service in the past to record phone conversations
they were very helpful and did a great job in setting me up with a good solution.
