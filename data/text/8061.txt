Q: Changing iCloud id to email: The requested application was not found on this server I am trying out iCloud right now but it keeps telling me:
An Apple ID that is an email address is required to use iCloud.

I am using a non email username(that I use for itunes and the app store) so I followed the link to convert it but going to https://appleid.apple.com redirects me to: 
https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/
and gives me the above error. So what should I do now? 

A: Reload the page. The servers are overloaded (this question was posted on the iCloud launch day).
