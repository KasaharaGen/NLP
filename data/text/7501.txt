Q: Connecting camera to the iPad2 I want to connect a camera (web cam or just regular digital camera) to the iPad and download the pictures from the camera and showing it on the iPad. I need it to be live - take a picture with the camera and than download it from the camera into the iPad. any suggestions?
Is there a way to connect the camera to the iPad and connect the power supply of the iPad at the same time (the iPad should be connected to power supply all the time).
if it is not possible is there any other tablets which can make these requirements?
Thanks in advance,
Shahar.

A: Yes this is possible with the iPad2 see iPad Camera Connection Kit
and also with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 Galaxy Tabâ„¢ Adapter (USB)

A: How about buying an Eye-Fi memory card. It's memory cards with Wifi built in. With Direct Mode you should be able to transfer the pictures on the fly.
Make sure you check that the card you buy is Direct Mode compatible by studying their compare cards chart.
