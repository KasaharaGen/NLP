Q: iPod touch calendar - all of my events AM and PM are switched So I recently got an iPod touch and synced it with my computer. I set it up to sync with iCal. Unfortunately, on my iPod, all of my events are switched from AM to PM and vice versa. Or at least they are moved 12 hours forward/backward.
Does anybody have any idea how to fix it? I'm trying to avoid wiping it clean, but if that's the only option, I will, because I really want to have iCal on my device.
