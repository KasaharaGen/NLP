Q: Is a "Not Charging" iPad still drawing power when not sleeping When an iPad is "not charging" and is not sleeping, is it still drawing power from the USB port so it doesn't drain or at least drain slower?

A: Yes.  It's just that the power it's drawing is not enough to both run the device and charge the battery at the same time.
