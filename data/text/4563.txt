Q: OS X Lion - download once and install on multiple computers I have multiple computers which I will be installing Lion on. Is it possible to download it once and install on those computers?

A: It will be, as announced on WWDC 2011 keynote.
It will be delivered via the App Store for $29, and you can use it to update your other authorized Macs as well.
I'm not to keen with the details. Sorry.

A: Instructions taken from the following URL: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/07/how-to-burn-a-lion-boot-disc/


*

*Use Finder to locate the Mac OS X Lion installer, right-click and select "Show Package Contents."

*Find the SharedSupport folder and look for a file named "InstallESD.dmg." This is the Lion Boot Disc image.

*Copy the "InstallESD.dmg" file to another folder, such as your desktop.

*Launch Disk Utility and click the burn button.

*Select the "InstallESD.dmg" copy as the image to burn, insert a DVD, and in a few minutes, you will have a brand new Lion Boot Disc.


A: Since it complies to the same rules as other mac apps, you only need to buy Lion once.
At least that is what I recall from seeing the WWCD video.
