Q: How can I fix an iPhone 2G that is stuck on the connect to iTunes screen? I have an old iPhone 2G (first generation) that I plan on using basically as an iPod touch (not using the phone portion).  I no longer have the AT&T service on that phone.  I installed an update to the firmware (stupidly) this morning because iTunes prompted me too... and now the phone seems to basically be bricked.  Upon completing the firmware update I was stuck at the "connect to iTunes/emergency" screen.
For the past 10 hours, I have tried to restore, I have booted into DFU mode. I have even resorted to attempted jailbreaks, all to no avail.  No matter what I do, I still get that "connect to iTunes/emergency" screen, and while the "iPhone" displays under Devices in iTunes, the iTunes page simply says "iPhone". There is no Summary Page, no iPhone section, no version section, no backup section, etc.
I installed iTunes 10.5 and I am pretty sure the firmware for the 2G phone is 1.1.3 (although I had attempted to roll it back).
Does anyone have any ideas on why this is happening and what can be done to get this iPhone back up and running?

A: Jailbreaking is the easiest way to kill the activation process, fortunately for you the 2G is cracked on such a low level is a one shot process there's a guide up on iClarified how to do it. 
After that you should go have a look at which is a jailbroken firmware with a lot of the features that the iPhone 2G ended up missing out on.

A: Your phone is restored and updated to new firmware, to activate the phone you need to have AT&T service. 
Plan B: Jailbreak it with Cydia. It will unlock your phone and you can use it with other service providers. There are many videos on youtube to guide you.
