Q: Wireless keyboard on iPad2 I finally got my wireless keyboard for my iPad and I'm quite disappointed. Beside the media controls the whole stuff from the dock-keyboard doesn't work on the wireless one. What's even worse is that I have to disconnect the keyboard when I take the iPad away from the desk and go to the balcony. Is there any way to get the soft-keypad back, when the wireless keyboard is connected without going to the keyboard and pressing the eject-key?

A: Go to Settings -> General -> Bluetooth and switch bluetooth off.

A: Your question seems very similar to this one:
Re-enabling virtual iPad keyboard with paired Bluetooth keyboard
I think that the same answers will apply.
