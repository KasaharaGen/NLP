Q: Is there a difference between the "configurable" and installable memory limit? On Apple's iMac page, it says:

Configurable to 8GB (all models) or 16GB (select models)

However both Apple's iMac: How to remove or install memory page and Crucial.com indicate that all of the 2011 iMac models are configurable to 16 GB. Does the above quote simply mean than select models are only configurable to 16 GB on the Apple online store? If I buy the $1200 iMac (MC309LL/A), I should be able to install 16 GB of RAM bought separately from Crucial, correct?

A: Correct. You may even upgrade it to 32GB.

A: Apple offers CTO and will let you fill your iMac (Late 2011) with RAM modules sized at 2 GB and 4 GB each. 
From Apple, the entry level MC309LL/A has two RAM slots so you can take it to 8 GB (2 x 4 GB SO-DIMM) but many reputable vendors are selling 8 GB modules that seem to work well and without issue on that hardware - 16 GB (2 x 8 GB SO-DIMM).
The rest of the Late 2011 iMacs have 4 RAM slots, so you can take them to 32 GB (4 x 8 GB SO-DIMM) even though Apple intends / configures / supports / recommends a max of 16 GB (4 x 4 GB SO-DIMM) for the rest of the lineup.
