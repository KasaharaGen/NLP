Q: 404s "tracker" for Mac OS X I'm looking for OS X software that can help me track 404 errors on my site.

A: What are you using to watch the stats on your website? Most stats packages that read the logs will give you a 404 report (eg. AWStats, Summary).
If you're looking for a program to run on your Mac to check that for you; Piltdown Link Checker, Integrity, WebLight or LinkByLink are all options.

A: If you want to track broken links, the best way to do it is checking the production/online site. I’ve used BrokenLinkCheck in the past. It’s free and it delivers. Your mileage may vary.
