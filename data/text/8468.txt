Q: iTunes is trying to upgrade to iOS 4.3.5 instead of iOS 5 Currently I'm running iOS 4.3.3 on my iPad.
I was expecting to ugrade to iOS 5 directly.but iTunes is trying to upgrade to iOS 4.3.5.
Do I need to first upgrade to 4.3.5 and then to iOS 5? Is there any way to upgrade to iOS 5 directly?
I can, however, download the ipsw. But anyway I would like to know.

A: I had the same issue. Connected my iPad, started iTunes, and was offered iOS 4.3.5 (and this was just last week!). I had iTunes up to date and everything.
I canceled the upgrade, closed and reopened iTunes, and it then decided to offer to upgrade to 5.0.
I think it will resolve itself. Try restarting.

A: What version of iTunes are you using? 
To upgrade to iOS 5 you need the latest iTunes 10.5, since the earlier versions do not recognize the iOS 5 IPSW and cannot sync with iOS 5. They will also not detect the iOS 5 upgrade on the iTunes server.
