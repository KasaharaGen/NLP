Q: How do I view a song's composer on my iPod touch? Is there any way of viewing the composer of a particular song in the Ipod Touch? I know you can sort songs by composer, but what I want to do is while listening to a particular album (classical music), view the composers of the different songs.

A: There's a small app you can find here
Don't worry, it's all Japanese. But the app works really fine and reads all (!) ID3 tags of the current song playing.
Since I am listening preferably to classical music, too, I hate iTunes non-existent ability to show all relevant tag information.

A: I don't think this is possible in the default 'Music' app which is quite simple and straightforward. The only solution would be to add the composer to the track's title but I suppose you already thought about this one...
Finding another app for paying music but with more options would be another solution. Are you open to having another application for playing music?
