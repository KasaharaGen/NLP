Q: Cursor selection behavior When clicking something on the Mac screen, the cursor will 
a) take up residence as directed, 
If I click again, it will 
b) select the whole word, 
If I click again, it will
c) select the whole passage. 
In Windows, I can click a fourth time, and the cursor will return to "a," the "residence" mode.  On the Mac, it stays in "whole passage" mode. I have to move the cursor out of text, so restore it to "a."
I frequently click a fourth time and expect it to return to mode A. I don't like having to correct this and move the cursor.
How can I make the fourth click return to mode A, "residence"?

A: Clicking will reset to the "residence" mode provided that you leave enough time after the previous clicks that it isn't treated as a quadruple click.  At least, that's the way it works for me in Chrome on my MacBook Pro.
