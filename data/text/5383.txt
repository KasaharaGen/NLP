Q: How do I download folders through FTP in Terminal? How do I download a whole folder through FTP in Terminal?

A: Another way is to use curl 
curl ftp://ftp.com/mp3/* --user login:password -o /myfolder/*

I think this is working, or file by file 
curl ftp://ftp.com/mp3/mymusic.zip --user login:password -o mymusic.zip

I hope this helped.

A: I am using
wget -r -l 10 --ftp-user='FTP_USER' --ftp-password='FTP_PASSWORD' \
    ftp://ftp.server.com/folder_to_download/*

Unfortunately wget doesn't support parallel downloads.

A: Use scp (documentation) or sftp (documentation)
scp -r login@myserverip:/remote/directory/path/ mylocaldirectory


A: I had to download 22'000+ webcam pictures from my web server, which is a bit of a challenge for both the Finder and my FTP program CyberDuck.
So I did the following (based on @bmike's answer):
mkdir ~/Desktop/image-dump-myserver
ftp ftp://myuser@myserver.com
# enter password

# You're now in the ftp console (where the world is still okay)

# Set the local folder
lcd ~/Desktop/image-dump-myserver

# cd into the desired folder (`ls`, `pwd` etc. all work here)
cd /httpdocs/images

# Toggle the interactive mode
prompt

# Download the desired files (all the images in my case)
mget *.jpg

Then the files are being downloaded into the desired folder:
local: image1433509292_1582.jpg remote: image1433509292_1582.jpg

A: mget is the closest you can get with the included FTP binary. You have to mkdir and cd/lcd and then get all the files than match a pattern like *
The prompt toggle may come in handy. 
FTP works within a directory, not on directories as containers of files. If you absolutely had to get the job done and ftp was the only tool you could use - you could cobble together an expect script to drive ftp for you. 
Thankfully there are alternatives like scp|rsync|wget to get whole directories worth of files.

A: follow this instruction : 
type
ftp

then you are in ftp looking like
ftp>

then you open ip of server
ftp> open xx.xxx.xxx.xx

then it will ask for username, you will provide
Name:(your ftp server): your_username

then it wil ask for password
Password:  your_password

then you should be logged in and see the ftp> shell again,
you can type "ls" to list all files and you can navigate like in inix with cd
when you found your filename you can download it with
ftp> get filename

et voila, the file will be downloaded to the directory you opened shell localy from
you cant download directorys, but you could navigate into your directory and download multiple e.g all files 
Task: Download Multiple Files
You need to use mget command as follows to copy multiple files from the remote ftp server to the local system. You may be prompted for a yes/no (Y/N) answer before transferring each file (you can disable prompt by passing the -i option to ftp client). To download all files, enter:
ftp> mget *
