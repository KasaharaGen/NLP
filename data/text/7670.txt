Q: What should I do with my original RAM after an upgrade? I just upgraded my 13" MacBook Pro (mid-2009) from 2 GB of memory to 8 GB of RAM.  What a difference!
I'm wondering what I can/should do with the old sticks.

A: Several threads on MacRumors say to keep it for troubleshooting and/or if you need to send it in for warranty service:

*Upgraded from 2gb to 4gb - what to do with old Memory?
"2x1GB is worth so little so you're better off keeping it for troubleshooting purposes."

*What to do with the old memory on the macbook
"I would hold on to the memory; if you ever need to take it in for service, it's better to have the original memory in it."
"Keep them for warranty"

*what can i do with old ram? 
"Apple guidelines are that if you do have 3rd party hardware installed, they won't service it."

A: Find some more RAM pieces and then make the Byte Light. :)
