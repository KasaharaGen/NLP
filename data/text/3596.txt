Q: How to send an email from command line? How to send an email from command line or script? I want to be able to run the script programmatically by passing the receiver and the message.

A: You may want to check out postfixconf that enables and configures OS X to send emails from the command line (using your input). 
It is based on the postfix configuration that are well documented on the web here, here and here.

A: There are two programs that I am aware of which will easily allow you to configure your Mac to send email from the command line.
I have written up HOWTOs for both of them:


*

*mailsend

*msmtp
Of the two, I suggest msmtp.
Configuration is complicated enough that I'm not sure if I should replicate all of the steps here, but I will mention that if you use
Homebrew
you can install msmtp using
brew install msmtp --with-macosx-keyring
Then the rest is just a matter of setting up the related configuration files
The first is /usr/local/etc/msmtprc
# Begin msmtprc
# Set default values for all following accounts.
defaults
tls on
logfile ~/.msmtp.log

# A first gmail address
account example@gmail.com
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
protocol smtp
auth on
from example@gmail.com
user example@gmail.com
tls on
tls_starttls on

# this next line is crucial: you have to point to the correct security certificate for GMail.
# If this doesn't work, check the mstmp documentation
# at http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/documentation.html for help
#
# This next line should all be on one long line:
tls_trust_file /path/to/Thawte Roots/Thawte SSLWeb Server Roots/thawte Premium Server CA/Thawte Premium Server CA.pem

# Set a default account
# You need to set a default account for Mail
account default : example@gmail.com

# end msmtprc

Note that tls_trust_file line should point to wherever you have downloaded and installed the certificates from https://www.thawte.com/roots/index.html.
I put mine in ~/Dropbox/Thawte Roots so that I can have it on all of my Macs.
Then you need a ~/.mailrc file to say where the msmtp binary is located. If you use brew it will be /usr/local/bin/msmtp so the file would look like this:
set sendmail="/usr/local/bin/msmtp"

The last but crucial step is making sure your Keychain has the information exactly in the format that msmtp will expect it:

I think that covers most of the details. See http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/04/msmtp-a-free-tool-to-send-email-from-terminal/ if you want a few more specifics.

A: mail -s subject someone@example.com 
type your message, press Ctrl+D to finish

A: The most basic way to send mail is trough a telnet session with the smtp server of your provider/network. After you contacted the server and after every command the server will answer if it accepts the command with something like "250 OK", or if not with an error message.
All details can be found in RFC2821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, Google for it.
This basic way is great for testing why something goes wrong sending mail, but I think it's quite complicated to script it full proof.
First get an command-line interface on your computer, by starting Terminal. Then continue with the following commands, one after one.
Open a telnet session to port 25 of the smtp server of your provider/network
telnet name_or_ip_of_smtp_server 25

say hello plus the internetname of your provider/network, like abc.com
EHLO name_of_your_network

a from=return address is needed, the < and > are part of the command
MAIL FROM:<your_email_adress>

give one or more destinations, the < and > are part of the command
RCPT TO:<destination_email_address>
RCPT TO:<second_destination_email_address>
RCPT TO:<etc_destination_email_address>

tell the server you want start sending data
DATA

now the server should answer you can start sending your mail and goes into data-mode
your data
more data
etc

now finish data with a dot as only char on a line
.

the server goes back to command-mode so you can quit
QUIT


A: This worked for me, it was written with Lion in mind but works for Mountain Lion. Btw this is using Gmail so if you're not...
You don't need to download anything! (just setup a gmail account)
http://www.anujgakhar.com/2011/12/09/using-macosx-lion-command-line-mail-with-gmail-as-smtp/
Configure Postfix for Gmail SMTP Edit file /etc/postfix/main.cf
sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf

and add in the following below the commented out relayhosts :-
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain

Generate sasl_password if not already exists
sudo vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

and enter in the following:-
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 username@gmail.com:password

Run the following commands
sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo launchctl stop org.postfix.master
sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master

And you are doneâ€¦.
Now, you should be able to send emails from within the command line e.g. to send the contents of a directory as a tree to an email address
tree /var/www/somefolder | mail -s "contents" your@yourdomain.com


A: mtcmail is another option: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33505/mtcmail-cli.

A: Since it's Unix based, you can use sendmail command.
