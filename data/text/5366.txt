Q: How do you disable the zoom effect / window animations in the new OS X Lion? I'd like to disable the Zoom effect that the windows produce when they are being opened. Does anyone know a way to disable them?

A: Open Terminal.app In your /Applications/Utilies folder and run the following command:
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO

and press Enter
Note: Changes might only take place after restarting your mac
