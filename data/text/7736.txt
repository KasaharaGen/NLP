Q: Run through terminal PYTHON Is there a way on a mac to make it so when you click on a python script it runs python filename.py through terminal?

A: Yes, this is possible with multiple methods. The easiest is simply right-clicking the script, opening the Get Info window and changing Open With to Python Launcher (x.x.x).

A: According to the Python Documentation: 4.1.1. How to run a Python script, you can set "Python Launcher" to your default program which uses pythonw. This assumes you have Leopard or later.
