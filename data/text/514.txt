Q: Is it possible to activate an iPhone 4 without a SIM? So we bought an iPhone 4 from the Apple store. But we didn't get a micro-SIM as there are no PAYG tariffs on micro-SIM available.
Is there anyway to activate the device without getting hold of a SIM? I don't want to sign up to a contract just to develop with.

A: Maybe you know somenone who owns an iPhone 4 already. Ask her/him for the micro SIM, put it into your device, activate your iPhone and give the micro SIM back to the other person.

A: I used this excellent description (PDF) to cut my normal SIM into microSIM format. It was very easy to follow and it works perfectly!

A: If all you need is a PAYG SIM, you should note that micro-SIMs are physically the same as standard SIMs except for the shape of the plastic surrounding the chip. I think that with a bit of careful cutting you can trim away the excess plastic and use any PAYG SIM.
If you Google "trim micro sim" you'll find a few blog posts describing the process.

A: You could jailbraik the phone to activate it without the SIM card.
