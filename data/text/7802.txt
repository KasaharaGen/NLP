Q: Customizing Finder like Windows File Explorer I am migrating from Windows to Mac OS X. I really like Windows file explorer. In the left panel, a tree of folders shows up, and in the right panel, files show up. In addition, I enjoy naming files very long such as project1_year1_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A01.docx,
and as I proceed I create:

`project1_year1_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A01.docx`
`project1_year1_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A02.docx`
`project1_year1_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A03.docx`
`project1_year2_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A01.docx`
`project1_year2_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A02.docx`
`project1_year2_this_project_is_about_something_ver_A03.docx`

In Mac OS X, it might look something like:

`project1_year.......docx`
`project1_year.......docx`
`project1_year.......docx`
`project1_year.......docx`
`project1_year.......docx`
`project1_year.......docx`

which is a total mess. I think I was able to adjust the column length, but I want to see long file names without adjusting it and when I save as a new file name inside software like MS Word.
Is there any workaround to make Finder look like what I want? (1) a tree of folders, and (2) long file names without showing any other file information column.

A: *

*Go to List View.

*Control-click on the bar that says "Name  Date Modified  Size  " etc.

*Uncheck all the fields (Date modified, Size, Kind, etc.)


You should now have long filenames and expandable folders.
