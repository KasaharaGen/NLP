Q: AirPlay working with iPad but rarely with iTunes on my mac? I don't get why, when I play music with AirPlay from my iPad it always work, but with iTunes on my mac it rarely work. It says after 10 seconds:
The AirPlay device “My Airport Express” cannot be found on your network. 

The iPad works perfectly instead.
It worked also on the mac few times (so it should be correctly configured).
thanks
