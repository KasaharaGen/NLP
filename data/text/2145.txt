Q: How do I set up DynDNS on my MacBook? I want to create a host name that points to my MacBook dynamically, so I can have a chance to take back the control if it was stolen. I opened ssh and vnc, but I have no idea how to find my machine. Maybe DynDNS is a solution?

A: Go to www.dyndns.com and register.  Then install the dynamic updater on your Mac and follow the installation instructions.  This will then connect to www.dyndns.com and update your DNS information whenever your Mac is connected to the internet.  You could then use SSH or other means to log onto your Mac from an iPhone or other computer/Mac by connecting to the URL (e.g. - mymacbook.dyndns.com) you select upon registering on dyndns.com.
There are another couple of steps.  You need to get your broadband router to forward traffic coming in on specific ports to your Mac.  You should be able to find a how-to on www.portforward.com for your router model. You also need to setup a static IP for your Mac which is best done on your router.  Your routers documentation should tell you how to do this.

A: Another option (a bit more pricey) in addition to the one suggested by Griffo's would be signing up for MobileMe ("Back to my Mac").
Or if you are by chance operating your own domain name server somewhere, you can set up dynamic DNS there yourself through the Sharing->Edit... tab.
