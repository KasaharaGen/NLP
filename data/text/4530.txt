Q: MacBook Pro Dual LCD Would it be possible to customize a macbook so that it has 2 screens instead of 1?
what i mean is, could i hook up the lcd from another macbook and connect so that it has 2 screens..
if it could work, would i have to connect it via minidisplayport or is there a way to connect it to the video board..
essentially something like this..
