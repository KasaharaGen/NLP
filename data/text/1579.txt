Q: history of version / price changes for itunes apps I'm looking to get "app activity" type information from pages like these. http://appshopper.com/social-networking/tweetee
only that I want to be able to get such information via "Appid" that apple used for each app on the appstore. anyone have any ideas on how I might do that?

A: AppShopper does this.  I don't know the answer but you could ask them if there's a way!
