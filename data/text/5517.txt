Q: Why safari hangs right after installation on Windows XP? I've just installed Safari on Windows XP SP3 and after succesful installation it starts and just hangs up. I also see process Webkit2Webprocess.exe which uses 100% of one core and nothing else happens. 
Can you please give me some hints how to fix this?

A: Safari hangs when it cannot find a network, like when you need to specify proxy settings. Try on a network that doesn't need a proxy; it will not hang there.
