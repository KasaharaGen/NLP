Q: How do I extract an ECM archive in Mac OS X Lion? I came across a ECM archive that I need to extract.
The Unarchiver can't handle this format, and I'm not sure about other utilities.
How do I extract ECM in Mac OS X Lion?

A: You can use the ECM tools created by Neill Corlett, the creator of ECM. Just run "unecm" on the file.
There are binaries for Mac here
If that seems intimidating, there is a youtube walkthrough here that uses a GUI and contains links to the tools used.
