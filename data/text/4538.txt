Q: How do I install Homebrew on Tiger? According to this previous question, I want to install Homebrew Tiger branch on my iBook running ... well, Tiger.
Unfortunatly, when running the Ruby one-liner,
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731/39fc1416e34b9f6db201b4a026181f4ceb7cfa74)"

I always get the following error :
This script requires the user nicolas to be in the staff group. If this
sucks for you then you can install Homebrew in your home directory or
however
you please; please refer to the website. If you still want to use this 
script
the following command should work:

dscl /Local/Default -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership $USER

I have unsuccessfully tried to add myself as a member of the staff group.
What can I do to install Homebrew on my Tiger mac ?
Thanks
EDIT Yes, I have a version of XCode for my platform, it's a legacy 2.5 that I installed specifically for that purpose.
Concerning the Ruby script, a rapid overview of its code indicates that the error appears as invoking groups does not return the staff group.
And indeed, when I issue this command by hand, I get
$ groups
nicolas appserveradm appserverusr admin

So, how can I add myself to the staff group in a fashion that this command will understand ?

A: So, I finally managed to have a working version of homebrew, but it wasn't that simple.
First, download from sources and make install of Git following these instructions.
Then, using git, get the sceaga Tiger branch of Homebrew.
All should then work correctly (more or less).
EDIT There seems to be a tarball hidden somwhere that could be used with root installation procedure. It has the obvious interest of avoiding one to install git just for the sake of having a running homebrew to ... install another git version.

A: Here is the single-step install of Homebrew on Tiger PPC:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://raw.github.com/gist/1144389/5723f23d03c49912ffd460d32e958e71d7e0cd67/install_homebrew.rb)"

It installs sceaga's Tiger branch, precisely the one you quote aboveâ€¦
I've just forked the former install_homebrew.rb and modified it in order to work under Tiger PPC.
You can review my code here

A: I haven't Tiger, so something only from my memory:
the above dscl should work. Or you can try the following:
dscl . -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership $USER

you can ensure who is added with
echo $USER

should print your short username.
If this does not works, here is the more dangerous way. If I remember good, on Tiger is an application /Applications/Utilities/Netinfo Manager.app (or something like with Netino)
You should start it and check it. Unfortunately I'm not remembering what exactly you must do. One thing: when you change something, in the menu is something like "Restart Netinfo Server", and you must restart it, when you make changes.
Warning: REALLY (really really!) be very careful. You can lock out yourself from the machine, and will must start OS in singeleuser mode to restore things - and probably will not get any help, because here are only few users with Tiger.
I was thinking about this post and maybe would be better write nothing - because of the dangerous command. But, on the other side - if you do things carefully (google for Netinfo), you can easily done your problem.
Be careful - good luck. ;)

A: Tigerbrew: homebrew forked for Tiger PPC
Tigerbrew incorporates work from sceaga's Tiger branch. It installs under the admin group, so you don't have to add yourself to the staff group.
Installation:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/go)"
