Q: After Lion can't access NTFS shared folders any more After upgrading to Lion, my NTFS shared folders are no longer accessible. I can see the shared folder, but when I try to enter from Windows 7 box it says Windows cannot access \path\to\usbsharedresource.
Even BOOTCAMP partition which was shared and working now inaccessible... 
SMB is ON.

A: Upgrading to Lion breaks SMB.  Something to do with UUIDs or GUIDs I think.
Create a new user on the system, give that new user access privileges through the SMB share, and connect to the share using the new user name/password.  Accounts that existed pre-Lion upgrade won't work due to this UUID problem.

A: MacFuse is broken in Lion. Try http://www.offthehill.org/articles/2010/12/31/macfuse-for-64-bit-snow-leopard.

A: A friend of mine had a similar problem. After upgrading from Snowleopard to Lion he could no longer access his Windows partition.
He bought and installed Tuxera NTFS for Mac (There is also a trial available).
For him it worked and he could again read and write his NTFS partition.

A: Apple has changed the Samba's version that comes with Lion due to problems related to licenses and stuff.
Fortunately for you, I was having the same problem and I have found a solution for it :)
If you follow the instructions on the following link, you will be able to share your folders again.
Attention: It's better if you're comfortable with Terminal and a few commands.
