Q: In Macbook Pro 17", what's the difference between processors? 
What's the difference between processors here, other than 0.1GHz? Are there actual model numbers given for the processors so I can look them up on Intel's website? I'd like to see the real differences, and information seems sparse on the Apple store page. Is it worth $250 for the difference? 

A: *

*2.5 GHz (2860QM)

*

*2.5GHz base clock, 3.6GHz max TurboBoost clock.

*8MB cache.

*Bus/core ratio: 25.


*2.4 GHz (2760QM) 

*

*2.4GHz base clock, 3.5GHz max TurboBoost clock.

*6MB cache.

*Bus/core ratio: 24.



You can compare the features side-by-side here.
The actual difference is 4x0.1 GHz. 
The links will tell you that there is no difference besides the clock speed, cache and bus/core ratio. Exactly the same specifications for advanced technologies, memory and expansions.
According to this source there is a 5.2% difference in performance. 7987 vs 7592 with PassMark.

A: The 2.4 GHz CPU only has 6 MB of L3 cache (in comparison to the 2.5 GHz' 8 MB) in addition to the infinitesimal clock speed increase. Is it worth an additional $250? I would say no, but for those looking to eek out as much speed as possible, perhaps.
I'm not aware of any benchmarks that compared these two processors, but I can't imagine anything above a 2-3% difference, but that is just an educated guess.
