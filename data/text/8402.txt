Q: Any application that can split scanned PDF's on an iPad? Are there any iPad PDF apps that either automatically or manually can split scanned PDF's into multiple pages? 
At school, I receive many scanned PDFs that have 2 physical pages per PDF page, which makes them more cumbersome to work with since it requires me to manually pan around to see the next page.

A: PDFPen for iPad
has recently been released. It will permit you to split PDFs by saving a new copy of the PDF and then deleting pages you don't want.

A: I've not come across anything that will alter PDF's like that, however Goodreader (and Goodreader for iPad) is in my opinion the best PDF reader app
It has quite a few reading modes and easier pan and zoom controls (multitouch gestures) that may provide a better reading experience than using the iPad's built in viewer.
The downside is it is a commercial program, but at $5, it is money well spent.
