Q: How to I set the scroll direction to be "non" natural for any new users created on a Lion machine? When a new user account is created on a Lion machine, a "helpful" dialog appears to describe "Natural" scrolling.
I want to set the scrolling to be "unnatural" for any new users created - is there a defaults setting for that?

A: From a Terminal window:

sudo defaults write /System/Library/User\ Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences  com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool false
