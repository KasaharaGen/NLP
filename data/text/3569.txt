Q: How can I block specific telephone numbers on my iPhone 4? How can I block specific telephone numbers on my iPhone? I don't want to get call from specific numbers. if anyone call to me from the blocked number, he should receive a message that "this number does not exist" or "this number is busy" always.

A: If you want to block a specific number where they are given a msg, "Not Available, Blocked, etc" it is free, you DONT have to have any 'reason' except that you want them blocked. Any phone co. will do it (I'm 100% sure Verizon allows FREE blocking of up to 5 lines) I simply called Verizon n said block this #, they did, it expires after 3 months automatically, but you can simply renew it.
I'de LOVE to have an app that could simple send specific numbers straight to Vm (like iBlacklist) without jail breaking my iPhone ;(

A: Pay $20 and port your phone number to Google Voice.  Then Google can ignore calls from specific numbers.

A: There are applications that do this if you have jailbroken your iPhone.  Without jailbreaking however there isn't a way to block a single or specific incoming number.  I've known people that have requested their provider to block a certain number and without a very good (usually legal) reason, they won't do it.
The best thing you can do is record 30 seconds of silence in garage band and then use that as a ringtone for that specific number.  Then at least the phone won't alert you.

A: Why don't you record your own message and have that respond to unwanted calls. Could be fun eg :  "All calls from this number are traced by the authorities as part of an ongoing investigation."  or  "Calls from your number are subject to $100 per minute surcharge. You have 5 seconds to hang up before charges commence." 

A: The only thing you can do is call your provider and ask them to block the number for you. 
There may be apps available in the app store that can do this though.
