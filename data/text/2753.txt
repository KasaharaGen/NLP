Q: Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver I'm trying to install "Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver" and I'm getting message:
You can't open the application Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver because the Classic environment is longer supported.
What can I do in order to get it to work?

A: Look for updated drivers.
This is an app written for Mac OS 9, so there's really no way to get it to work with a computer running OS X.
