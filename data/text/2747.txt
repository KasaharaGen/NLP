Q: Printopia (AirPrint): turn it on/off via command line? I love Printopia - this allows my iDevices to print to a printer attached to my Mac. The problem is I usually don't leave it on all the time. Whenever I want to print from my phone, I'd turn it on via System Preferences app.
Question: is it possible to do so via command line? This way I can ssh in my Mac and turn it on/off (or even better, write some simple script to automate the process).

A: There's no real reason that I can think of not to leave it on all of the time, but you can easily turn it on and off by loading or unloading the launchd plist:
This will turn it on:
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist
This will turn it off:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ecamm.printopia.plist
Or you could just run the server directly:
/Library/PreferencePanes/Printopia.prefPane/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Printopia Server
(that's all one line)
