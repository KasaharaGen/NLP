Q: Why doesn't anything happen when I connect my Nexus S to a MacBook Pro 2010 using a USB cable? I've tried to connect a Nexus S to a MBP 2010 via USB. After connection, the Mac does not respond.
Anybody know why? I have tried it with a powered USB hub and get the same result: No responses for the USB storage.

A: Fire up system profiler on your mac. This can be refreshed to show all USB devices connected - even if there is a driver issue, at least you'll know if the cable and physical connection are good.

A: And finally I have found this issue is caused by a bad USB cable.
It is working when I use a HTC USB cable to connect to my MBP.  

A: You may need to download software provided by Samsung to connect your device by USB.
