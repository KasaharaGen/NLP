Q: How should I prep a laptop for a return? I'm returning a Macbook Air I purchased last week at an Apple Store (not because I don't like it, I just need a bit more screen real estate) and I want to make sure I put it in an acceptable state. I'd like to remove all the data that I've put on it in the last week but I don't want to go overboard.
Should I format the drive and return it with no OS? Format and reinstall the OS? Leave it as-is and trust Apple refurb to not look at my data?

A: If you're pressed for time, and since you mentioned the Macbook Air was new and purchased last week, it probably was installed with OS X Lion which has full-disk encryption. If this assumption is true, then

*Back up your data. I'd recommend using Time Machine (so you don't
have to re-setup your user id, install apps, etc).

*create another "throwaway" admin id, and log in to your "throwaway"
admin id

*and delete yourself from the Mac using System Preferences -> Users & Groups preference pane.


A: Wipe the disk. The apples will sure reinstall the OS.
