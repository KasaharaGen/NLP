Q: Restore MacBook AIr (mid 2011) partitions I just messed up my partions on my harddisk. 
The situation:
Installed windows 7 using bootcamp (NTFS).
After that i wanted to ceate a shared partition, on wich both MAC OS and Windows can write.
In windows 7 Disk Management i took 5 GB off the Bootcamp partion, and created a FAT32 partion from it.
Now when i boot only the windows partition is visible when i reboot (no macosx or restore) When i try to start windows it gives a short BSOD (acnt read t) and then reboots again.
I guess i should create some sort of bootable restore USB stick.
Any ideas how to get me going again ....please....

A: Hold down Command+R while booting it, and it should run Lion Recovery, either from your recovery partition if it still exists or directly over the Internet. See here for details.
