Q: How to import Apple Mail accounts? I'm copying the old Mail folder over a fresh OS install.
I Copied over ~/Library/Mail & ~/Library/Application Support/Mail
Mails and mailboxes imported all right ( even better results than using Import Mailboxes menu option )
But the accounts didn't import. Where are they stored?

A: Account data should all be in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist.

A: Newtron's advice is spot on. For some account types, you will find that you'll need to import the appropriate keychain entries as well.
