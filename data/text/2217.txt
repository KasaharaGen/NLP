Q: How can I open a new customized (color, font, etc.) Terminal window from the command line? I'd like to open a new Terminal window in Terminal.app. I'd also like to be able to customize this window (color, text, etc.), based on one of my pre-defined defaults, or based on something else not yet set in Terminal preferences.

A: *

*CMD+n opens a new terminal window.

*CMD+t opens a new terminal tab.

*If you want to open something other than the default Terminal, use the techniques here to open a pre-defined Terminal setup. You can also do CMD+n,i,Tab to bring up the Inspector, then use up/down arrows, or type the names, which lets you choose a pre-defined Terminal.

*If you want a setup hard-coded and not yet known to Terminal.app, follow these instructions.
