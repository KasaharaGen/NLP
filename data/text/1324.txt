Q: Automatically open mounted volumes in Path Finder I may just be missing some simple setting, but if I mount a volume in Path Finder, it never switches to show me the contents of the volume.  I have to manually click the volume in the sidebar.  Is there a way to have it immediately switch to that volume after I mount it?

A: Not switching but show in a new window.
Preferences->Browser->Open mounted volumes in new Window
