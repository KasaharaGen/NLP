Q: Adding "Lookup in the dictionary" in the pop-up list in Firefox? Is it possible to add the item "Look up in Dictionary" in the right-click popup menu when you have selected a word on a web page, in Firefox (just like it is available in safari) ?


A: There is a firefox addon to add this in the context menu: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/look-up-in-dictionary-7261/

A: As of now (Dec 1 2014), although the option is not present in right-click menu, three-finger dictionary lookup works perfectly fine in my Firefox (Developer Edition 35)
