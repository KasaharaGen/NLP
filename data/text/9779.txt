Q: How can I unlock single-user mode? I stupidly forgot the password to my MacbookPro. I have locked single user mode 2 weeks ago (for security reasons). How can I unlock single-user mode to get my password back?
Thanks guys :D

A: There is a way to geting if you follow this link to the Apple website where you will find information on resetting the administrators account password. 
You will require a Mac OS install disc as close to the OS you are using as possible
