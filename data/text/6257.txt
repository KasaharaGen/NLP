Q: After Lion installation, Safari occasional unresponsive, won't take input Since installing Lion, I've had Safari 5.1 become unresponsive to input several times on two different machines (both iMacs, in different locations). 
I don't see anything in the forums I quickly checked. Any ideas?
(Safari becomes responsive again after quitting and restarting. Input device -- mouse, trackpad -- makes no difference.)

A: Try completely clearing out Safari of junk.
First, empty the cache by hitting Safari > Empty Cache....

Click Empty.

Then completely reset Safari by hitting Safari > Reset Safari.

Check all the checks and hit Reset.

Then quit and relaunch Safari. That should speed things up.
If not, you can always use another browser. ^cough^Chrome^cough^

A: Has nothing to do with resetting anything or emptying any cache. Ignorance of mouse clicks is a Mac OS X 10.7 bug which seems to occur on older Macs and should be addressed by Apple.
