Q: software for autoslicing a song I'm searching a program for slicing a song (MP3, wav, whatever) automatically in different patterns.

A: I hope I understand correctly, you are trying to edit a song, perhaps for a ringtone or something ? 
You could try Garageband that ships with your Mac,
Or you could try this Program, Audacity, I find it very useful.
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
Hope it helps
