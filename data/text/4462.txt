Q: How do I change the OS X Mouse Pointer's color? I have some visual impairment, and I often have problems finding my mouse pointer on the screen.  I want to change the color of the pointer.
I know in "Universal Access" you can change the size, but it still doesn't help that the cursor 'blends in' with everything else on my screen.  I want to make my cursor bright green or red.
I'm using OS X 10.6.7.

A: Anything that allows you to change the color is paid software. Here's MightyMouse.
Unfortunately, it looks like MightyMouse has been discontinued :(
I would recommend this free software that displays a circle around your cursor. When you haven't moved your mouse for awhile and you move it, it'll display a circle around the pointer. Here's the software.

A: I think this application may help you:

A: Try Omnidazzle you can not change the color, like I want to but you can see a thing round the mouse to find it by pressing a key. Try it.
