Q: What car stereos work well with iPhone Bluetooth A2DP Streaming Audio The iPhone 3G supports Bluetooth stereo (A2DP) but lacks any volume control.  As a result, my JVC stereo with the KS-BTA200 Bluetooth adapter clipped stereo audio so horribly that I ended up removing the adapter and foregoing the Bluetooth hands free capabilities.  Now, I just use my AUX jack for music and a separate Bluetooth speaker phone (as long as it doesn't do A2DP).
Has anyone been able to get acceptable (not clipped) Bluetooth Stereo Audio from their iPhone to any car stereo?  What models work well?

A: I bought my wife a Sony Xplod (sorry, forgot the model number) and that works really well with our phones. I would assume that all Sonys work equally as well (if not better).
