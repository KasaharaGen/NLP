Q: Photo Taking Application with Jokes I plan to get an iPhone, one of the tricks I can think of is to use it to play a joke on my friends.
This is how the joke goes. I would ask my friend to pose for me in the name of testing the quality of the camera. As I snap his/her photos, instead of showing his/her real face, I want the snapshot to be replaced with a picture of a pig (say), or anything that would elicit laughter.
Is there such an app available? 

A: Uff, there are a “lot” of photo + fun applications in the App Store. Here’s a few I’ve tried:


*

*Face Substitution

*Swap Faces: Very funny (has a Lite version)

*Face It: Allows you to add overlays of things (glasses, mustaches, etc)

*Face Melter: allows you to deform a face (it makes you laugh a lot to be honest)


I have performed a “Face” search in the AppStore for iPhone apps and there are quite a lot, I suggest you take a look at those.
