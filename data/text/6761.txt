Q: Speed up Mission Control Preview Animation Once in Mission Control, I like to able to preview the contents of each the Desktops in the larger preview section instead of only relying on the thumbnail view.  You can accomplish this by entering Mission control and then hittingCTRL+Shift+left/right arrow.  
However, the animation for switching between desktops in the main preview screen is so slow that it because unbearably useless for as fast as I like to work.  Is there a way to actually speed that animation up?

A: Not sure why you're using ctrl-shift to do this. This exits Mission Control, but selects the desktop you clicked on. The reason the animation is so slow is that you're held shift (which slows down many OS X animations). Holding ctrl does nothing.
I think what you want to do is switch the preview area of Mission Control to show the contents of another desktop.
This is accomplished by option clicking on the Desktop you want to preview.

A: I'm not sure what you are doing with the CNTRL + Shift, on its own it does nothing for me, if I click a space it exits Mission Control to that space, slowly. Shift generally slows down OSX animations (for example hold down Shift and minimize a window). I use CNTRL + left or right arrows to move back and forth between previews. Well, mostly I use a three fingered swipe. Both of those are fast. 
You can enable the CNTRL + arrow shortcuts in Keyboard Preferences under the MissionControl section of the  Keyboard Shortcuts tab.
