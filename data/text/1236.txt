Q: How do I enable the Java console in Firefox? I'm using MacOSX 10.5.8 and the default Java provided by Apple (e.g. /usr/bin/java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java). My web browser is Firefox 3.6.12.
I'd like to view the Java console to debug some Java applets which I access with Firefox.
How can I enable the Java console?

A: This is not done via any Firefox configuration option, but an account wide Java setting:
Open the Java Preferences utility which you can find in Applications -> Utilities. 
There, under the Advanced tab, and "Java console", choose "Show console".
