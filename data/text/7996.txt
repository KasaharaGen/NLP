Q: Simplest way to prevent iTunes from automatically launching when iPhone/iPad is connected When I connect my iPad or iPhone to my Mac iTunes automatically launches. What is the simplest way to prevent this from happening?

A: If you are using Apple's iTunes on Windows 8 or Windows 10, you can disable iTunesHelper by executing the following instructions:

*

*Right click the task bar


*Select the Task Manager



*Click the Startup tab


*Click the iTunesHelper app


*Click the Disable button


*Close the Task Manager

You can also right-click the iTunesHelper app and select Disable from the context menu.

A: For all those who never use iTunes and do not have that 'Summary' panel (not sure why this happens, perhaps iTunes version too old)
I just disabled execution for iTunes altogether.
So, open terminal and sudo chmod -x /Applications/iTunes.app/ - never see iTunes again.

A: iTunes Helper is no longer shown as a login item, so the technique of removing this to keep iTunes away no longer works. However, there is an ignore-devices configuration value to tell the helper to stop launching iTunes when a device is attached.
Set this option like so (seems to take effect immediately):
defaults write com.apple.iTunesHelper ignore-devices 1

This allows you to keep auto sync enabled in iTunes (so it will sync when you decide to launch it manually), while also keeping iTunes from still popping up when your device has a software update available.

A: Unfortunately, the option mentioned in the other answers is no longer present on iTunes. Instead, the OSX solution is now similar to the Windows one:


*

*Open System Preferences

*Select Users & Groups

*Select your user profile if not selected already

*Go into the Login items tab

*Select and remove iTunes Helper from the list

*Log out and back in, or restart OSX


A: The simplest way is to un-tick the Automatically sync this... box* on the Summary Screen for the device in iTunes when the device is connected:



*

*This is per device.


Alternatively you can just remove the iTunesHelper service under your Login Items which will disable it irrelevant of the tick box state.

A: From the iTunes menu at the top go to iTunes>Preferences>Devices>Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically. Check the box at the bottom of that window. Click OK, quit iTunes.
That will stop iTunes from launching when you connect the phone stop automatic syncing.

A: If you NEVER use iTunes and simply want to charge your devices without seeing the annoying pop-up every time, you can simply rename the iTunes app.
Solution for Mac:


*

*Make sure your iTunes app is off.

*Open Terminal and enter:

cd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS && sudo mv iTunes iTunes_off


*Enter your admin password and you should be all set.
UNDO
If you need to UNDO this later, all you need to do is rename it back, i.e.:

cd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS && sudo mv iTunes_off iTunes

P.S. This is a similar to @YemSalat solution from Jun 1 '16 (+1), except for this one is a bit more obvious if you come back 6 months later.
P.P.S. If you update iTunes it may restore the original functionality.

A: *

*Connect the iPhone/iPad/iPod device to the computer

*Inside iTunes, click on the device and then click on the ‘Summary’ tab

*Scroll to the bottom of the Summary tab selections until you see “Options”

*Click on the checkbox next to ‘Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected’ – wording will be slightly different if your device is an iPad or iPod or whatever

*Close iTunes


A: Here is one additional hint to prevent any system app from launch on iPhone/iPad/Camera connection:


*

*Launch app "Image Capture" by typing its name in Spotlight by Ctrl+Space



*In bottom left corner use combo box to select "No application"
