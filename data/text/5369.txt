Q: Can anyone confirm whether MacRuby framework shipped with Lion? Somewhere I read that Apple wants to include macruby framework in OS X Lion. 
Did they include it? 

A: Macruby is there as a private framework, and you can call it as such using code. For more elaboration, you should ask your question again on Stackoverflow.
