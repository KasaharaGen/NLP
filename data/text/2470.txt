Q: What's the most complete calendar app for iPhone? I (and I think many of you) would like to find an iPhone calendar app that lets the user add an new event by touching the hour (no the day-view mode) and delay an event, instead of needing to enter, edit, change the time and finally save.
Is there such an app? 

A: I'm a big fan of Calvetica, which can do the things you're looking for. And it's much prettier than the default iOS Calendar app.

A: Pocket Informant is probably the most full featured I've seen - almost too full-featured, as it can be a bit overwhelming initially.  I use it's built in Google Sync functionality to sync directly to my Google Calendars from within the app itself.
Bonus points for the fact that it actually turns the location field of an event into a map link (Still can't understand why the built-in Calendar.app doesn't do this...)
