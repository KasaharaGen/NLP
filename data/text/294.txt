Q: How can I check the model of my Apple computer? Is there a way that I check the model number of my Apple computer? (For example, iMac9,1.)

A: System Profiler
In the left corner of the top menu, pick the apple menu and select About This Mac.
In the About This Mac panel, click the More Info... button. This starts the System Profiler.
On the first page (Hardware Overview) there is a Model Identifier, which is the name you are interested in.
