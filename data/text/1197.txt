Q: Avoid iPhone lock on iPod sleep Is there a way to prevent the iPhone from locking when "Sleep iPod" is activated as a timer? 
I have this alarm clock app (SleepCycle) that needs to be running on an unlocked iPhone to pick up movement during the night. If I also want to listen to music or an audiobook while falling asleep, I set the clock timer to sleep iPod after a certain interval, but this seems to also lock the iPhone, even if I've set auto-lock to never. Any ideas?

A: Maybe you can ask the developer of SleepCycle to put some iPod scheduling controls into the app? That seems like the best solution.
I do know of one other solution, but I'm afraid it's a Jailbreak app. There's a paid app in Cydia called SBSchedule, which (when combined with the free SBSettings and SBSettings iPod toggle) can toggle the iPod off on a schedule.
