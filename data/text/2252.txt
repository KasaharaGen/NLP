Q: MacBook Air issue: Keyboard and in built mic failing The keys 9,o,l and . on the keyboard of my MacBook Air have stopped functioning all of a sudden. Instead of the intended characters, random characters from the same row as the faulty keys appear. 
Also, the built-in mic is failing.
What could be the problem?
EDIT: The keyboard and mic problem started to appear after a defective screen panel was replaced a few days ago. I wonder how that could have caused the side effects I'm experiencing.

A: Well to me that sounds like hardware failure.  I'd suggest that you just take it in to your local Apple Store or AASP; I don't see why they WOULDN'T replace the necessary parts (I don't know the MBA assembly well) if it's under warranty.
