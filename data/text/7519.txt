Q: Apple TV2 Remote not working My Apple TV2 stopped responding to the IR remote all of a sudden. The white LED would blink with every button press, but nothing would happen. I was able to pair the Apple TV's remote with my Macbook Pro, and it worked fine. My old plastic IR remote, which still works with my MBP also displayed the same behavior with the Apple TV. 
The Apple TV did respond to the iOS remote app, so that's not the problem either.

A: I only asked this question because it was bothering me all day and couldn't find an acceptable answer, so here it is:
Hold the Left/Back button and the Menu button (on the aluminum remote) for 6+ seconds.
That's it!

A: Same thing happened to me. In my case, the solution was to use a iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) and download the free Remote App.
With that App you gain control again to the AppleTV, move to the configuration menu and pair again the remote with the box. It takes a minute and everithing was back to normal.
