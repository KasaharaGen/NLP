Q: Mirror iPad 2 screen on Mac I would like to know if there is a possibility to display the iPad 2 screen on my Mac?
You know, silmilar to the Steve Jobs presentations.
Thank you for your help.

A: Not on your Mac, but you can use and HDMI or VGA cable to a separate monitor that will then mirror the iPad2 display.

A: If you can get a Mac app that can receive AirPlay streams you should be able to use AirPlay mirroring, the same way you would for an apple TV.
AirPlayer http://ericasadun.com/ftp/Macintosh/ is one example of this but it doesn't seem to work for me.

A: Reflector should fulfill your needs.

AirPlay mirror your iPhone 4S, iPad 2 or iPad 3 to any Mac running OS X 10.6+, wirelessly.


Reflector is a paid app ($14.99 for each computer), with a trial.

A: There is also AirServer ($14.99) which will allow you to do exactly what you need and much more (streaming of all kinds of content including music, movies, photos, YouTube,...)


A: Yes. If your device is jailbroken, then you can use apps like Veency to mirror. Actually there are lot of apps available in cydia.

A: You'd need a composite cable from Apple to get the input to your monitor. You might need a converter from composite to draw input.
You would need a HDMI slot to use your Mac as input AFAIK
