Q: Transfer files between bootcamp partitions I am using Snow Leopard and Windows 7 with bootcamp. I would like to be able to save some files to my OSX partition from Windows. I would also like to have files (say, photos, source code, etc) that I can manage with both partitions. Is it possible to get the two partitions to "play nice"?

A: You have a few choices:
NTFS in Mac OS X:


*

*Paragon NTFS (US$19.95)

*Tuxera NTFS for Mac (â‚¬25)

*NTFS-3G (free)


HFS+ in Windows:


*

*MacDrive (US$49.99)

*Paragon HFS for Windows (US$19.95)


There is a bundle promotion for Paragon NTFS and Paragon HFS for Windows, available here.
