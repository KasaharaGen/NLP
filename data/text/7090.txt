Q: AppleScript broken in Lion? It seems like I cannot execute AppleScripts on my Mac.
I am running OS X 10.7.1 and when I try to compile an AppleScript, even a script as simple as display dialog "Hello World!", I get a syntax error.
In the preferences for the AppleScript editor there nothing in the Default Language drop down menu on the General preferences page.
Does anybody know what might be wrong? Is it possible to reinstall just AppleScript?

A: So actually the problem has been solved by restarting my Mac with "resume" feature turned off.
