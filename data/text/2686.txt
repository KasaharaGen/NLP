Q: What part do I need for my broken iPhone 3G? One morning my iPhone 3G just showed up with a gray screen. Everywhere I looked said that I need to replace the screen.
I bought an "iPhone 3G Screen + Digitizer" off the internet but it turns out this is NOT the part I need.
I have the technical ability to replace the screen...but I have no idea what part it is that I'm looking for.  Can anyone help me figure this one out?

A: I'm not sure which part you need exactly, but one resource that has helped me repair my iPhone 3G is iFixit.com. Especially their iPhone 3G page which lists many of the iPhone's parts.
They even have a Q&A section specifically targeting iPhone 3G repair which you may find of use.
