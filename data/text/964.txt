Q: Dvorak on iOS 4.x? 
Possible Duplicate:
Dvorak on iPad? 

I want to use the Dvorak layout on my iPhone's keyboard. I've seen that there is an iKeyEx app in Cydia which offers this, but only for iOS 3.x, not iOS 4.x. Is there a Dvorak solution on iOS 4.x?
Note that I'm explicitly excluding external Bluetooth keyboards -- I want to have Dvorak on the on-screen keyboard.

A: No, there is not. iKeyEx is the only alternative keyboard software I know of, and it has not been ported to work with iOS 4.
