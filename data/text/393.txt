Q: Dvorak on iPad? Is there any way to enable Dvorak on iPad for apps like Pages or Notes?

A: Kind of a yes, no - the software keyboard can only ever be QWERTY, AZERTY, or QWERTZ. However a hardware keyboard hooked up via Bluetooth, or dock connector (or USB with the camera connector) can be set to use DVORAK:


*

*Open up Settings App

*Go to General

*Select International Keyboards

*Select your English Keyboard

*Under the Choose a Hardware Keyboard Layout you can select DVORAK.
