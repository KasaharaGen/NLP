Q: How to change how your Terminal app starts When I launch my Terminal app, it starts in a Basic mode. I'd like to do a few things:


*

*Change default to "Pro"

*Control how Terminal is started .. For example, i'd like to either use my keyboard or LaunchBar to bring first terminal as Pro, second as Ocean etc


Please advise.

A: As far as number one, in Terminal preferences, select the settings tab, select "Pro", and click the default button.

A: First make the two windows in the profiles you like using menu Shell -> New Window.  Then save them into a group with the menu Window -> Save Windows as Group ... and give the group a name.
Then in Terminal -> Preferences, go to the General tab and set the On startup, open: setting to your window group you have saved.
