Q: Is BetterTouchTool the recommended app to improve gestures? I was looking for a way to add more "gestures" for my mbp (to accesss spaces for example) and I read about BetterTouchTool which seems to work quite well.
I was just wondering if there's any other tool like that one, and if another is more recommended.

A: I personally use it, and believe me it's awesome. I'll give it 4.5/5

A: Actually there is another application out there called JiTouch. It is much better than BetterTouchTool (except for the window snapping, which it doesn't have). I would recommend JiTouch over BetterTouchTool, even though JiTouch is a $6 paid application.
