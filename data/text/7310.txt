Q: How can I obtain older versions of Xcode? How can I obtain older versions of Xcode?  
Is there a way that I can freely download a version that only requires OS X 10.6.8? So far this is all I've found on the matter; but, when I click the 'download Xcode 3' link, it simply brings up the page for downloading version 4.

A: To get a free older copy of Xcode that will run on Snow Leopard, create(register) as an Apple Developer at this web site https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/ .  You can also turn your current Apple ID into a developer ID by signing in on the link above and following the instructions.
After you create your Developer ID go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads
On the upper left side of the page search for Xcode  and just below the search box, uncheck all of the Catagories except Developer Tools (leave that checked).
You will get three pages of results, on the second page you will find Xcode in version 3 for Snow Leopard.

A: xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg is the name of the file I am downloading currently.
I registered for free as an apple developer at https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/ and then searched for 'xcode' in the downloads section. 
I am on snow leopard, btw.

A: You can download older versions of Xcode here after you've logged into the dev center.
Uncheck all of the options except "Developer Tools" in the Categories section on the left side of the page. Every version of Xcode back to version 1.0 in 2003 is available there.

A: Xcode 3 requires a version of snow leopard (10.6.8) :D. However, do you still have your snow leopard disc? if so, re-install it because xcode 3 comes pre-installed with sow leopard.

A: For what it's worth for anyone else that ends up here; the bundle linked above:

Doesn't exist anymore, but there is a way to get 3.2.6 - through developer.apple.com/downloads - after free registration filter for 'developer tools' and type xcode - you should find the xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg others have mentioned.  It's 4+ GB though... 
It's a shame you can't get it without IOS but for those of us stuck with snow leopard (despite mavericks now being free) 3.2.6 seems neccesary for brew - the package management tool.

A: Go to App Store, click Purcharsed, and check if you see 'Xcode for Snow Leopard' there. I have it there, but maybe it's because I've bought Xcode 4.0 when it was released and there was no Lion yet.

A: it's available!
