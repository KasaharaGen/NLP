Q: What brand of SSD does apple use for their LATE 2011 MacBook Pros? The ones that came out on October 2011. Models #:

MD311*/A,  MD313*/A,  MD314*/A,  MD318*/A  or MD322*/A

The SSD options are listed here with no detailed information:

Note that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9113/what-brand-of-ssd-come-optional-on-macbook-pros is NOT a duplicate question as the answer is not specific to these model #'s

A: I bought a Apple SSD which is OEMed from Toshiba.  The model is TS256C. http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/17/apple-adds-speedier-ssds-to-latest-batch-of-macbook-airs/
When installing this SSD into my later 2008 MBP, the TRIM is automatically enabled in Lion.  However, other brand SSD, you may need to manually enable the TRIM.
So I guess the later 2011 MBP may using the same OEMed Toshiba SSD.
