Q: ASM for Mac OS X I've been very interested in learning ASM for a long time now and finally decided to get to it.
The problem is I have a MacBook and most of the books teach you based on DOS/Linux or MIPS.
Do you have any good tips for starters in ASM on a Mac OS X?

A: Stackover flow has a good answer on this exact question:
