Q: Why is this dialog being displayed when I start firefox? I'm a beginner Mac OS user.
When I open Firefox I receive the dialog below, why doesn't Firefox just start? What is the point of the below dialog?


A: This isn't a dialog, this is the result of mounting (opening) the Firefox.dmg (think of it as an archive or drive image). For mac users it's obvious - you should drag the FF icon to the Applications folder shortcut (the blue folder). This will copy the Firefox application in the /Applications/ folder. Then just unmount (eject) the Firefox.dmg archive and start Firefox from Applications (like you start the rest of your applications).

A: 
The file what you downloaded, is an "DMG" archive type (like ISO image).

*When you double click on it, you open it (called mounted it).

*After opening the archive you should install the application - simple way - drag and drop into the destination.

*After the install - eject and usually can trash the dmg archive.
