Q: How much will adding an extra hard drive to my MacBook Pro affect battery performance? I have a current MacBook Pro 15" i7 2.2Ghz with a 500GB 7200RPM (default) hard drive.
I am thinking of replacing both the current hard drive and the superdrive with two Seagate Momentus Hybrid 500 GB drives and placing them in RAID0 for optimal performance.
Now, I don't think performance will be a problem, but how about battery life? Are there any examples of users who already have done similar things and noticed the effect on battery life?

A: Having a second hard drive will certainly decrease battery life by a noticeable amount. Behind the CPU and LCD, the hard drive is the largest drain on battery.
A word of caution: RAID 0 is almost never a good idea, unless you'll be doing backups constantly and don't mind being totally down if a drive fails. You'll get better performance from an SSD and you'll be able to keep your optical drive.

A: Go with an SSD. The lack of moving parts will increase battery life.
On my previous (late 2011) non-Retina MBP, I replaced the optical drive with a 512GB SSD, (The optical drive is basically useless 90% of the time - may as well use the space for SOMETHING.), and moved the operating system installations (OSX and Win7) to the SSD. This significantly improved battery life as well as overall performance.
If you don't want to pony up the cash for two large SSDs, put one SSD in along with a higher RPM spin drive. 
Also, check out the Corsair 16GB RAM upgrade available from Newegg, among other places. Takes about 10 minutes to install, doesn't void your warranty, and also really helps overall performance.

A: i wonder how well a hybrid will work in a raid0.
could there be some logic that would make the ssd portion of this hybrid useless when used as a raw raid0 drive?
i'm not sure about their logic of caching from spinning drive to the ssd portion.  but if it's by file name or structure, the raid-0'ness of it might defeat that.
just a thought
