Q: Set default input/output sound I have a mac that is hooked into a sound board, I have external sound card that interfaces between the computer and the soundboard, this works great.
However, whenever the computer restarts it sets the input & output to the 'internal microphone' and the 'built in output'.
I'd like to default to the other soundcard. How can I do this?
I'm running OS 10.6.3

A: I use SoundSource (Freeware) to set my output/inputs and they persist (I have a Firewire Audio Interface and a M-Audio Pro USB). 
What sound board do you have?
Why are you running 10.6.3 and not .4?
