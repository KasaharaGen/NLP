Q: Is it possible to send mail using Command + Enter in Mail? I can't think of any reason why Command ⌘ + Enter ↩ would not send a mail draft, instead of the current shortcut, which is Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ + D Is there a way to change this?

A: You can look at this answer and apply accordingly to your case.
TL;DR version:


A: I tried to use the System Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts tab to define Command+Return to send a mail.  But the effect was that Command+Shift+Return sends mail.

A: I found a solution in Mathias's dotfiles. In a Terminal window, type:
defaults write com.apple.mail NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Send" "@\U21a9"

Then restart Mail.app
