Q: OS X Downloaded File Warning Example at bottom.
How does OS X apply this warning and what's the best way to disable it? 
I'm a Web Developer and more than understand the risks of teh interwebs.


A: Use the Terminal and this command:
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO

That will disable warnings completely after you restart the system. To reverse it, run it again with "YES" instead of "NO".
Or you can create a custom listing of safe files with the method described here:
Custom assessment file for downloaded files
