Q: Finder does not show Path Bar and Status Bar, what to do? I have OS X Lion and when I open a finder window everything seems OK.
But I can't see the Path Bar nor the Status bar.
When I activate one of the bars with View->Show Status Bar or View->Show Path Bar the Finder window gets bigger in height ( growing downwards ), nothing else happens.
Anyone have an idea what I can do to see the Bars?
(The Bars are working in other applications like Safari, âŒ˜+/ and it pops up)

A: Is it just this you are looking for? Finder > View > Show Path Bar?

A: The bug did come from BetterSnapTool. An app for resizing the windows.

A: Remove the Finder plist. You can find it at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.
Then restart. This should reset any strange preferences keeping the Finder from showing the path and status bars.
