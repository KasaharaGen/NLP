Q: Icon for iWeb published site? How can I use a favicon for my website that is published using iWeb?

A: Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to create a favicon via the gui elements of iWeb. However, you are able to pretty simply add the html to the published version of your site.
I recommend following this guide from All About iWeb. It walks you through how to first create the favicon using one of a variety of free online tools and then informs you where it needs be stored in your site's structure as well as the necessary html you need to add to your pages.

A: Can you define what you mean by a "personal icon"?
Are you referring to the image shown next to the URL in the address bar? That's called a favicon.
Or do you mean an image on the web page itself that represents you/your site, such as the apple on the left-hand side of the menubar at the top of apple.com? That can be called any number of things (header graphic, home button, etc.), but it's just a normal graphic in png, jpg, or gif format.

A: This article should be just the thing.
