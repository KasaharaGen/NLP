Q: Migrating from Linux to OSX and have a few questions I've read this question and still have a few concerns.
I've been using linux for a number of years and was wondering if some of the features I have learned to rely on are present in OSX (on a Macbook Pro, if it matters).


*

*Is OSX's terminal still BASH? And if it isn't, how easy is it for me to install it on my system? 

*Will I be able to compile software (usually designed for Linux) on my mac and use it?

*How easy is it for me to dual-boot on a macbook (OSX & Linux)? Is it even possible?
