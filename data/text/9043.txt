Q: Bootcamp, Face Time HD camera image - How to "Flip Horizontal" I am using the built in Face Time HD camera (iMac Mid 2011) via Bootcamp on Windows 7. It basically works great, but I need to switch the output image horizontally. The software I am using does not provide that function. There is actually a switch in the driver pop up for "Flip Horizontal" but it is deactivated.

Is there any way to have this activated? (or are there known third party plugins that could provide the "flipping" function?)
