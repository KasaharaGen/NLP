Q: iPhone 4 does not wake up from being locked My iPhone 4 periodically does not wake up from being locked. I have to wake it by holding the home and power buttons. This is happening a lot more frequently as of late than before. It has the latest OS. It seems quite a few people have the same problem. Does anyone know a solution to this problem? None that I found on the Apple forum seems to solve it.

A: You could try going by the Apple Store to meet with a Genius (if there is one close enough to you). They have diagnostics they'll run for free to see if something weird is going on with your phone. Make an appointment online.

A: Have you tried restoring the iPhone via iTunes? You should sync the iPhone first to back up everything, then press the Restore button in the device management screen.

A: You could try to reset it: Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. There might be some corrupted preferences somewhere.
Try to sync your iPhone and look into your ~/Library/iTunes/.../Logs (sorry, can't remember the exact path and I don't have a Mac right now).
And try to find out if there's a crash file that match the time of the issue. From there you'll be able to define if it's an app running in the background or iOS-related.
If none of the above, it might be hardware-related (maybe you're holding it wrong!) and will have to send it to an Apple Store.
