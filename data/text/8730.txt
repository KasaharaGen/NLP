Q: How can I remove leading/trailing whitespace from filenames in Automator? My wife tediously renames files all the time when storing on her backup external storage, so I investigated using automator to do this for her. I now have an automator folder where she just drops the file in there and it will rename the file appropriately.
I'm now faced with a situation where the file may now contain leading and/or trailing whitespace, how might I simply trim this whitespace?
I've never really used AppleScript but am proficient in shell scripting, can I simply write a shell script that will perform this task? I will give AppleScript a go if someone could point me in the right direction.

A: There's one line script for that, cd to that folder and ...  
for f in *; do mv "$f" "$(echo $f)"; done

Put it into a shell script and call it from Applescript:
tell application "Terminal"
    do script "whatever"
end tell


A: For a correct answer that basis on that of Tuan's answer the following is needed which will not only rename the file but also preserves the action chain for following actions.
Take note also that we don't want to rename the parent folder in any way, just the files.
for f in "$@" ; do
    dirname=$(dirname "$f")
    basename=$(basename "$f")
    name=${basename%.*}
    ext=${basename##*.}
    name="$(echo "$name" | sed -Ee 's/^ +//;s/ +$//')"
    new="$dirname/$name.$ext"
    mv "$f" "$new"
    echo "$new"
done

You also don't need to put this into a shell script itself, automator can have this embedded into the action "Run Shell Script".

A: for f in "$@"; do new="$(echo -n "$f" | sed -E 's|/$||;s| +$||;s|^ +||;s|/ +([^/]+$)|/\1|;s| +(\.[^.][a-zA-Z0-9.]*)$|\1|g')"; mv "$f" "$new"; echo "$new"; done
(Paste as a Run Shell Script action and select Pass input: as arguments.)

A: I was also looking to remove trailing whitespace from file and folder names. This Super User post helped me out. 

A: There's an AppleScript (very similar to Automator) that trims file names. It's a bit long, so I can't post it here, but here is a link to the code. Make sure you read the beginning part of the code, as it explains what the script does and how it works.
