Q: How do I connect an internal SATA drive to Mini-SAS? I have a SATA III SSD which I would like to connect to an ATTO technologies' SATA II card in my Mac Pro. The SSD uses the typical internal SATA interface while the ATTO card uses Mini-SAS both internally and externally.
What do I need to plug the SSD into the ATTO card? I'm assuming internal/external doesn't matter, and that I'd get the same speeds either way, correct?

A: This is the proper cable:
