Q: How can I improve/replace View Source in Safari? As a new convert to Safari, I am astonished by how unbearably ugly default page source view is.
The font is miserably small and unaliased, leave alone color highlighting.

Is there a way to enhance Safari's View Source feature or seamlessly replace it?
I'm looking for:


*

*reasonable default font, customizable is better;

*basic HTML/JS syntax highlighting;

*working on Lion.


Please refrain from suggesting viewing source with Web Inspector: it is nice but isn't convenient for quick source browsing.

A: Take a look at this Safari extension:


BetterSource Safari 5 Extension
BetterSource shows the document source in a new tab, with line numbers, and colour syntax highlighting.


A: You need to go to System Preferences - General and at the bottom set the minimum font size for antialiasing to 4 pixels. That way you'll get antialiasing for small fonts.
(I never understood why they have to let you select that - under 8px fonts are just not readable without antialiasing)

A: If you go to Safari's preferences > Advanced and set "Never use font sizes smaller than" to 11, it should fix the anti aliasing problem.
For color highlighting you can use a SIMBL plugin called Safari Source that will do that for you.
UPDATE: Actually, in the Safari Source settings page (Safari>Preferences>Safari Source) you can set the font size for the view source page. So set it to anything above 11 and it'll antialias.

A: BetterSource

It's similar to the view source in Chrome in a lot of ways:


*

*It has syntax highlighting and line numbers

*It's opened in a tab instead of a window

*Uses the default monospace font specified in preferences instead of Monaco 12


Limitations:


*

*Line numbers are included in selections

*The source view cannot be opened with a shortcut

*Takes slightly longer to appear than the normal source window



Setting a default zoom level in a custom style sheet
The custom style sheet you can specify in the Advanced tab of the preferences also affects the view source window. I don't know how to target it specifically, but this would apply a default zoom level to both it and website content:
body { zoom: 125%; }


view source in TextMate.scpt
tell application "Safari" to tell document 1
    repeat 100 times
        if (do JavaScript "document.readyState") is "complete" then exit repeat
        delay 0.05
    end repeat
    set src to source
    set u to URL
end tell

try
    tell application "TextMate"
        open POSIX file u
        activate
    end tell
on error
    set f to do shell script "f=`echo " & quoted form of u & " |
    sed 's|.*://||;s|/$||;s|:|-|g;s|/|-|g'`; echo \"/tmp/view-source-$f.html\""
    do shell script "/bin/echo " & quoted form of src & " > " & quoted form of f
    set f to POSIX file f
    tell application "TextMate"
        activate
        open f
    end tell
end try
