Q: Notifications sounds not affected by iPad 2 volume When turn down the volume on my iPad 2 all the way down, It still makes a sound when notifications are received.
Is there any way to globally disable notifications sounds ?

A: In Settings | General | Sounds, you can either set the sound level of the alerts, or choose that it will be affected by the Volume buttons (which is off by default).
Update
In iOS 10 (and maybe earlier versions, I'm not sure when the change happened) this setting is under Settings | Sounds and is called Change with Buttons in the Ringer and Alerts section.
