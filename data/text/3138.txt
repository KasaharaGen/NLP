Q: Simple encryption software for the Mac I am looking for an application which would allow me to encrypt either a file or a folder. Something like right click on a file/folder, select Encrypt, give it a password and ready.
Of course, it should also be able to afterwards decrypt the said file/folder.
Is there such a thing?

A: You can also have a look at the Mac GNU Privacy Guard, which brings GnuPG to Mac OS X, together with the GPGFileTool.

A: Espionage is also a paid app, but should be 'better' then Knox.

A: You could have a look at TrueCrypt. Whilst it's not a file/folder encryption solution, it creates encrypted volumes from files like the .dmg route, but it's cross platform (if you choose an appropriate file system on the encrypted volume)

A: You can do it with a .dmg.


*

*Open Disk utility

*Select New Image or File > New > Blank disk image

*Choose the name, where to put it, the size (it will be pre-allocated)

*Choose an encryption

*Leave the other settings by default

*Choose a password


Now, all you have to do when you want to access that folder, is open the .dmg file.
And it's free.
I found an app that took care of all of that in 2-3 easy steps but can't seem to find it again. You might have more luck.

A: Knox is paid app but i can really recommend it

A: I usually recommend Espionage to my clients :)
It's awesome and easy to use.
