Q: Stop notifications from a deleted app I got the app Baby Story for my iPod Touch a while ago, and then decided I didn't like it and deleted it. Part of the reason I got rid of it was because it would pop up random messages with things like, "Your baby is hungary!" The app appears to be completely deleted, and I can't find any reference to it on the iPod anywhere, but I'll still get random notifications with things like, "Your baby is sick." Is there a way, short of reformatting the iPod, to stop these messages?

A: Removing an app should disable all of the Push Notifications. Try rebooting your iPod, and making sure that iTunes did not re-install it.
Also, you can try disabling all Notifications, then -re-enabling them. 
Maybe post a screenshot of the message. You may have another app installed (mBox for example) that displays messages from apps that send emails as well. (of course this is just a far fetched scenario).

A: Try going into the "notifications" settings in your iPod's settings to see if u can the app listed there. If so then just turn off it's notification privileges.
