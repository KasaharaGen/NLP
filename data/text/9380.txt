Q: How do I insert radio buttons in Numbers for iPad? I need to insert radio buttons on a Numbers spreadsheet. I tried importing an Excel document with form radio buttons, but it did not pull through. Advice would be appreciated.

A: You can instead radio buttons by double tapping the cell you wish to enter one and then under either the '42' or '=' option you can select true/false. When you check this it will add a radio button or tick box, you can choose which one under the 'i' 
I have done this on my iPad so will edit later when I can upload a screen shot.
