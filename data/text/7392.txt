Q: How to stop downloads from being organized by date? Many moons ago I installed an application that moves downloads into a desktop folder with today's date as the title. I would like to stop this behavior.
However, I cannot remember what I did to cause this behavior.
Specs: 


*

*10.7.x

*Mac Pro.


Things I've tried:


*

*I checked System Preferences and Activity Monitor, and see nothing
obvious.   

*I made a separate test user account, and this behavior does not occur
in this account.


Any other ideas what to look for to get rid of this, would be most welcome.

A: So, the answer should be the Glims.  Either uninstall the Glims, or config the GLims not to organize the downloading into dated folder.


A: I have a two places for you to look...maybe one hits

*Look for a folder action on the downloads folder (right click on it and see if there is anything at the bottom of the list)  You may have used automator to do this

*Are you running Hazel?  Check system preferences to see if it is installed
