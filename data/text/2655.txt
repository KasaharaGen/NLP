Q: Delete all events in iCal How can I delete all events in iCal? I have a bunch of events (some reoccurring) that I want to delete. I don't want to have to manually delete/cut each event.
I tried declining the events but that just turns them gray.
I'm running OS X 10.6.6.

A: Applescript:
tell application "iCal"
   tell calendar "My Calendar" -- your calendar here
      set theEvents to every event
      repeat with current_event in theEvents           
         delete current_event
      end repeat
   end tell
end tell


A: I solved it by deleting ~/Library/Calendars as suggested in here.
