Q: How can I buy apps in the App Store without a credit card? While I'm waiting for my credit card to arrive, I still want to be able to buy some apps for my iPad!
Are there alternative ways to pay for apps, without resorting to someone else's credit card?

A: The iTunes store accepts Paypal, so if you can get money to Paypal you're all set.  I'm pretty sure Paypal has many ways to get money to them (mail them a check, give them your account number, etc.).
The trick seems to be that you have to sign up in iTunes on your Mac/PC -- the App Store on my iPod doesn't have Paypal as an option.

A: I don't know if this is applicable to your country, but in Germany, Apple sells iTunes apps cards especially for buying apps in the app store.

A: Many supermarkets and grocery stores sell pre-paid gift cards. You can purchase a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc, gift card with cash, check, etc, at these supermarkets and then use the number on the front wherever they ask for a credit card number.
(This method is actually a preferred method for the security-conscience as well. Reason: if someone gets ahold of your card number they can only take the small amount of money that you have loaded onto the card. This provides confidence for those worried about entering their card number online.)

A: Get a 3V number, this is a virtual Credit Card that can be prepaid, so you dont need to worry about running up bills, but lets you do what a credit card does.

A: Just to let you or some folks around to know. Again similar to the first answer in German AppleStore you can actually link your Apple Account with ClickandBuy where you can actually have transferred funds from your bank directly and if you also happened to have online banking with your bank (who doesn't?) you could top-up your ClickandBuy account almost instantaneously using a thing called Sofort√úbervisung. Just to clarify I do not have a credit card and I'm not planning to get one.
