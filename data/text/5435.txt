Q: Can the Google+ app be installed on an iPod Touch? I have a 3rd generation iPod touch with iOS upgraded to version 4.3.3. When installing the Google+ 1.0.1 app, it gives the message shown in the picture below.

Question: Is there a generation or iOS version of iPod touch that will allow the Google+ app to be installed?

A: Not today.
It looks like the current app asks iTunes to require GPS on iPhone. 
iPod Touch and even iPad with GPS are prevented from downloading the app directly and iTunes will not install it.
I don't know why iTunes doesn't tell you what specific devices the app will work on rather than be a little vague about "not compatible with this device".



A: It's possible to install the app using the iPhone Configuration Utility. You first need to download Google+ using iTunes, then use the Configuration Utility to add the .ipa file to your device.

A: I have the Verizon iPad 2 and it doesn't show up in my app store search at all. Installed fine on my iPhone 4
