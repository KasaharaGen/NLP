Q: How can I get a list of all iPhone pictures that are imported to iPhoto? I have used iPhoto to backup my pictures from the iPhone. How can I find all the iPhone-photos without having to click on all the pictures to view the EXIF-info?

A: You can create a smart album with a condition on the camera model (Camera model includes "iPhone").

It's even possible to select the front or rear camera by adding a condition on the aperture. See this hints for details.
I believe iPhoto '09 has this - the picture above is in iPhoto '11 and it works great there.

A: You can define a smart album and select by camera model.
