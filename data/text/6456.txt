Q: Is it possible to master a DVD with 720HD high-definition video? Just bought DVD-Creator from the App store; big disappointment. Took an uncompressed 11 minute QuickTime 720HD 6.2GB file down to a 721MB VIDEO_TS when it burned the DVD. In other words, it chucked 88% of the info and looks lousy. Unacceptable. 
I'm running Snow Leopard, so Anamorphisizer is out. myDVDEdit 1.5(55) doesn't perform as advertised in changing from iDVD's 4:3 only-output into 16:9. 
So how can I get high quality 720HD onto a DVD from Final Express 4.0.1 using OS 10.6.8? (Lion has a known incompatibility with my 2010 MBP with its NVIDIA GeFORCE GT 300M)
with advanced appreciationâ€¦
(also, tags don't exist for DVD-Creator, Anamorphisizer, NVIDIA, & myDVDEDit; would someone please consider adding them. I'll probably be dead long before I get to 300 posts)!

A: No, there is simply no way to encode HD resolution video onto a DVD. This is a common misconception. The DVD video format does not support HD resolution. DVD players cannot reproduce 720HD video.
If you want HD on a disk, that is what Blu-ray disks and Blu-ray console players are for.
There was once a format called HD-DVD, but it is no longer supported by anybody and standard DVD players will not play back an HD-DVD at the intended resolution.
720HD is 1280 x 720 pixels per frame.
The highest resolution that the DVD format can support is 720 x 480 pixels per frame for NTSC (or 720 x 576 pixels per frame for PAL), which is at best only 37.5% of the resolution of 720HD.

You can't get HD quality output to a DVD, but DVD can do much better quality output for an 11 minute clip than what you experienced.
I would suggest that you try re-encoding again with DVD-Creator, and this time pay attention to the output quality settings, since it sounds like you set up the output quality limit to maximum of 1 CD (at 721 MB output).
If you change your settings to allow output of DVD 4.2 GB (single sided DVD), you will find a massive improvement in your burned DVD video quality.
If you are still having issues with the output quality, try using the free HandBrake video encoder instead.
Hope this helps.

A: As I know the DVD disc can be created in HD quality if your dvd recorder supports that.
