Q: What is the best way to set up a shared calendar in iCal? I am looking to have a shared calendar which my partner and I can access.  I have a MobileMe account and my partner has a Google account.  We both have Macs, I have an iPhone and she has a Blackberry.
I am looking for a solution where we can create a calendar that we both have access to from iCal (and maybe iPhone / Blackberry if possible) and that we can both edit.
So far however, I have not managed to get anything to work.  The logical solution seemed to be to create a Google Calendar on my partner's account and subscribe to it on my MobileMe account but I cant get any changes I make to be pushed back to the Google calendar.

A: Make a Google Calendar, and sync it to iCal.
Directions are in this Google article.

A: The way we do this is having a MobileMe Family account, and share using that. You can, as Nathan suggests, use Google - but it's more complicated (and we ended up using MobileMe because we had accounts anyway). 
If you're happy sharing your password with your partner, then why not log into your mobileMe account using iCal on both computers and iPhones (but not Blackberrys). You can specify to only sync Calendars and any changes will be reflected over the air on all the computers or phones. 
You'll need to add the account using the Settings app -> Mail,Contacts and Calendars on your iPhone, and the Accounts tab of iCal's preferences. I'm not sure how to create an over the air calendar sync on a BlackBerry.
