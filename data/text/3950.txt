Q: iPod touch syncs to my new computer correctly - apart from my Apps. How to fix? I have a 4th generation iPod touch.
I used to sync it with my old Windows computer and everything worked fine.
I then switched to a Mac, and followed a procedure for porting my iTunes library over.
The procedure was something like: Consolidate library, export library. Copy the generated file over and iTunes Music folder to a temporary folder. Update the file paths. Import the file onto the new, and let the Mac iTunes reorganise it in its new structure.
This worked fine, except that it didn't copy my apps across. When I selected "sync with this computer" the first time I plugged in my iPod to the Mac it seemed to work, except then I noticed that it wasn't syncing any apps. Those I bought on my iPod aren't snced to my Mac, and vice-versa,
Is there any way to force my apps to sync from my iPod to my Mac? (Preferably keeping save data).
They both use the same iTunes account.
The iPod is jailbroken, in case theres a Cydia app I can use to achieve this.
EDIT: Just to clarify, the rest of the iPod data - music, videos, iBook books, etc. sync fine.

A: Try going to the App store on the iPod and purchasing a free app.  It will ask you for your App Store account credentials.  Once this works, try syncing again.   It should then move across all the apps.  Make sure that Syncing apps is ticked in iTunes too (by default it is but check anyway).
Hope that helps.

A: Try copying your iTunes data from the PC and then move it to the Mac. Then authorize the Mac with your iTunes credentials.
