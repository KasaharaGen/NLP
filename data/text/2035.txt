Q: Chrome and Firefox not remembering session I just switched to the Mac, and I installed Firefox and Chrome. For some reason, I can't get the functionality for opening the tabs and windows from the last session to work either browser.


*

*Mac OS X 10.6.6

*Firefox 3.6.13

*Chrome 8.0.552.237


I have tried making different profiles and reinstalling the browsers but nothing works.
I have looked everywhere and can't come up with a solution. Any help is appreciated.
EDIT: Safari's "Reopen All Windows from Last Session"  also doesn't restore last session windows. 
EDIT 2: I just noticed that quitting the browser (versus closing it by clicking the x button) and restarting it does resume the last session in every browser.

A: Seeing your comment, this is because when you click the X on a Mac app, you are only closing the window, not the Application itself (like it does in Windows). Therefore you were still in a 'current' session, and that session had no windows.
