Q: iTunes is sometimes "Connecting to Store" again and again iTunes is showing this "Connecting to Store" alert. I know this is caused by the cover-search when I add new songs. But sometimes it happens when starting the app, it stucks and says "Connecting to Store" again and again. Most of the time I have to close the App.
Any solutions?

A: *

*Go to iTunes → Preferences → Store.

*Uncheck Automatically download album artwork.
