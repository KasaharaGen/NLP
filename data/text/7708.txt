Q: Why does my 13" MacBook Pro have trouble running Adobe Bridge on a 27" Apple Monitor? Configuration:
13" MacBook Pro 
2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
8GB RAM 
running Lion
Video: NVIDIA GeForce9400M 256MB. 
Apple 27" LED Cinema Display
It is a nice little computer but I am having trouble running Adobe CS5 Bridge. If I have even a few applications open, Bridge will flake out and I can't navigate to new folders or I get partial display.
If I close Bridge and disconnect the monitor I can open Bridge fine on the laptop. I then plug in the monitor and can continue to work.
This seems to be rather archaic, so I am wondering if there is something wrong with the video card or is there another reason I am having trouble running Bridge? What is the solution?
I would appreciate some expert insights.
Thanks.

A: First off, make sure you've run AAM to update all components to latest:
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/OOBE/PDApp/core/Adobe Application Manager.app

What happens when you set your displays to mirror (command-F1), launch Bridge, then revert back to extended?
