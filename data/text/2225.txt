Q: How can I figure out if a Safari extension is using unreasonable memory/cpu? How can I figure out if a Safari extension is using unreasonable memory/cpu? I'm not really experiencing any unreasonable sluggishness, but I am starting to pile up on the extensions and was considering pruning the most performance draining ones just for good measure.

A: Disable the extension.  Run Safari for an hour (normal use) and note the kind of cpu/memory usages you get from it (using activity monitor or top).
Enable the extension.  Repeat.

A: You can also use Instruments and attach it to your safari instance and start from there.
