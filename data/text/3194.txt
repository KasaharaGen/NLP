Q: Is it safe to enter your credentials on eBuddy for iPhone? I'm hesitant in using it, as it asks for all your passwords for your messaging programs.
What is their privacy policy? Has anyone ever had problems with it?

A: As part of the App Store approval checks, Apple analyzes all network data for unnecessary or malicious connectivity, meaning if it's on the App Store, it's not sending your data back to the authors.

A: Give away your password?
What's their liability? ( none ) 
What's their privacy policy ( you'll never know when it gets stolen ) 
What do you get in return?  ( A chat client like adium. Adium!)

Ebuddy, bottom of that page is used as an example.
I'd say no:  Try 
Remodium 
or if you have to have that sort of service, make a throwaway acct like insecure@gmail.com or whoknowswhothisis@hotmail.com.
