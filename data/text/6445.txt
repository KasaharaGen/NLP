Q: find video codec from terminal I'm writing some shell scripts that automatically convert some video files. Except I don't want to run the conversion on files that are already h264 encoded. Is there a way I can tell via a terminal command whether a video has a certain codec?

A: This won't work for .avi files (at least it didn't for one I tried), but for .mp4 or .mov files, it should.
To list a file's codecs:
$ mdls -name kMDItemCodecs "/path/to/some/file.mp4"
kMDItemCodecs = (
    "H.264",
    AAC
)

To find files that are movies, but don't have the H.264 codec:
mdfind "kMDItemContentTypeTree == 'public.movie' && kMDItemCodecs != '*H.264*'"


A: With ffmpeg : ffmpeg -i video_file
