Q: Using Brushes (mainly dodge and burn) in Aperture 3 while in Full Screen Mode One of the reasons I went to Aperture from iPhoto was that I could easily dodge and burn my photos, which iPhoto doesn't let you do. 
I have also been enjoying the full screen mode in aperture, where I will keep the HUD up for my edits. 
While doing some edits yesterday, I noticed that the brushes control wasn't available full screen, unless I am missing something. I also couldn't find the red eye removal tool while in full screen either. 
Doing searches online was not that helpful, since brushes and full screen were new in Aperture 3, so usually doing a search like 'aperture 3 brushes full screen' usually returns results listing the new features in Aperture. 

A: In full screen mode move your mouse to the top of the screen, a toolbar will drop down which has the red eye tool. The is also a button for the inspector hud which is the same as the usual adjustment palette. Brushes work just the same.

A: In addition to Henry’s information, here’s a picture to make it more clear:
The “hidden Toolbar”

Don’t miss The Palette, it contains interesting options for these brushes:

UPDATE If you want the “Hidden Toolbar” to remain ‘pinned’ while working in full screen, simply touch this…switch onto the lock position:
