Q: OSX Lion 10.7.1 - Safari, Textedit or Stickies in separate Mission Control Desktops I have various Safari windows, TextEdit docs, and Stickies notes that relate to different things (e.g. work, home). I want to split these across two Mission Control desktops depending on what they are for. On Mission Control, I can't seem to drag these separate windows or even whole apps (collection of windows via the icon) into a desktop - the drag action works, the plus square appears, but the item then just springs back. Same for hovering it at edge of screen.
Update: these apps had "Assign to All" set - changing to "Assign to None" via Dock did the trick :-)

A: If the item you're trying to move springs back then it's most likely already on the space / desktop you're trying to move it to.
You can also try moving something to another desktop in ways other than Mission Control:


*

*Let's say you already setup two spaces, and you want something from
space one onto space two; Just drag the window of whatever it is to
the edge of the screen and hold it there until it moves over to the
other space.

*Another way you can do this is to simply open whatever application or
file you want in that particular space.


Apps are automatically assigned to the Desktop / Space where they are launched for the very first time. You change this by Control clicking the apps icon in the
   dock, and assign to None.
