Q: Can I sync an iPhone to multiple computers without erasing all the applications? I have followed advice from this website to sync my iPhone on multiple computers, but it is determined to erase my applications. I have about 50 apps on my iPhone.
If you try to untick "Sync Applications" on the Apps tab iTunes says "Are you sure you do not want to sync applications? All existing applications and their data on the iPhone will be removed."
However if I don't tick sync apps (bearing in mind my laptop is new) my computer tries to remove all the apps, because it doesn't "own" any applications.
Is there any way I can sync without deleting all my apps?

A: It is really annoying, isn't it.
One thing that works reasonably well is for you to right click on your device in iTunes after connecting it (but before syncing it) and select "Transfer my purchases". That will copy your apps to the local copy of iTunes, so if it syncs it won't wipe things out. Not for apps at least. Music and video is a whole other headache.

A: The easiest way to do this is to copy your old iTunes folder (usually located in Music/iTunes or My Music/iTunes) - depending on which version of which operating system you are sing and replace your new iTunes folder which will be in the same location on your new laptop with the older one. 
That usually solves my problems.
