Q: Why are FTP connections read-only when I use "Connect to Server..."? I'm just trying to connect to the server hosting my website through Finder, but it's always read only, even though I'm logging in with my username and password.
Obviously, I can connect with an FTP client (Fetch), and through the terminal, etc. â€“ but what's the trick to FTP-uploading with Finder?

A: From Apple Support:

You can use the Connect To Server command to connect to an FTP server in the Finder, but you will have read-only access. You cannot copy, or upload, to an FTP volume in the Finder.
