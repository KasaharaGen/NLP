Q: iPod Touch thinks it's full when it isn't I just got a refurbished iPod Touch.  I synced it to my work computer rather than my Mac at home because it is mainly for PodCasts.  It was working great, until I put my music on iTunes over a network share at home and accidentally told the iPod Touch to sync all music.
Ever since then, every time I try to sync my iPod Touch it tells me that it does not have enough space to sync all the data I am trying to sync.
The problem with that, is I'm only trying to sync about 30 total Podcasts, all of which are audio and none are longer than an hour.  
I have reset the iPod to factory settings and still get the same thing.  
In fact, I just told it (after a restore to factory settings) to sync nothing.  Literally unchecked every sync option in iTunes and it is still telling me I have too much data being synced.  
The iPod itself tells me that it has 6.5gigs of free space, but iTunes says I have 15.7 gigs of Music synced to it.  
Anyone seen this before or have any idea what I can do?

A: Uummmm....I figured it out....
under the Books tab, the "Sync Audiobooks" option was checked....but it was below the visible portion of the screen so I didn't realize it was checked until my network drive with my audio books got disconnected and on an attempted sync it said it couldn't find the files.  
OOPS!!!  I feel sheepish.
