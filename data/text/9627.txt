Q: Can I disable the Magic Mouse swipe to go back feature in Safari? I have an Apple Magic Mouse, and in Safari, when I swipe my fingers left and right on the mouse,  first the page scrolls left or right if there is a horizontal scrollbar, and then if there is no scrollbar or the scrollbar is already at the edge, then Safari will go back/forward in my history.
This is particularly annoying when I am trying to scroll left / right, and accidentally scroll too far and navigate off the page.
For example, if I'm answering / editing a question on StackOverflow which has
some really long code block example which is so wide it gets a horizontal scroll bar or the text area has a scroll bar
some really long code block example which is so wide it gets a horizontal scroll bar or the text area has a scroll bar
some really long code block example which is so wide it gets a horizontal scroll bar or the text area has a scroll bar
some really long code block example which is so wide it gets a horizontal scroll bar or the text area has a scroll bar

if I quickly swipe left / right to read the code, I often accidentally leave the page I'm on.
Can I disable the "swipe to navigate" back / forward function of Safari? I only want to use swiping to scroll, not to navigate.

A: BetterTouchTool is a free solution: it lets you set up multi-touch gestures differently between different applications. I've had no issues using it yet, although I've only been doing so for a few days and only on Lion. It has received a respectable bunch of positive mentions from places like TUAW, MacWorld, and Lifehacker, and the only less-than-great reviews I've been able to find for it seem to be along the general lines of "I wish it also brushed my teeth" and "I turned off $feature and $feature stopped working" 
Personally, it has saved my MagicMouse from the ignominy of sharing duty and mousing space with a wired Mighty Mouse. 

A: Look under "More Gestures" the "Mouse" System Preferences pane:

Set it to two fingers or disable it altogether.
