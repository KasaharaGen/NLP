Q: How do I change the name of the hard drive Right now my hard drive is called "Macintosh HD." How do I change it to something cool like "Death Killer"

A: You can rename a file or a drive by selecting it by clicking on it, pressing "return", typing the new name, and pressing "return" again to set it. There are a few restricted characters, like :, but for the most part you can name it anything you want.
