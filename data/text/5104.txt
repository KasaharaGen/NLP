Q: Is there a way I can import ReadItLater's exported html file into my Instapaper? Is there a way I can import my ReadItLater's exported html file into my Instapaper?

A: Though I don't have a tool now, I guess it can be done in couple of ways. Yes, no one click solution.


*

*Email each url to your personal instapaper id (Refer this Lifehacker article)

*Can parse your export list and use simple API from Instapaper to add the links to your account. Refer API docs

Update:
As I said earlier, it is not a one click solution but doable. As a matter of fact, I did create an extension for chrome to do this. Here is the link http://minus.com/mc3va2C
Update 2:
The source of the extension is available @ https://github.com/palaniraja/RIL2Insta 

A: No, there is no way of doing this. With those applications.
