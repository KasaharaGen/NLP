Q: Save and Restore Launchpad Layout? I've spent a lot of time arranging the apps the way I want them on my Mac and would like for them to stay that way. Is there anyway to save the current layout of Launchpad for a later restore if it gets all mixed up again? I already know about LaunchpadCleaner 2 but would rather not buy an AIR app.

A: The database it uses (a simple sql database) is located in ~/Library/Application Support/Dock. That holds all your apps and their placement.
You could back up the file (or simply use TM) so that it can be restored at a later date.
