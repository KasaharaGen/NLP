Q: How to reassign default editor for different file types from the command line? I am looking for a way to reassign default editor on OS X. For example I want to reassign all file types opened by TextEditor with TextWrangler.
Probably it has something to do with the defaults command but I do not know how to list current assignments and change them. 

A: There is a command line utility called Duti which can do this.
http://duti.sourceforge.net/
There is no easy way to do this using built-in commands.

A: You might want to take a look at this question on Super User. It's not really as easy as editing .plist file with defaults.
