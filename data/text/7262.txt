Q: Internet Sharing failing on Mac OS X Lion Server Before I upgraded to Lion Server, I was running 10.7.1
I setup Internet Sharing in the preferences
(Share from Ethernet 1 to Ethernet 2).
After the upgrade, sharing doesn't work unless I take the following steps


*

*Login

*Turn off Internet Sharing

*Turn Internet Sharing back on


So the question is can I have Internet Sharing on and running even if no one is logged in?
Thanks

A: The answer is yes.
I'm typing you this answer through an InternetSharing
connexion provided by an iMac running MacOS Lion (10.7.3) where no one is connected:
me -> MBP    ………Wi-Fi………   iMac   ………Ethernet………   Internet 
      10.6.8               10.7.3

I'm using such a connection for professionnal use
since MacOS 10.4 with no one connected (on the Mac running InternetSharing). This connection was used by 5 other Mac (10.4, 10.5,
10.6) and might be considered as a nearly professional grade network.
When you login when your InternetSharing is faulty, could you type
in a Terminal or xterm window:
ifconfig -a
ps ax | egrep '(bootp|natp)'

My first blind guess is that your main Ethernet connection was shut down
under the responsability of your Energy Saver tuning.
