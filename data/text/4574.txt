Q: What setup allows a Windows 7 client to use OS X 10.6.7 server VPN with L2TP? I'm trying to get my Windows 7 laptop to connect to my OSX server VPN via L2TP. I understand that Windows 7 has some issues with NAT-T and I was wondering if anyone has a fix for this. Or has gotten this combo to work. 

A: Kind of annoying but fairly painless to resolve with a small edit to the registry on windows 7: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926179/
