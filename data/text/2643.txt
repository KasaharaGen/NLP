Q: Can I use my iPad to organize photos that are stored externally?  I would like to organize my photos with iPad (remove, edit, create albums etc).
I have the synology NAS and I can run the Photo app on the NAS (server) and I can use the DS Photo+ app on iPad (client) but this app can be used only as a viewer (I can't organize photos).
I also have the Aperture on the Mac and I can use the iTunes to sync the photos to the iPad but it is the same problem as with the NAS. I can't delete the photos or organize them in any way - it is only a viewer.
I have around 100k photos and I have to keep them externally. Thus, I have to use the iPad only as a remote viewer (client). I don't want to use any web related service for that like flickr, picasa etc.
It is not a problem for me to download photos from the camera to the iPad and then organize them and finally move them to the NAS.
Any ideas how can I do that?

A: Have you looked at Cinq Photo? Not sure it has everything you are looking for but thought it might be a good start

A: Pixelsync offers rating and flagging of your Aperture library on the iPad:

It has some bugs but it looks such a promising app though.

A: I think you can not do this.. the only possibility to use some remote client like flickr or even dropbox.
