Q: Many programs notify me that "grep/sed/uname/... not found"; some run, some don't. My system(?) path is damaged, how do I go about a diagnosing it? Some manifestations of this problem: macports won't install, MATLAB won't run, BTT works but incessantly spams me with " not found" popups, and emacs shell does not work.
My interactive shell PATH is fine, so this is my '/etc/paths' file:
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/Users/sambo/bin
where that last one is my own personal scripts. Could I have damaged it just from appending? Anyways, that's problem and help would be appreciated.
EDIT: With echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}, I get
/Users/sambo/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin
/Users/sambo/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@global/bin

*is it OK for these ruby bins to be upstream of the system bins?

*could that junk cause any trouble?


A: Your question is unclear as it seems to ask several things. However the issue re launching from the Dock can be answered.
The Dock does not call a shell. .profile and other startup scripts are only run when Terminal.app or similar starts a shell or you run a shell script via launchd etc.
To change the path used for Apps launched from the Dock, Finder or other GUI then you need to change the path your Workspace uses this is in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist 
e.g. mine is
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>WAFDIR</key>
  <string>/Users/mark/src/third_party/git-svn/waf</string>

  <key>PATH</key>
  <string>/Users/mark/bin:/Users/mark/env/bin:/Users/mark/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/libexec/binutils:</string>
</dict>
</plist>

Also have a look at this question.
