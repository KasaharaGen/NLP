Q: iPhone Application Name Already Taken I have developed an application for which I had registered a name on apple itunes portal. As my application is done now and I needed to upload the binary, I got invalid binary error many times. I thought I should start over the process to create the app again. I deleted the app and tried to create it again with the same name. Now it gives me error when I try to create the app with the same name.


A: You have to contact iTunes Connect, they'll have it already in their system that your app took the name first, but as you've tried to recreate it with the same name the system is assuming the other is valid (but with errors) and bouncing you. There's a support email address for them, they'll either be able to pull the old one and let you take the spot, or advise you on what you need to do.

A: After calling Apple, their rep said, this is a kind of scenario where you have lost the name. You can not reuse the name any more. I ended up using a new name appending "s" to it.
