Q: What are the storage locations of the various types of Automator workflows The purpose of this question is to create a reference for the various default storage locations where Automator stores the files it creates and saves. 
I've found a few from searching, but have yet to see a quick reference listing the possible storage locations for all the Automator workflow types. On OS X 10.6.8 with Automator 2.1.1 they are:


*

*Workflow

*Application

*Service

*Folder Action

*Print Plugin

*iCal Alarm

*Image Capture Plugin


Can anyone provide a list? (If you have lists for other OS/Automator versions, that would be a nice addition to the reference as well.)

A: Tested this on 10.7.1, Automator 2.2.


*

*Workflow - for me this defaults to ~/Documents, but these can be saved anywhere you like.

*Application - same as above. When saving a workflow/application for the first time, it even lets you change the type in the save dialog.

*Services - ~/Library/Services

*Folder Action - The actual workflow is saved in ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions. When creating the folder action, it asks for a folder to 'attach' to in the dropdown at the top. The actions will apply to the folder you choose here. 

*Print Plugin - ~/Library/PDF Services

*iCal Alarm - ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/iCal

*Image Capture Plugin - ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Image Capture
Easy way to find this out in case you forget - after creating/saving one of the types that doesn't prompt you right away for a save location, right click the proxy icon in the title bar to see the path:
