Q: Best OS X TODO app that can be synced with Android? Which is the best OS X "TO DO"-app that I can sync my Android device with?

A: I recommend Wunderlist. It has apps for Mac OSX, Windows, iPhone, iPad and yes Android. It can sync all between these different platforms. By the way it's free.

A: Try out Evernote. It is free. I am pretty sure it can sync between Android and Mac. I cannot test it myself - I do not have an Android device.

A: Try iCloud Calendar and Reminder sync I developed it.Trusted with more than 200k downloads.
