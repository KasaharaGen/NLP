Q: Issues with Bootcamp trying to boot to a bootable device other than my HD A week ago, I attempting to load Windows (with Boot Camp) on my Mac Pro. The Windows 7 install CD I used had missing files, and thus I deleted the partition I created to house windows, not wanting to waste space on my hard drive. Eventually, I decided to to use bootcamp, and now, whenever I start my computer, there is a message that states: "No bootable device, insert boot disk and press any key", or something similar. Of course, I can hold alt/option or X at startup, but I don't want to have to do that every time I start up my computer, because normally I forget. Do you have any suggestions on how to stop this phenomena from occurring every time that I start my computer? (Note that I am looking for solutions - I understand why this is occurring)

A: It seems you are booting directly to your Boot Camp partition, showing you the No bootable device, insert boot disk and press any key message (probably due to the BIOS emulation)
To fix this, go to System Preferences and select Startup Disk. Select the appropriate disk and restart.
