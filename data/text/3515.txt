Q: Media controls in chrome for Mac Now Spotify is useless I've shifted Grooveshark, however there's a distinct lack of being able to use the media controls at the top of the keyboard to control it.
Is there an extension or (non-web)app to enable this? Grooveshark responds to space, ctrl+arrow, for play and skip to next/prev track, but only when focused. I'd like to remap these to the media controls, and if possible not have to have focus on Chrome and the grooveshark tab.

A: If you use the desktop client for OS X grooveshark says they have enabled keyboard shortcuts:

But if you want to use the web player, it looks like it might be a lost unless you use Firefox for which there is an addon named keySharky:
