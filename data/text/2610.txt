Q: What models of Core i7 are available in the MacBook Pro The currentprevious 17" MacBook Pro has three CPU options:


*

*2.53GHz Intel Core i5 [Subtract $360.00]

*2.66GHz Intel Core i7 [Subtract $180.00]

*2.8GHz Intel Core i7 


Does anyone know what the exact CPU model names are, and which of them have 4 cores?
I can't find additional details anywhere.
The speeds are higher than Dell's options, leading me to believe that they're all 2-core.

A: The specs are available at this page.
The 2.53 i5 is the I5-540M (2
   physical / 4 virtual cores, and Turbo
   Boost overclocking).
The 2.66 i7 is
   the I7-620M (2 physical / 4
   virtual, and Turbo Boost).The 2.80 i7
   is the I7-640M (2 physical / 4
   virtual, Turbo Boost).

A: It appears that the new (as of February 24th) 17" MacBook Pro offers a choice between the following two:


*

*Core i7-2720QM (2.2 GHz)

*Core i7-2820QM (2.3 GHz)


(Gleaned from comparison's between Apple's marketing and Wikipedia)

A: UPDATED
New MacBook Pros were announced today, Feb 24.
Now, the 17" has the following options:
2.2 Quad Core i7
2.3 Quad Core i7
I will update with more info as soon as the Apple Online Store reopens and/or EveryMac updates.
