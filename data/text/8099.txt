Q: How do I enable Find My Mac in a Macbook Pro (Mid 2009) running OS X 10.7.2? After updating my system to Mac OS X 10.7.2 I was able to activate all features of iCloud, except for Find My Mac that stays greyed. It says "Recovery partition required".
I have a Macbook Pro, Middle 2009 model, and it was updated from Leopard to Snow Leopard to Lion.
Searching Apple's support website I could find articles on how to create the Recovery HD in an external drive, but I can't find how to create the partition in the internal drive. I have enough free space to repartition, and I have already created a 1 GB partition at the end of the free space (Apple recommends 1GB when creating the partition in an external drive).
I understand the Recovery HD is necessary for Filevault 2 too, so there must be a way of creating it after installation, but I can't find how. Anyone knows how to do that?

A: Here's a way to manually create the Recovery HD partition, but it seems complicated for a novice user.
If you don't feel sure about your self into doing this, then I suggest you to re-install Lion.
