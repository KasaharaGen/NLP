Q: What are some ways to work with / search flagged emails on iOS? The Mail App on iOS 5 adds support for flagging emails, but I can't seem to find a way to actually put this feature to use.
Is there a way to search for flagged emails?
Is there a way to cleverly auto-filter flagged emails into a folder?
I know that using GMail as an IMAP server automatically duplicates flagged messages in the "Starred" folder - but if you are using another email service, is there any way to make flags useful on iOS?

A: In iOS there's very little you can actually do with the flags except for visual cues.
On the Mac however, you can filter flagged email into a Smart Mailbox which will keep a live view of your mail matching search criteria, such as mail flags.

A: In iOS5 there is no way to easily find flagged emails.
But in the public preview of iOS 6 at WWDC (hence not under NDA), Apple showed off a new "Flagged" top level folder in the iOS Mail App, as well as a special folder for email from senders marked as VIP's.
So it appears that the ultimate answer to this questions is: upgrade to iOS 6.
