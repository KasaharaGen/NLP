Q: iPhone app to point me back to a waypoint (like a computer game) I'm looking for an app which I can use to find my camper in the desert after going for a walk, or find the b&b i left my bags in after exploring a new city. I'm hoping for something really simple which just points in the right direction and perhaps tells me a distance, like your next target on a computer game. I'm imagining opening a compass and clicking a button to record a place then having a needle pointing north and another arrow point back to the waypoint.
Does this exist?

A: Motion-X GPS Lite is free, and lets you set waypoints and navigate back to them.  Reviewed here.

A: Beacon does exactly this and is free.
