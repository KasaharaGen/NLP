Q: Shortcuts for # and $ not working on Turkish keyboard layout My keyboard layout is "Turkish QWERTY PC" and the problem is that I cannot type the special symbols being typed by using ⌥+3 and ⌥+4 which are "#" and "$".
I opened the key viewer and typed ⌥+3. It then says that I typed "#" but that's wrong.
Is there any solution to fix this? 
I am using a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.8.

A: A brief look around and it seems as though an third party application like Ukelele should help you map keys correctly for your keyboard.

A: Try using right-side ⌥+4.

A: The most common cause for a key or two not working is that they have been set as triggers for speech recognition or text to speech.  Double check system preferences/speech to make sure this is not the case with your machine.
