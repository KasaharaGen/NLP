Q: iPad 2 Wifi + 3G With iOS 4.3.3 has no multitasking gestures? I recently bought an iPad 2 Wifi + 3G. It is not Jail broken and it is completely genuine. It has iOS 4.3.3 pre-installed. I have not updated my iOS yet as I have just bought it today.
I didn't find any option like "Enable Multitasking Gestures" under the General tab of Settings.
Has Apple disabled it in iOS 4.3 now? Or is something wrong with my iPad?
Thanks

A: Most likely you used that iPad for development, when you connect it to XCode, and set it "Use for development" the Enable gestures switch will appear.

A: iOS 5 Feature
I think your thinking of the neat three-finger swipe that can be used to switch between apps on the iPad?  This is actually a demoed feature of iOS 5, which has not yet been released to the general public.  Check for the software update in September when iOS 5 is released. :)
You can learn more about the features of iOS 5 of Apple's features page. http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html

A: They did disable this feature in 4.3.3 but it worked on 4.3 I think. It will come back again in iOS 5.
