Q: Forcing bluetooth for iPhone incoming calls Is there anyway to force the iPhone to always use Bluetooth for incoming calls? - I'm on a motorcycle and have my iPhone set to auto answer calls, problem is it answers with the built in iPhone headphone/microphone instead of the paired and connected bluetooth headset.
I also cannot answer with the button on the bluetooth headset as it is inside my helmet.
Any ideas? - My iPhone is jailbroken if that helps.

A: There's no way to do this via the iPhone itself, but there are voice-controlled Bluetooth headsets (such as the BlueAnt Q2) that would allow you to take the call on the headset without pushing a button.

A: Don't know if you still want a solution for this, but Cardo makes in-helmet bluetooth receivers that are awesome. The send/receive button is on the outside of the helmet then you install the mic/speaker inside (simple process).

A: You can set the phone to use the headset or speaker by default under the accessibility options.
