Q: What am I going to do with an iMac 27 inch's display 3, 4 years from now? I want to buy a 27 inch iMac, but the monitor cannot be re-used... it cannot be hooked up to any KVM (Keyboard / Video / Mouse) switch to be used with a PC too...
Also, 3, 4 years down the road, I know the iMac will become slow and probably need to buy another computer.  At that time, what am I going to do with the monitor?  Apple is saying they save the "microwatt" between your typing, but what about wasting a good monitor like that?

A: Sell it. Used Macs hold their resale value better, in my experience, than used PCs do. (Also, keep the original box & other packaging - that will help the resale value.)

A: The display port on the latest iMac's (actually since late 2009) acts as both an output (for an external display) or an input (to make the imac screen a monitor).
