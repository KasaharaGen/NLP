Q: Is it possible to upgrade my MacBook Pro RAM and Hard Drive? I bought Macbook Pro 15 inch laptop last year with 4 GB RAM and 300 GB Hard disk, Now I feel like upgrading its RAM to 8 GB and 1 TB hard disk. I want to know is it possible to do that or not.
My system configuration is as follows:

By looking up the above config, what is the max amount of RAM and hard drive can I upgrade to?
Thanks.

A: Regarding upgrades, as per this answer to a related question, OWC is a reliable resource. Here are their pages on memory - it looks like 16 GB (2 x 8GB modules) will be your max RAM.
Similarly, here's info on hard-drive upgrades. It looks like 1TB is going to be your maximum, though as far as I know that's merely a limitation to what sizes are available in the 2.5-inch form factor that the MacBook Pro (and almost every other laptop in existence) uses. If and when larger 2.5-inch drives are released, an MBP should be able to use one.
