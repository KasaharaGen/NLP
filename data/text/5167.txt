Q: Why does the fan come on after having my MacBook Air on for only 2 minutes? Running Windows 7 and after a resume the fan comes on about 2 minutes and doesn't turn off and it's the loudest thing in the room. I'm not doing anything but browsing . . and I don't think it's because of flash. Any ideas?

A: Windows (in Boot Camp) doesn't do most of the power management tricks OS X does, so the CPU generally runs at full tilt all the time. That creates lots of heat, so your fans stay on. It may be because of flash, but, like you, I doubt it. To test that, leave Windows running for awhile with no web browsing.
