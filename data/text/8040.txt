Q: "This Apple ID is valid but is not an iCloud account" Trying to sign into iCloud on my Macbook and I get this error message. I've also had some trouble signing into the same account with iCloud on iPad and iPhone, but the messages there are even more vague.
My Apple ID is a gmail address - not anything from iTools/Mobile Me and existed as an Apple ID before iCloud was released. 

A: Go into System Preferences » Users and Groups » and then under your name on your login it says Apple ID. Put your details in there and that should sort out your problem. Well, at least it did for me.

A: A little late to respond, but on Catalina I had the same problem and resolved by opening the app store, signing in there, and then enabling 2-factor authentication in system preferences. Shortly after I was able to successfully login to icloud as well.

A: Open iCloud preferences, check box for "Mail" and register new ID which must ends with @me.com.
your iCloud id must be different than your @gmail.com Apple ID. I have same settings and everything works well.

A: Oddly enough, putting in the Apple ID under System Preferences, Users and Groups did the job for me as well. I did receive an incomplete operation error the first time I tried (you'll see a yellow cautionary triangle if you have the same problem). I simply had to enter it again. Once the ID and Password was accepted I went to iCloud and was able to proceed. Now I have to upgrade iPhoto... one problem at a time ;).

A: At first, you should be sure your account is not webonly format. If your account is in web only format. You should sign-in with your account from an apple device, for example iphone. For more information please refer to below link.
