Q: Using the Apple Battery Charger with non-Apple batteries The Apple Battery Charger's product description page states:

The Apple Battery Charger can recharge one or two batteries at a time. It's optimized for Apple-supplied batteries and it works with AA NiMH batteries from other companies, too.

Does anyone know the required specifications for using non-Apple batteries? 
The Apple supplied batteries are AA Ni-MH Min. 1900 mAh 1.2V HR6.
I have some Powerex AA Ni-MH Min. 2500 mAh 1.2V, so I'm wondering if they are compatible. I'm also curious what other non-Apple batteries are compatible.

A: Apple Batteries are Rebranded Sanyo Batteries
According to engadget, the Apple supplied batteries are actually Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG, so it appears that's one option for buying additional batteries to use with the Apple Battery Charger.
Powerex Batteries Don't Work
According to the Apple Battery Charger Manual,

  
*
  
*Flashing Amber: May indicate any of the following conditions:
  
*
  
*The batteries havenâ€™t been properly installed in the charger.
  
*An unsupported type of battery is in the charger.
  
*The batteries may be faulty or damaged and should be replaced.
  
  

With that information, I tried charging the Powerex 2500 and 2700 batteries but received a flashing amber light.
Looks like I need to buy some of the Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTG batteries.

A: I too had original apple batteries and the orange light was flashing.  I took carefully reinserted (rotated and cleaned the bottom and top of the leads) them and they seem to be charging now.  

A: And in my case, cleaning the terminals on the Apple charger made all the difference
