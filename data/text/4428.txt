Q: Cannot view Outlook invitations in Gmail web on my iPhone I have email through Google Apps that I access from my iPhone via the web.  I can view all emails and do everything I need to do except view invites sent from others using Outlook.  I see the message and who it was sent to, but none of the details about the actual time and place.  I can't accept or reject the invite so it never gets added to my web calendar.  Even if I look at my email using the "Desktop" link, it doesn't show the details of the invite.  If I look at it from my laptop, I see the details and can accept the invite and have it show on my calendar.
I do not want to add this account as a mail account on my iPhone, so web access is the best.  Other then not seeing the invite details, I have no other problems.  Is there a way to see those details?

A: Wallace, to get the full functionality, you should add your google apps as exchange account. Google has provided details for this at the following link:
