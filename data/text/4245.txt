Q: Automate Mouse and Keyboard interactions similiar to OneClick for MacOS 9? I need to batch a process that requires me to automate some key presses.  All I need to be able to do is hit the enter key, wait 5 seconds, hit the enter key again, wait 5 minutes, and then cmd + w to close the current window.
In the MacOS 9 days I would use OneClick by WestCode software:

Is there a similar tool for MacOS X, Snow Leopard specifically?  In this particular instance I do not need to can the focus of windows or anything else.  I just need to automate key presses within a program at various intervals.

A: Have you tried to use automator and its record actions feature? Described here

A: The closest thing I could find was to use a combination of Automator's "Watch Me Do" actions and AppleScript to simulate key presses.  I wrote a tutorial and posted my Automator workflow here:
