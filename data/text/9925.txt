Q: Fine Adjustment in Playback on Itunes How do I do fine adjustment on the progress of video playback in iTunes?
For example, on the iPad, if you slide you finger down while holding onto the dot on the playback progress bar, you will go into fine adjustment mode and you track the progress second by second.
Btw, I'm on OS x
Thanks

A: Maybe that's helpful.
