Q: How can I backup all my jailbroken iPhone apps saves before restoring to new firmware? I have a jailbroken iPhone (3Gs, iOS 4.0.1, bb 5.13.04). I want to get jailbroken & unlocked 4.3.1 , but I cannot do it in other way than restoring from custom pwned firmware, so all my saves and app data will be erased.
How can I back up all my app data and games saves to restore them after firmware upgrade?
Thanks in advance.

A: There is an insanely detailed step by step process on how to do this using the cydia app appbackup on http://applemonday.com/2011/04/jailbreak-data-apps-ios-appbackup/ which basically grabs all your app data and puts it in one folder for you to ssh into and get.

A: PKGBackup ($7 from Cydia) will back up all your settings to Dropbox.

A: There is a new app out there, called Datadeposit and it saves your data to your dropbox account whyle syncing it. Awesome! http://www.iphonehacks.com/2011/05/datadeposit-nifty-jailbreak-app-allows-you-to-save-iphone-app-data-in-the-cloud-dropbox.html
