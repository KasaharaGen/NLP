Q: Problem when updating using Software Update I tried to update Mac OS X using Software Update. But when I tap on software updates, it's checking software updates and listing the available updates. 
I didn't see Mac OS X update available in the list. I am not able to do this. Can you guys please help ?

A: What is your current OS X version ??
The latest OS X is 10.6.7 - and if you can't get it through "Software Update", then you can download the whole OS X v10.6.7 Update Combo here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1361

A: You may already be on the latest version (check with the menu item  > About This Mac).
If not, you may have accidentally “Ignored” the update (⌫ in Software Update or the menu item Update > Ignore Update…).
You might try the Software Update menu item Software Update > Reset Ignored Updates (it is only enabled if you have Ignored an update in the past).
