Q: is there an application to manage bookmarks? I hate the in-built book mark managers of all browsers, it quickly becomes too messy and important links are hard to find
Is there desktop application which deal with bookmarks? something that has multiple options of fitters: categories, folders, tags and more 
For example the task manager, omnifocus, is as simple or as complex as you want it to be, is there anything like that for bookmarks

A: Take a look at Xmarks. It stores the bookmarks on an Xmarks-server, so they are available from everywhere. It's compatible with Safari, IE, Firefox and Chrome.

A: In addition to the other answers posted here, I suggest looking at a few different online bookmarking sites:


*

*http://diigo.com

*http://pinboard.in

*(and yes) Delicious.com 


Most of these services have add-ons or extensions to access the bookmarks. :)
(I really like diigo.com)

A: Try URL Manager Pro. It's been around for a very long time, and is still under active development. It has received excellent reviews. It's Lion-compatible, and is also available in the Mac App Store.

A: I created a different kind of bookmarking app for Mac: http://fetching.io
In addition to all the bookmarking features, it saves a full copy of every web page you visit then let's you easily search your index to re-find pages later. It' a totally different way of doing things. You don't have to remember to save anything since everything is saved and super easy to find later, even months or years later.
