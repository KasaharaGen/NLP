Q: High quality USB microphone that works on the iPhone 4 Can you recommend a high quality USB microphone that works on the iPhone 4? (Apparently there are issues with the iPhone 4 and USB microphones)

A: By "there are issues with the iPhone 4 and USB microphones," are you referring to the fact that no one has ever gotten them to work together?
The iPad, yes—but not the iPhone 4.
(Which, I think, answers the question about which mic I recommend…)

A: It looks like the Tascam IM2 is the only game in town (and just released). Its features are 125dB SPL, 95dB S/N, 20Hz-20kHz, if eBay listings are believable.
