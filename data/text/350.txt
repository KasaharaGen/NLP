Q: How can I make my first generation iPad's battery last longer? What are some of the things I can do to make my iPad (Wi-Fi) battery last a long time once it is charged?
I have the first generation iPad and run iOS 3.

A: Additionally, your iPad’s battery life will eventually last longer if you follow the Apple’s Advice, specially regarding battery’s temperature.

A: Turn down screen brightness, don't play games, turn off bluetooth. Standard battery life increasing tips.
How much longer do you need it? I understand that the battery life (even with WiFi) is fairly decent on the iPad. 

A: Killing apps manually will not affect battery life without effecting user experience.
Apps that stay active in the background typically do so for a limited time because they have a specific task that needs completing (like completing a download, or sending a mail message.)
iOS manages background processing aggressively in order to ensure that no extra battery is used unnecessarily.

A: If you don't need to connect to a network turn off WiFi.  You will also want to go into the Settings:


*

*turn down the brightness (Brightness & Wallpaper)

*turn off Bluetooth (General)

*turn off "Push" and set mail to fetch manually (Mail, Contact, Calendars) / (Fetch New Data)

*turn off sounds (General)

*turn off location services (General)

*Turn off Notifications

*and check any apps to see if any poll wifi (if you keep it on)

In the end, it really depends on how you use your iPad.  Good luck!--

A: If you're running the beta of iOS 4.2, killing multitasking apps can also impact battery life.
