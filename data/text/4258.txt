Q: Open webpage on iPad from Mac Is there an app out there that I can have on my mac that does the following:
Basically if I am on a website on my macbook, I want to be able to click a button on the browser and the same page to pop open wirelessly on my ipad.

A: You should check out Handoff.

A: Not natively, but as others have pointed out, some third party software does that.
In iOS 5, you'd be able to save it to a bookmark (or a "reading list") that will be synced automatically to your iPad through iCloud. That's the closest one I can think of. Just make a bookmark folder of "Open on iPad", and put it on your bookmarks bar.

A: Here's a list of options thus far.


*

*Safari's native Reading List

*Handoff

*Prowl

*Ansible

A: Also check out prowl, and the browser add-ons that go with it. I use Send2Prowl for firefox.

A: Ansible is a good option.
