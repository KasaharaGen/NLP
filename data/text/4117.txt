Q: is there Dictionary app on iphone that can translate word printed on real paper? Is there any Dictionary app act like this:
1.capturing the image of the word on the book by its camera
2.converting the image of the word to text,and show its meaning in other languages  

A: Yes, application is called Word Lens, and the technology behind it is darn impressive :)
Have a look at the video presentation.
But it only works for translations from english to spanish (and vice-versa). Supposedly more languages to come but no progress since it launched.
