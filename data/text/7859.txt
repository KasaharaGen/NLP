Q: Can I configure my apple remote with custom keys/functions? I would like to press the < or > button on my apple remote, and "virtually" make the mac think I pressed the left arrow ← or the right arrow → key.
Is there a free application for that? 
I've found:

A: Great, I've found iRedLite! I can create my own mappings (they are called layers in iRedLite) with this. :)
And here some other great tips... (old post, but a good reference!)
