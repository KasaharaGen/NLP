Q: Does removing the battery while connected to power extend battery life? On regular Windows notebooks people generally remove their battery packs when connected to a power source, in order to extend battery life.
Does a similar approach work on the Mac?

A: On many recent Macs, you cannot remove the battery (at least not easily), so this simply wouldn't work.
In general, it's kind of pointless to do that, as you're negating a benefit of having the battery: if the power goes out or the cable gets pulled (especially if it's a magnetic cable), you lose power just like a desktop would.
Ultimately, I would recommend not bothering in either the Mac or Windows case.

A: Since OSX has protection built-in to keep from continuously charging the battery, you shouldn't remove it, there is no benefit.
Part of that protection is that if you plug in your laptop >95% charge, it won't actually charge the battery, and will run off of the power adapter.        

A: Recent versions of MacOS notice when the notebook tends to be run with power connected and stops charging at somewhere between 80 and 90 %, which protect the long-term health of the battery.
