Q: Is it possible to upgrade iOS without connecting the device to a computer? Is it possible to upgrade the iOS version and apps on an iPhone without connecting it to a computer and going through iTunes?

A: Devs still have to upgrade through iTunes, Xcode only lets you put other apps on your phone. So no, there really isn't another way. 

A: Well, you can connect it to an Apple computer running Xcode and upgrade it there. But most non-developers would find that more horrible, not less.
