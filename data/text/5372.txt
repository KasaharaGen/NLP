Q: Mac App Store shows OS X Lion installed after interrupted connection I purchased Lion from the Mac App Store and for some reason my connection got cut, after that Mac App Store says that the app is INSTALLED when i can't see it anywhere.
I tried to check for unfinished downloads but it still says: INSTALLED
I should note that i'm on Lion GM and the installer was downloading in LaunchPad, but i can't see it anymore
i tried:


*

*Rebuilding LaunchServices

*Look for the installer


Any idea? thanks

A: If you select any tab in the App Store except for purchase and hold the option key down when you select purchased, you can re-download the Lion installer.
Using spotlight may also reveal that you have the installer somewhere on the mac - even an external drive and might avoid the delay and bandwidth use to download the installer again.
