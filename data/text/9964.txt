Q: Transmission aborts automated shut down. My ISP offers unlimited downloads at a certain time period at night, but I don't want to wake up to shutdown my MBP 13.3 at that time. I tried to specify a certain shutdown time using the Energy Saver option.
However, I found out to my utter dismay that Transmisison needs to be explicitly closed before it for the computer to shut down.

A: *

*In Transmission go to the preferences

*uncheck System sleep under Network


*uncheck Quit with active transfers under General
