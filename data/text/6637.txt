Q: Plugged in new iPhone - iTunes is now using a foreign language I just got a new iPhone. I plugged it into my computer (iTunes was already installed). After clicking through the registration windows, iTunes displayed the screen below to me.
Does anyone know how to get this back to English? (So far, I haven't been game to press either the white or the blue button)

I live in Australia.

A: A similar case to what you are experiencing can be found here:

Pretty weird stuff, but apart from restarting the computer you can try purchasing a free app (I assume through iTunes on the computer), another suggestion that I have read resolved this was to unplug the iPhone and do a reset (hold down the home and lock buttons until the apple logo appears) and then plug it back in when prompted.

A: Well, that looks like simplified Chinese. No idea though how you might have gotten there. Is it the first time your iTunes app behaves this way?
And I assume you are in North America... this would discard the idea that the interface is location-aware.
Maybe deinstalling and reinstalling iTunes? After having backed up your data of course... :-)
