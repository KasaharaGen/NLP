Q: How do I disable Safari-only mode? I have no desire to enable Lion's Safari-only mode. I have disabled the guest account but still see the guest login item when I reboot my system.
Is there a setting somewhere I'm missing for disabling the Safari-only mode?

A: This guest account is tied in with iCloud's Find My Mac service in System Preferences. If you disable that service, the Safari-only mode (and the subsequent Guest account on the login screen) will also be disabled.

A: It looks like you can disable it wihtout disabling 'find my iphone' by following steps in this article. I doubt that 'find my iphone' will be much use though if the person who steals it can't login, but who knows.

A: You can disable the Guest account at startup in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Advanced (the button at the bottom of the screen. The checkbox says "Disable restarting to Safari when screen is locked". I believe that it leaves the iCloud settings unchanged.

This works without changing iCloud.

A: Guest account should disappear when you disable it, (i.e. when you uncheck Allow guests to login to this computer) so your settings must have become slightly corrupted.
To fix them, try reenabling Guest account in the settings, rebooting, then disabling guest account. 

A: to disable Safari-only mode and the guest account go to
system preferences
iCloud
and then uncheck  (Find My Mac) <--  thats mean you will disable this fissility .
Reboot
Thats all
