Q: Am I supposed to buy Lion twice? I've formatted my mac, and I've reinstalled Snow Leopard from installation CD. Successively I've accessed to the mac store to download Lion again and install it on top of the fresh Snow Leopard installation, and suprise: the mac store asks me to buy it again.
I'm using the same user profile (Apple ID).

A: I can't delete this question anymore, so I provide the solution: I had 2 different accounts.
The problem is that I've used my email for one account, instead of using my nickname, and this generated the second account. I think they should recognize emails, and warn you, you already have an account with this email, to avoid issues like mine.

A: No. If you buy the Lion upgrade, it can be downloaded and installed on all of the macs you own or control (as long as you aren't using it as a business or commercial manner.)

(as an aside)
Getting Lion with a new mac isn't the same as buying the upgrade - you aren't supposed to take that download and use it on other macs. (even if you can figure out how - it's more a licensing issue than a technical one)
