Q: New iOS release, what time are they traditionally released (on release day)? I was curious about what time apple traditionally has released its major iOS updates in the past? 
I could see several times that make sense:


*

*at 12:00am PST?

*at midnight local time across the globe?


I wonder if past major releases are random/indeterminate when they come out?
(Of course, it takes some time to propagate the update through their CDN, and there really is no way to determine when any individual might get a change to download an iOS update)

A: Most Apple software updates seem to get posted around 1PM Eastern/10AM Pacific. Far from a guarantee however, that's just my approximation based on past experience and a super quick Google to confirm.

A: At midnight or 1am local time.
