Q: How do I write to NTFS drives in OS X? What is the best, easiest, preferably cheapest way to make OS X write to NTFS-formatted drives in Mac OS X?

A: The simplest solution would be to use MacFUSE and NTFS-3G for MacFUSE, though as of this post only Tuxera NTFS (
~$35 USD) and PARAGON Software NTFS for OS X  v.9.0 ($19.95 USD) support 10.7. You can grab the source for free from Tuxera for free, however.
As of OS X 10.6 you can natively enable NTFS support, though your mileage may vary. Follow this writeup by Mac OS X Hints if you're interested but I'd use the MacFUSE method over this one. Keep in mind that neither of these methods are fully supported.

A: Here's how to do a one-time mount using ntfs-3g (coeur's answer but for one time use).  This way doesn't require you to boot into safe mode or use csrutil at all.
NB: using ntfs-3g this way is rumored to be "safer" for write access than the built-in ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse mount option:
Install latest osxfuse (3.x.x) from https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases. Or install it from Homebrew with:
brew cask install osxfuse

Install latest NTFS-3GNTFS-3G from Homebrew (https://brew.sh/Homebrew), as follow:
brew install ntfs-3g

One time mount (replace disk1s1 with your values, discoverable by running a mount command after inserting the disk, you'll see a line like
/dev/disk1s1 on /Volumes/SomeNtfsDrive (ntfs, local, nodev, nosuid, read-only, noowners) grab the disk1s1:
 diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
 sudo mkdir /Volumes/my_writable_ntfs
 sudo /usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/my_writable_ntfs -olocal -oallow_other

You'll get a popup "system extension blocked" click "Open Security Preferences" and click "Allow" next to the developer name (Benjamin Fleischer). If you can't click the allow button, see here.
Run the command again after clicking allow.  It'll be good until you reboot.  or manually dismount it.
For more details and instructions on making it permanent, see https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/NTFS-3G

A: Can't say that using MacFUSE and NTFS-3G for MacFUSE is the easiest way, but they are free and that's great!:) I've used them for about a year until bought 500GB external Seagate HDD and got Paragon NTFS for Mac driver for free from Seagate site: http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/. Works stable for a month, no problems happened yet. Anybody knows, will users of Seagate HDDs get free NTFS driver upgrade for new OS X when Apple will release it?

A: Before we start. Make sure your external name label is ONE word.
That means there is no space in between.
my disk = WRONG
my_disk or my-disk or mydisk = CORRECT
Now


*

*Open Terminal [Command+Space+"terminal"]

*Type: sudo nano /etc/fstab

*In nano, type: LABEL=my_disk none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse Note: my_disk is your disk name

*To save and exit Control+X and Enter and Enter

*[optional] For ease of access, we create a sym-link to desktop: In terminal -> sudo ln -s /Volumes ~/Desktop/Volumes
Later
When you don't need it anymore. It is as simple as:
In terminal sudo rm /etc/fstab

FUSE for OS X - Successor to MacFUSE
NTFS-3G
Requires a build from source for anything newer than 2010. Last "pre built" version linked from http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/ntfs-3g-for-mac-os-x-2010102.html You can build it from source using homebrew in the other answers.

MacFuse is abandonware, and hasn't been updated since 2009. 

A: This answer is for latest compatibility for OS X 10.11 El Capitan, macOS 10.12 Sierra, macOS 10.13 High Sierra, macOS 10.14 Mojave.
It needs an update for Apple Silicon and Monterey and Big Sur and Catalina so proceed with caution

*

*Install latest osxfuse (3.x.x) from GitHub. Or install it with Homebrew as follow:
brew cask install osxfuse



*Install latest NTFS-3G with Homebrew as follow:
brew install ntfs-3g



*Auto-mount NTFS volumes in read-write mode:
Link NTFS-3G to boot after temporary disabling System Integrity Protection, as follow:
* [reboot by holding <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to get in recovery mode]

        csrutil disable

* [reboot normally]

        sudo mount -uw /
        sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original
        sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs

* [reboot by holding <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to get in recovery mode]

        csrutil enable

* [reboot normally]

You will need to re-link manually (step 3) each year when you upgrade macOS (10.11 → 10.12 → 10.13 → 10.14 → ...)
Additional steps if solution does not work:

*

*try to install ntfs-3g again
 brew install ntfs-3g



*it warns that it installed but not linked, try to link again:
 brew link ntfs-3g



*it fails and prints dry-run command which will show files to remove:
 brew link --overwrite --dry-run ntfs-3g



*remove these files with sudo ('Would remove:' is for English console)
 brew link --overwrite --dry-run ntfs-3g | grep -vF 'Would remove:' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs sudo rm



*try to link again and get permission error on creation /usr/local/share/doc/ntfs-3g. brew prevents running with sudo so prepare directory for README:
 sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/doc/ntfs-3g
 sudo chmod a+w /usr/local/share/doc/ntfs-3g



*run brew link again... success.


*reboot your Mac and allow system extension to load in System Preferences as error box suggests.

A: I tested this on Mountain lion and it is free and you don't need to reboot. It uses OS X's native NTFS drivers.


*

*Plug-in your device

*Write in Terminal diskutil list and look for IDENTIFIER where TYPE is Windows_NTFS.

In this case it is disk1s1

*Then run the following:
diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
cd /Volumes
mkdir Elements
sudo mount -w -t ntfs -o rw,nobrowse /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/Elements
open /Volumes/Elements


A: This answer is for macOS BigSur:
The big difference with previous answer by Cœur:
we need to turn off cryptographic verification (See Big Sur’s Signed System Volume: added security protection) with csrutil authenticated-root disable in step 3.2 and bless to create a snapshot in step 4.

*

*Install macFUSE from macFUSE or brew --cask install osxfuse


*Install ntfs-3g with brew install gromgit/fuse/ntfs-3g-mac or try other options to install ntfs-3g


*Disable SIP(System Integrity Protection)
3.1 Reboot Mac into Recovery Mode by rebooting and holding down Command+R
3.2 Utilities > Terminal:
csrutil disable(enable it after the whole process)
csrutil authenticated-root disable (It cannot be enabled after updating /sbin/mount_ntfs)
3.3 Reboot in normal mode


*Update /sbin/mount_ntfs
4.1 Get the root disk by mount, if /dev/disk1s5s1 on /  is returned, your root disk is /dev/disk1s5
4.2 update and create snapshot
DISK_PATH=/dev/disk1s5
MOUNT_PATH=~/mount
mkdir $MOUNT_PATH
sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs $DISK_PATH $MOUNT_PATH
sudo mv $MOUNT_PATH/sbin/mount_ntfs        $MOUNT_PATH/sbin/mount_ntfs.original
sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs $MOUNT_PATH/sbin/mount_ntfs

sudo bless --folder $MOUNT_PATH/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot



*Reboot and enable SIP with command: csrutil enable
