Q: Using git on the iPhone I have a jailbroken iPhone 3GS running 4.0.1, and I recently installed git from Cydia just for fun. I've noticed in recent weeks that a number of developers have been throwing their theme/plugin source code up on GitHub, which is theoretically awesome because updating is a 2-command process (cd /private/var/stash/Themes/<theme>.theme/ and git pull) that can be done on the phone itself.
But when I try to clone a repo, this happens:
Dylan:/private/var/stash/Themes root# git clone "http://github.com/dcinzona/LockInfo-Status-Bar-Icons---Winterboard-Theme.git/GMT Statusbar Icons.theme"Initialize GMT Statusbar Icons.theme/.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/var/stash/Themes/GMT Statusbar Icons.theme/.git/

fatal: Fetch failed.

Can anyone tell me why? Am I missing something?

A: It looks like github is sending you back the 404 page because you're requesting it specifically over http. Try this url instead:
git://github.com/dcinzona/LockInfo-Status-Bar-Icons---Winterboard-Theme.git/GMT Statusbar Icons.theme
