Q: Is there somewhere I can write my name on iPod touch, for if I lost it? Where in my iPod Touch I can write my name and phone number, so if I lost it or it been stolen and found by the police (as I read that happened), someone could call me to go get it back?

A: No, but you can create an image that has your name and contact info on it, then use that as your lock screen wallpaper.
You could also create a note on the device or an "emergency/lost" contact in the address book, but both of those require you to not use a passcode to use the device. A wallpaper with contact info works even if the person who finds your iPod can't unlock it.

A: If you are really fussed about this then you can go to an engraver and get your name and phone number engraved on the back.

A: You can also install Find My iPod Touch if you have a 4th gen iPod Touch. I'm not sure if it works on earlier models, but it might.

A: I put a sticker on back containing my work contact information in large print.  Easy to read even if the batteries are dead.
