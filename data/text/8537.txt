Q: What are some quality small business management programs? I manage a small lawn business, I currently use about 12 tabs in Excel and keep track of customers, expenses, income, payroll, etc. I now have an iMac and am wondering what quality small business management programs are available.

A: There's always Office for Mac if you like Excel, Numbers, and a host of other business apps. Check out the Mac App Store's "Business" section for more. Do realize, however, that Office for Mac isn't exactly the same as it is on Windows, and may not necessarily be worth the hefty price tag.

A: Easy Books by Geode Software provides complete accounting, invoicing, and time-tracking functions on your Mac â€“ which looks like it's a good fit for your lawn business.
