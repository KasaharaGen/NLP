Q: Why does Reply All also reply to me? I've setup an Exchange account to point to my work address and it works pretty well.  The only annoyance is that if I receive an email that has several recipients, pressing Reply All, also includes me on the To or CC list.  
When I do the same operation in Outlook, I am not included in the To/CC list.  
How can I get the iPhone to stop including me on the Reply All?

A: A coworker pointed out an inconsistency with my email account and that led to the resolution of the issue.  
On our corporate server, there is a main email address and you could also make any number of aliases.  So for instance, my email address is frankrizzo@mycompany.com.  But if you send me an email to frank.rizzo@mycompany.com or frank+rizzo@mycompany.com, it will reach me as well.
In the iPhone, I entered my account as frank.rizzo@mycompany.com (with the dot).  However, people kept sending emails to my main account - frankrizzo@mycompany.com - without the dot.  The iPhone saw the one without the dot as not mine and thus was including it on the Reply All screen.

A: I think this only happened on older versions of the software.  I just tested it on iOS 4.2.1 and it didn't happen to me but I remember it used to happen.  I don't know which version fixed it but you could update to the latest version of iOS and that should fix it.

A: I had the same issue and discovered the email address in my iPhone Mail app account was different from my actual email address. 
Therefore Mail.app did not recognize my address in emails sent to me as my own. I changed the email in account on Mail app and it works now
