Q: What does the new command on the f4-key do? I used to have a dashboard icon, which opened the dashboard when clicked on my keyboard.
But now there is another image, which does nothing when clicked.
What is it supposed to do?
How to I fix it?
How do I alternative assign it to dashboard again?

And what does the one with a crossed box do?

A: You need Lion to use the new F3 for Mission Control and the new F4 for Launchpad.

A: Solution to make the launchpad key work as dashboard-key:


*

*Install FunctionFlip

*Open Settings

*Goto Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control

*

*Check Dashboard and set it to f4


*Goto the Keyboard tab and check "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"

*Click the back button or "Show all" and open the FunctionFlip settings

*Check all the function-keys in "Select keys to flip" except F4

*

*Repeat this for all the keyboards. If you just want it to work normally also check F4


*Also check start FunctionFlip at login


A: F4 / fnF4 is supposed to toggle Launchpad. If it doesn't do anything, see if Show Launchpad is checked in the Keyboard preference pane:

It doesn't have to be assigned to any regular shortcut though.
