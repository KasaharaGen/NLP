Q: How can I fix permission issue when I cannot start Mac OS X? I was creating a guest account and to prevent it from accessing the Macintosh HD as in other applications and stuff I assigned it as in "No Access" 
When I switched to the guest account everything blocked, I restarted my mac and all I get is a blue screen.
Now, I can't log in, not even in safe mode.
What can I do to fix this?

A: Boot to single user mode by holding command + S right after powering the system on (before the chime & apple logo). Once the system has booted to the command line, type these commands without the leading tick mark. Spaces matter, periods matter, it has to be exact.

*/sbin/mount -uw /

*cd /private/var/db

*rm .AppleSetupDone

*halt


The mac should shut off. Now power on - you will get played the normal welcome screen. Make a new user (try not to re-use one of the old names - "rescue account" might be a good choice). You can then go to the preference pane and see what happened to the users.

A: I had the same issue, I tried the answer that bmike provided, logged in on a new account and repaired my disk permissions.
After that I could login again.
