Q: Can I use my iMac as a display with my MacBook? Is it possible to attach my MacBook to my iMac and use the iMac as a display? What cable/connector would I need?
EDIT:
I have the newest MacBook and a Late 2009 21.5" iMac.

A: Which model of iMac do you have? Only the latest 27-inch model supports video in physically. There are software solutions if you don't have this model.
I'm not sure if this is the latest solution (I expect not), but it was a software solution to this problem. http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html
I'm sure I've seen something more recent than this, but can't find a link to it unfortunately.
Update: Found the software I was thinking of, the developers site is here: http://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html

A: Yes, it's possible with 27" iMac, but not sure about 21.5" one. The cable is "MagSafe connector".
Which iMac do you have ?
Please refer to Apple website for more info.
