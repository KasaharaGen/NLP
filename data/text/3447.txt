Q: OpenAFS client configuration I can't find any detailed guide on how to setup a client OpenAFS on Mac OS X.
I downloaded OpenAFS 1.5.78 from OpenAFS.org but I can't make it works.
I read that a panel for the system preferences should be installed, but I don't see anything.
My goal is not configure a server but just to connect to a cell as a client.
Any help would be very welcome.

A: Did you download http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.5.78/macos-10.6/OpenAFS-1.5.78-Snowleopard.dmg ? 
Upon opening it I was presented with a window with a few options, one of which said "Click icon to install".

I ran through this installer, entered my password, entered in a false cell name as I do not have a cell to connect to at the moment, and finished the install. 
I do now have a system preferences area called OpenAFS. 

It has all of the options though upon first running it does tell me there is an error with a config file not existing, I assume because I would create it and save it. 

Could you post any error messages from the console when you install OpenAFS? Are you an administrative user? Any other information would be useful in troubleshooting this.
