Q: Error 37 during restore On Tuesday I've updated my (non jailbroken) iPad 1 to iOS 4.3.5. When verifying the installation of the installation an error showed up telling me (translated from German) "The iPad cannot be restored. Unknown error (37)". Ever since when I try to restore my iPad I get this error.
I checked the Apple support site, but this just tells me to turn off my firewall in case I have a PC. I have a Mac, but tried it anyway. It doesn't help.
I set the iPad in DFU mode. Didn't help either. As there are no appointments in the local Genius bar within days, I hope to find a solution here.
So does anybody have any suggestions on how I can restore my iPad? 
I've already checked the following pages on the Apple website:
