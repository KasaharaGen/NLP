Q: Using Windows on Mac keyboard without Delete key I'm just curious - I guess lots of people with Mac hardware use Windows.
How do they manage to do so, given that delete key is missing on Mac keyboard and you have to press ctrl+alt+delete to log in to Windows?
Are they all forced to use autologin (to bypass ctrl+alt+delete pressing) or buy a PC keyboard?

A: When you press the Fn key, the backspace key (Mis-labeled "Delete") on a mac keyboard functions as the delete key.
Therefore, to log onto a windows install which requires Ctrl+Alt+Delete, you would press Ctrl+Alt+Fn+Backspace("Delete").
It's worth noting that this works even on the full wired keyboard, with a separate delete key.
