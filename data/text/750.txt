Q: Scanning a ton of pictures I'm rather disappointed that iPhoto has no direct ability to import from a scanner. I'm reduced to scanning in Preview, which has a less awful UI for scanning than the program that came with my HP scanner, and dragging the resulting files into iPhoto.
Is there some better scheme that I've missed?

A: Send the photos to a scanning service, especially if you have "tons".
