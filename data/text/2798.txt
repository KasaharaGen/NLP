Q: Is there a performance issue with GNU Screen, Tmux, and other similar development tools on the MacBook Air? I have a 2010 Macbook Air 11 inch, and it noticeably lags when I use tools like Gnu Screen, Tmux, and Vim, especially with vertical splits and during Screen/Tmux window switching.
Does anyone notice this performance issue?

A: The basic question is compared with what?
Yes it will be slower than a new MacBook , iMac etc but we programmed with those tools 10 years ago on slower machines.
All you can say is it slow for you and if so you need to get a faster machine:)
Which is why I have always programmed on a desktop machine as they are faster than laptops of a similar vintage

A: I find my Xcode iOS builds to be faster on my MBA 11 than on the Mac Pro at work.
