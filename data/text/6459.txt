Q: How to see all options configurable by "defaults write ..." Many Mac apps have "hidden" configurable options that can be modified in Terminal by using the defaults write ... command. This is straightforward to do if you know the name of the option that you want to configure ahead of time.
Is a list of values that each application actually uses tucked away somewhere in a master config file? 
How do people discover these options without a list of all configurable options for a given Application?
