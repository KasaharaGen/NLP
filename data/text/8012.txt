Q: Problem updating iPod Touch to iOS 5 Using iTunes to upgrade the OS on a 4th generation iPod Touch, the update downloads but when it attempts to install it the process fails with the following message:

The iPod "iPod Touch (4G)" could not be restored. An internal error occurred.

Any ideas what might cause this and how to avoid it?

A: It is server overload. Either keep trying or wait till the traffic dies down a little.

You can read more about it in this post.

A: iTunes always logs an error when this fails - which error did you get?

A: A possible reason is bad memory in the device. Newer versions of iOS tend to have a progressively larger memory footprint; if the larger size crosses a boundary in to the bad RAM area, the device will no longer boot up. I know of at least one iPhone owner with this unhappy result.
