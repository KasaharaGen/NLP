Q: Can I automaticly CC emails to an email address in Mail.app? Are there any email clients for Mac OSX (10.6.7) which can automaticly CC an email ID (without writing the CC email field)?

Update 1 - I want to give an email ID to all the team members. I am using a shared hosting for my site where I am going to create all the email ID's. I will configure these ID's in default Mail.app. Now whenever my team send emails to clients I want it to CC to my email ID automatically. 

A: If you switch your team over to Google apps, the Gmail web client lets you automatically cc or bcc every email, this is how I automated emails.

A: Have a look at MailActOn. It allows you to define rules for outgoing mails (among other things), one of the possible action is forwarding to a user-defined address.
