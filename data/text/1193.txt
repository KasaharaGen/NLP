Q: What speed does the A4 in the iPhone 4 run at? Apple made a big deal about the iPad's A4 running at 1GHz, but they've never said how fast the iPhone 4's processor is. In the teardown, iFixit mentions that the iPhone 4 uses an A4 but never gives a clock speed. Has anyone been able to find out how fast it actually is?

A: According to MacRumors and some German source the iPhone 4 is somewhat slower than the iPad, but still significantly faster than the iPhone 3GS. I guess that its A4 CPU is clocked at about 750 - 850 MHz.

A: The iPhone 4 is based on the same processor that is seen in the iPad and has a clock speed of 1Ghz.
The iPhone 4 also has 512mb of RAM which is double that of the 3GS and although never officially announced also double that of the iPad.

A: Though it's not confirmed, most sources claim that the A4 in the iPhone 4 is the same processor that runs the iPad, clocking in at 1ghz as you suggested.
