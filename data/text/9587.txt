Q: How can I get rid of duplicate Sent, Draft, and Trash folders in my IMAP accounts? I use several IMAP accounts for e-mail, and, except for iCloud, all of them show duplicate folders for Sent, Trash, and Draft mailboxes: 

These duplicate folders are (generally) always empty, and seem to have no special status (e.g. the absence of the special icons used in OS X or iOS Mail):

But there seems to be nothing I can do to get rid of them. Is there a way to delete these folders or configure my IMAP accounts so that I at least don't have to see them in my iOS and OS X Mail clients?

Addendum: Here's what the folders look like through the hosts webmail interface:


A: *

*Set Mail to use your operatorâ€™s folders by opening them and selecting Mailbox>Use this mailbox for>[folder function].

*Move all messages from old folders to the new ones

*Delete the old, now empty folders.


A: This has to do with the IMAP severs. Some folders can be visible, others hidden.
A program like Mail.app shows all folder that it see by default.
If you want to hide some, you need to hide them in the preferences of the email provider.
E.g.:
I've got a Gmail account. By default in Gmail the folders/labels sent, marked, trash... etc. are shown. Unlike Mail.app, Google mail has an option to disable these in Gmail.
On the other hand, Mail.app adds the Junk-E-Mail folder/label. I disabled the Junk-E-Mail option in the App and deleted the folder, since Google's spam filter is more reliable for my taste.
Solution for Gmail

A: Ok, since you're using an iPhone - which is the reason for the extra labels - follow these instructions:


*

*On your iPhone, go to Settings -> Mail -> (Account Name) -> Account Info -> Advanced

*Under Mailbox Behaviors for Drafts, choose Drafts. On the iPhone this will save all drafts locally.

*For Sent Mailbox choose Sent Mail ON THE SERVER. 

*Do the same for Trash.

*In Mail.app, click on the Sent Mail mailbox of the provider. Then on Mailbox -> Use this Mailbox For -> Sent.

*Do the same for Trash.
After a few sync's it should work as expected.
