Q: Registering as individual for iOS development still requires company name I actually have 3 questions, but the one in the title is the main one.


*

*As I was trying to register, I have entered my apple ID and that takes me to a page where I can edit my contact info. I can change everything, except my name, which I would need to change, since somehow there is a wrong name there. (It is actually an old name which I have changed and if I go to "manage my apple ID" page I can see the new name, just the developer site still has the old one). Since they will probably be checking that against information on my credit card this could be a problem.

*Even though I am registering as an individual, there is still a field for company name and it has to be filled. What do I put there?

*This would probably be more of a question for apple directly, but in case someone knows, can I use a pseudonym to be shown as the "app seller", because I would rather have that than my full name there.
I tried to contact apple about these issues, but it seems that you need to be registered there to receive any support.
Thanks in advance!

Put your name again.

A: To have a company name as seller name in all places in the App store, you need to enroll as a company.  In order to enroll as a company, you will need to have valid state incorporation papers under the company name.
