Q: iPad in corporate environment Company portal has Windows authentication with SSO. 
But iPad is not domain member, so ask password on every SSO company site. 
Is there a way to setup iPad for domain authentication ? 

A: No, it isn't possible. That would require an OS that supports username/password authentication, which iOS doesn't do.
