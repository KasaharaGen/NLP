Q: Bootcamp Windows 7 loading time optimization I've created a bootcamp partition and successfully installed Windows 7 there. The problem is that Windows loads too slow - there is a white pointer on black screen blinking for 2 or 3 minutes before system starts loading, so total loading time exeeds to 4 minutes.
How can I reduce Windows loading time?
I'm using MBP 2010 MC371, so there should be no perfomance problems.

A: You could try the solution on http://viperfx07.blogspot.com but I haven't had the problem myself so I can't say whether it will solve your issue
Just to note that this may be due to your copy of Windows not being genuine
