Q: App on MAS that writes mathematical formulae into an image? I remember an app that was featured on the Mac App Store a while ago that allows you to write mathematical formulae into an image.
I can't find it now though. Does anyone know what it is?

A: It isn't in the Mac App Store, but try LaTeXiT.  
As you might have guessed, it uses Latex input to create an image of the equation.  You can link the image into a Keynote or Pages document (or others, I'd imagine).  Live updating, etc.
I use it frequently, and love it!
