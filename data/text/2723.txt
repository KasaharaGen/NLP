Q: What IR receivers would work on a 2010 MacBook Air? If you didn't already know, the 2010 MacBook Air doesn't have an IR receiver.
Does anyone know of a very small and cheap IR receiver that would work with a MacBook Air and the Apple Remote?
Here are a couple of examples, do you know if they work?

*Micro Mini USB to Infrared IrDA Wireless Port Dongle Adapter Receiver PC

*Syba SD-U1IRDA-NM USB Fast Infra-Red Adapter
Also, are there any good bluetooth remotes that work similarly to the Apple IR remote, and have similar design quality and size?

A: For IR, it sounds like you want Twisted Melon's Manta TR1 ($20).
As far as a Bluetooth remote goes, it depends on what you want to do with the remote. If all that matters to you is cheap, take a look at the Targus Bluetooth Laser Presentation Remote (~$20).
