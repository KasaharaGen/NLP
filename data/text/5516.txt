Q: Where does Mac OS X store contacts in my Address Book? Where does Mac OS X store contacts in my Address Book? Has this changed from Snow Leopard to Lion?

A: The path is ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/ on both Snow Leopard and Lion.
Note that you can't see the Library in your home folder (as it is hidden by default). You can type in chflags nohidden ~/Library in Terminal to make it appear permanently, or hold down ‚å• Option while in the "Go" menu of Finder.

A: 
On SL, it's in 
  
  
*
  
*~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Metadata
  
  
  I can't answer for Lion.

Lion is the same....
In High Sierra, its in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources/

A: from my experience of just trying to recover those files with TimeMachine in Mavericks, the location in Mavericks appears to be incorrect.

A: OSX 10.9.1 go to Contacts.app, highlight the contact(s) select more than one with the shift key, press DELETE then OK
