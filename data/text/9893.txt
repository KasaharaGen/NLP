Q: Is there a way to use Notes without using Mail.app With iCloud I've found the notes app super handy now that it easily syncs to my iPhone and iPad. It also syncs to my mac via Mail.app, but I was wondering if there's an easy way to access and edit notes that doesn't require opening my email.
Any way to do this?

A: Currently there is no way to use notes outside of Mail.app as suggested there are other apps like evernote that will sync but not iOS notes sadly. 
I would have expected some kind of widget like stickies to work with notes, but no.
