Q: Application to periodically update desktop with new images from Flickr tag search? Are there any applications I can use to periodically download new images from a Flickr tag search and update my desktop picture (preferably with support for multiple monitors)?

A: DeskLickr is a few years old, and I've not tried it, but it should do what you want.
