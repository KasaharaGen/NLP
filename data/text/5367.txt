Q: How to move Lion installer to another Mac? I installed Lion on my MacBook Pro.  Worked great.
Now I want to install it on my iMac, I don't want to re-download it from the App Store because it's a 3.5GB download and I have to pay for all my bandwidth (yes, I'm Canadian).
Is the installer executable on my MacBook Pro somewhere?  If so, where is it and can I just copy it to the iMac and run it?
Thanks,
Rob

A: Unfortunately the installer package contains the source files for the installation and this package is deleted once installation has completed.
If you still have the installer in Applications, right-click on it and Show Package Contents then browse to the /Contents/SharedSupport/ folder and look for the InstallESD.dmg disk image. This image can be burnt to a dvd saving future downloads but I am afraid you are going to have to download it again. 

A: Unfortunately the installer is removed after a successful installation of Lion, so you'll probably need to download it again.

A: As described here, you can save a copy prior to install: http://www.cultofmac.com/save-your-bandwidth-prevent-os-x-lion-installer-from-self-destructing/105470

A: From another question....
Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install? 
Joel has a nice set of instructions on how to do this.
