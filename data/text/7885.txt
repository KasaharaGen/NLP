Q: Why isn't search working in Finder? In Finder, the search bar in the top right corner has ceased to function. Observe:

Obviously, there should be something with the letter "s" in it. But no results appear. It's just blank. Anything I search for, anywhere I search for it, it all fails.

A: Other than your Finder having jaundice, this should be a simple fix. The following command will clear the volumes local store and rebuild it if necessary; Open up Terminal and type:
# sudo mdutil -E /



*

*You will be asked for your password, provide it, as this command
requires administrator privileges to run.

*After confirming your Spotlight index will be re-built and your files
should appear in the search. ( Depending on the size of your HDD it
can take a while )



To check if all volumes have indexing enabled or disabled use:
# mdutil -s -a

To toggle (enable/disable) indexing on all volumes: 
# mdutil -a -i

These commands are safe to use when/if you encounter similar issues as described in the question.

Complete options available:
 -p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally.  This option requests
     that a local caches be flushed to the appropriate network device.

 -E  This flag will cause each local store for the volumes indicated to be erased.
     The stores will be rebuilt if appropriate.

 -i on | off
     Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note that index-
     ing may be delayed due to low disk space or other conditions.

 -s  Display the indexing status of the listed volumes.

 -a  Apply command to all volumes.

 -v  Print verbose information when available.

A: Being as the UI is a better way to go than to jump right away into Terminal, try the following from Apple's support documentation:


*

*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.

*Click Spotlight.

*Click the Privacy tab.

*Drag a folder or even an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list.

*Remove the item or volume you just added.


Failing these steps and the steps advised by the others, try creating a new user and seeing if search works in Finder. If it still does not work, then search is broken system-wide and an Archive & Install will not help. You'll want to back up your data and reinstall the OS. If an Apple Store is close, they can be of assistance here (no charge).
