Q: How do you burn a CD in iTunes? How do you burn a CD within iTunes?
I want to be able to burn some music to a CD, but I just can't find the option.

A: Select a bunch of songs, pick File → New Playlist from Selection, name it, and pick File → Burn Playlist to Disc.

A: As Sören says, you cannot arbitrarily pick a selection of songs and burn them in one step, you can only burn a playlist.  This does give you the opportunity to ensure that the total length will fit on your disc at least, but it does seem a little pointless.
