Ratings and Reviews not showing up for newly released app. Is there a standard delay or is something wrong? 

I don't know whats wrong with Apple Customer Ratings system on Appstore.
Recently I have uploaded two apps on appstore. And still there are no ratings/reviews on apps. Infact I observed there are 1000s of downloads has been made in last 2 days.
To verify this 1 of my friend also added his comment with rating yesterday on 1 of my App. But his comment also not visible, still there are zero customer reviews in both Apps.
Can anyone update me regarding this issue ?
