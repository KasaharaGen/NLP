Q: Can Mail count unread messages (for the Dock icon) from only some of my accounts? I have 7 mail accounts configured with Apple Mail. The dock icon shows the count of new emails for all of my accounts. How can I disable notification for 2 of those 7 accounts, so it just shows me the counter for the other 5 accounts?

A: Do a SmartMailbox with the folders from which you want the counts to come, and then select that in Mail's General settings --> "Dock unread count" (it's the fourth drop down list)

A: I'm not aware of a way to do this natively, but DockStar offers this kind of functionality, among other things. Their FAQ states that the latest version supports Lion, as well.
