Q: Escape doesn't work OS: OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.7
After a several months of work escape key stopped working. But it works with the Command, Option and Control keys (checked with 'Keyboard View').
Restarted finder with moving com.apple.finder.plist and com.apple.systemprefernces.plist.
How to fix it?

A: Fixed by removing box.net application, it somehow shadowed escape key...
