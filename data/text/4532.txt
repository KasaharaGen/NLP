Q: Removing gray part of BBEdit/TextWrangler How can I remove the gray part in BBEdit/TextWrangler.
I want it to be white as the other part.

A: It is called the page guide. You can hide it in TextWrangler in two ways:

*

*For a single document, select "Hide Page Guide" from the "View -> Text Display" Menu.



*To hide it for all documents, there is a setting in the "Text Status Display" category.
