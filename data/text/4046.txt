Q: Why does my iPhone create contacts with a random photo? I have a strange issue on my iPhone 4 running 4.3.2, the device is jailbroken.
When I add a new contact, the contacts application seems to assign a random photo to newly created contacts. My phone syncs with mobile me so this is replicated across all my devices.


*

*I create a new contact

*I click done.

*I view the contact and it has a random picture assigned to it.




Does anyone know what causes this? 

A: Have you tried wiping the device and starting with this - it's usually corruption in the address book database - even on devices that haven't been jailbroken. You might have luck just starting new with that before a total restore.
