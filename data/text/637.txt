Q: iPhone App for Displaying Email on a Locked Screen with Exchange Support I have an app, "mail notifier" that sends notifications to my phone when I get a new email, it does not support Exchange though.
Is there an app that is similar that does support exchange, maybe an app that does 'local' notifications so there is not a reoccurring cost?

A: iOS 5 has added this feature to operating system, and no app is needed to accomplish this task.

A: LockInfo

LockInfo gives you access to your information where you need it, when you need it. You can view your new emails, upcoming calendar events, unread SMSs, missed calls and much more on your lockscreen, SpringBoard or even within any application on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.


A: You can try Boxcar.
You'll have to trust them, though, since the way to get visual notification for new mail is to forward all your mail to a @boxcar.io address generated only for your account.
Then, everytime you'll get a mail, it will be forwarded to your Boxcar address and pushed to your iPhone.
