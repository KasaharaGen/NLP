Q: App for Cropping and Resizing an image Is there an application where I can crop an image then resize it into custom dimensions?
I would like to crop it like with the built in Command+Shift+4 , then in a window I could select the dimensions.
So is there an app for this?

A: But of course Preview!
To resize: Choose Tools > Adjust Size, then enter the size you want to change the image to, then click OK
To crop: Click the "Select", then click and drag to select the area of the image that you want to retain. Next, choose Tools > Crop or press Command-K. If you crop too much, you can press Command-Z or choose Edit > Undo to undo the crop.

A: i use Skitch for simple image resizing and cropping. Saves tons of time. www.skitch.com
