Q: Is there an easy way to remove an app from iTunes and all iOS devices? We have 2 iPhones and 2 iPads synced to iTunes. It seems that to delete an app, I need to delete it from all devices individually and iTunes - i.e. 5 deletes. Is there a better way to do this?

A: Not sure which iTunes version you have installed but as of 10.2, once I deleted an app from the app list in iTunes, the app is deleted from all iOS devices the next time they're connected and synced.
