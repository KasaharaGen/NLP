Q: Hit a key to "move and resize active window" I'd like to bind a key to an action that "takes the active windows and moves it to screen S, coordinates X,Y resizes it W,H". The S,X,Y,W,H variables can be hard-coded.
I don't know where to look for, is this doable? Do I need to mess with ActionScript or create an app or what?
(I'm a programmer but I don't know anything about programming/scripting for OS X)
Update:
I found out SizeUp which happily does exactly that:


*

*a single keystroke, to resize the active window to a pixel specified layout


Now, while I'm happy about that, I'd like to know if there was a program which allowed more than one layout (SizeUp allows only one if I'm not mistaken). It would still have to be single-keystroke and possible to insert pixel precise values.

A: I use a little app called Divvy to do this. You can set up a global hotkey to bring up Divvy. And then within Divvy you can set up hotkeys that will snap the current window to a specific location and a specific size. It's great for quickly doing 2-up Finder windows for copying things back and forth. Or a Finder window on the left and a CyberDuck window on the right for remote copies. One of those apps that, when it's not on a Mac, will make it feel a little bit broken.

A: set a to path to frontmost application as text
tell application "Finder"
    set {0, 0, dtw, dth} to bounds of window of desktop
end tell
try
    tell application a to tell window 1
        set bounds to {0, 22, dtw / 2, dth}
    end tell
end try
The behavior with multiple displays is pretty confusing: Daring Fireball: Getting the Size of Your Display With AppleScript, the Lazy Way.
You can assign a shortcut for running it with for example FastScripts, Apptivate, Quicksilver or by making a service with Automator.
