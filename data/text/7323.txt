Q: What software has the features I need to replace Skype? For the past few years Skype has been getting progressively worse with each iteration. Skype 5 moved away from the compact 2.X era interface to an interface that's much more wasteful and less usable. Features like videoconferencing went paid-only, and now the latest betas are integrating with Facebook and have ads.
I've been on the fence a while regarding Skype; for all its faults it still is useful, but I've gotten to the point where I don't like the direction the software is taking and I'm looking into potential replacements.
The following is a list of Skype features that I use; I'm looking for a set of software/services that will cover most of these:


*

*audio calling

*video calling

*audio conferencing

*video conferencing

*Mac client

*iOS client

*Windows client (for family without Macs/iOS devices)

*calling phone numbers

*call recording (I use Ecamm's CallRecorder for Skype)


There are other features, like chatting, sending files, SkypeIn, and voicemail, but the above features are the ones I need. Any suggestions?

A: At the moment, I am sticking with uninstalling "new Skype" and going back to the old Skype.
But, VBuzzer is also a very good choice. They are based on open standards and can do most of the above, including video conferencing without a download (i.e.; in browser). (No Skype-in type number though). They also have mobile applications for both iOS and Android.
Google Voice + Gchat + Google Plus hangouts is always an option as well

A: Trillian would be my choice and it should hit all your requirements except perhaps the phone calling extension. (I haven't used it personally in a while)
Google voice isn't a shoe in replacement for that one aspect since it's not a true VOIP - but you might have to choose amongst your requirements. Skype has the pockets to hit all the points you mention and I don't see anyone else with the pockets to do all those clients with all those features. Perhaps if others get fed up with Skype, another service will pop up that is reasonably priced so as not to need to be ad supported.

A: I use iChat wherever possible - not nearly as ubiquitous as Skype but the tight OS integration, stability, performance, and no ads should make it at least a consideration.
If you can use AOL IM accounts on both ends you'll get screen sharing and video.  If you control your own network you could also investigate setting up Jabber, Spark or similar and creating your own accounts.

A: Nimbuzz
