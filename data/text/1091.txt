Q: How do I move my menubar to an external monitor? I just asked this question (Using External Monitor and Spaces. Want Mouse to move Up/Down, not Left/Right?) and @calavera gave me a great answer, thanks!  
But now I have another question. It seems that the menubar wants to stay with the laptop and doesn't seem to be possible to move to the external monitor. Am I beating a dead horse here or is it somehow possible to achieve the layout I'm looking for? See screenshot:

A: SecondBar is also an excellent free app that will add a second menu bar on the other monitor.

A: Try and drag the menubar icon you're pointing to in that screenshot to the other monitor.  It's kind of hard to grab with the mouse pointer but it should work if you can click/drag that white space rather than the blue space representing the monitor.
