Q: iMac 2011 - two external monitors I have an iMac from 2011 and there is already one external monitor connected via minidisplay port to dvi adapter. Today I wanted to connect another one, as the iMac features 2 minidisplay/thunderbolt ports. I bought a second adapter and hoped it would work just as easy â€“ plug in and done. But the screen of that monitor stayed black, nothing happened at all. Do I need another adapter? Some additional software?

A: I believe you would like to take a look at this Endgadget link that explains (even with a video) what you need.
If you have two Thunderbolt ports (only the 27inch iMac), then those can support two external displays (confirmed by Apple, you can google that).
