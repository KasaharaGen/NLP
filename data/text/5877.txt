Q: Find which RAR file is bad I have a RAR I downloaded made up of multiple files. When trying to extract it, it tells me the data is incomplete, something bad with one of the files.
Considering I had to download multiple large files, is there a way to find out exactly which of the files I should re-download?

A: Look at MacPar deluxe it checks each part - and if the parts include .par files it can recover from some errors

A: UnRarX also has an option to test archives without extracting them.
