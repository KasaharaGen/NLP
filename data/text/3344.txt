Q: Can I take a still photo with my built-in webcam? I have a MacBook Pro at work, but am new to Macs and have never used the webcam outside of Skype. Is it possible to take a still photo with the webcam?

A: Check out /Applications/Photo Booth.app

A: You can with PhotoBooth. You can also use all kinds of crazy effects. I suggest trying this when you don't have any important appointments later. :)

A: Yes, use the Photo Booth application.

A: *
