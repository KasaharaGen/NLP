Q: Are iPhone sim cards locked specifically to the iPhone hardware? I've got an iPhone 3GS, on the UK network of O2
Can I take that sim card out, and put it into another mobile device (not iPhone) ? I don't have a spare device to try this hence asking here
More importantly, would the sim card actually work in a non-iPhone device or is it locked for iPhone usage only?
Thanks

A: No SIM card is locked to any phone. The SIM card will work in any unlocked device supporting the frequencies used by the carrier that issued the SIM card.
