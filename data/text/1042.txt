Q: I uninstalled an app. How do I get it back?

How can I find out which apps I have already downloaded on my iPhone? 

The knowledge base mentions that you get to reinstall the app for free... once you find it again on the store, which is no easy task. There are dozens of apps, all alike the one that was installed.
Is there a way to have a list of apps you have bought? At what point of the purchasing process does this dialog appear? Does a price tag appear for already purchased items? If so, does this message appear after you single tap on the price tag, or do you need to risk a double tap?


A: On iTunes, under iTunes Store > Account > Purchase History, you've got a list of all your iTunes Store purchases.
If you already bought an app, it still appears with the price on the Store. Last time I checked, I had to risk re-buying to see it was free since I already bought it.
Hope that helps!
