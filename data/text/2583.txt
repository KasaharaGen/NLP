Q: How to enable AirPrint on iPod Touch after iOS 4.2 Upgrade? I have an iPod Touch (Model MC086FD) and upgraded to iOS 4.2.1 - all works fine. But I do not find the AirPrint Software on the iPod. Can I install it? How do I make my iPod print (emails etc.) when connected by WLAN?
I have a MacBook Pro with 10.6.6 Syncing with the iPod using iTunes 10.2.1. The printer is a Samsung CLX-3175FN connected by network.
I have no Print button in the share menu. Also I tried AirPrint Activator to enable for my network printer. Nothing helped.

A: My iPod touch is an 3. generation 8GB model (Model MC086FD).  As I found, Multitasking is needed to use AirPrint! But multitasking is not available for this model - even iOS 4.2 installed!

A: AirPrint doesn't require an extra App. It works directly from the print-menu, if your printer has support for the feature.
Here's a list of supported printer's and other notes for AirPrint:
