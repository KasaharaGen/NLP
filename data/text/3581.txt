Q: Safari in Windows 7 64-bit won't start When I go to start Safari on Windows 7 64-bit, I get an error dialog box:
Your copy of Safari is missing important software resources. Please reinstall Safari.

I deleted the Apple Application Support and the Apple Software Update.  I refuse to have these two pieces installed. I do not need any program giving me support or auto updates.  Safari works just fine without them in XP.
Any way around this?

A: Are you sure you can get by without the Application Support app? Try reinstalling Safari and see if you still have the issue with Application Support installed. (Then, if you want, uninstall that and see if Safari still works.)
Since you don't have the updater installed, you should check regularly to see if there are new versions of Safari so you don't get hit with some known exploit.

A: Is it possible that your anti-virus software and/or a lack of proper administrator privileges is preventing Safari from being installed correctly?
Try disabling them temporarily and doing a re-install.

A: I managed to run Safari on Windows 10, just downloaded version 5.1 which works just perfect. The previous 5.0 didn't start at all with Your copy of Safari is missing important software resources. Please reinstall Safari.
