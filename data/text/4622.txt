Q: iPad 2 cannot connect to a Microsoft Exchange server with Outlook Web Access (OWA) I just bought an iPad 2 and wish to link to the Microsoft Exchange email server Outlook Web Access connection. Sadly even though all details are correct it still says that the details are unable to be verified and obviously can not load emails.
For the record i can successfully connect via OWA connection on browser.
Also I have been able to load calendar.
Also the Signature also seems to have been loaded.

A: iOS does not use Outlook Web Access for Exchange support, it uses ActiveSync. Summarized setup instructions from this Apple support article titled iOS: Setting up Exchange ActiveSync:


*

*Tap Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account > Microsoft Exchange

*Enter the information in the fields shown, then hit Next

*Your iOS device will now try to locate your Exchange server. If necessary, you will need to enter your front-end Exchange server's complete address in the Server field.

*Choose which content you would like to synchronize: Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. Tap Save when finished.


(See the linked support article for the screenshots provided by Apple.)

A: You should have the Microsoft Exchange Server administrator to enable Autodiscover in Outlook Web Access for the time it takes you to first authenticate your Mail program on your iPad. Afterwards the administrator can disable Auto-Discovery if it is deemed undesirable.
Apple's documentation for connecting to a Macintosh says the following. I'm assuming the same will apply to configuring the Mail app on an iPad.

Connecting to an Exchange Server
To connect a Mac to an Exchange server, you’ll need the following
  pieces of information from the server administrator:
  
  
*
  
*The fully qualified domain name for the organization’s Client
  Access    Server (CAS), typically expressed in the format:
  exchange01.example.com.
  
*The Exchange user name, which is generated by the administrator for
  each individual user.
  
*The Exchange password, which is also generated for each user. Once 
  you have the required information, you can either manually configure
  your Mac to use Exchange, or configure the Mac using the Exchange
  Autodiscover service, if it’s enabled.
Connect to an Exchange server with Autodiscover enabled:
The easiest way to set up Mail, Address Book, and iCal to access
  Exchange is the Exchange Autodiscover service. If this feature is
  enabled on the Exchange Server, simply open the Add Account pane in
  Mail on your Mac and enter your Exchange email address and password.
Mail uses the Autodiscover service in Exchange to obtain the relevant
  information and you can start using Exchange services immediately.
