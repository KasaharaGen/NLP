Q: Create random playlist of albums not recently played? Is there a way to create a smart playlist that consists of random albums and when I sync my iPod touch, will remove the music I just heard and replace it with new randomly chosen albums?
If not, is there anything close?  I'd like to play music in album order, hear complete albums and hear music I have not heard recently.
I'm on Windows, so Mac plugins wouldn't work.

A: Perhaps something like this
