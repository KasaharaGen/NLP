Q: How do you connect an Apple TV to a wireless connection that requires a password after connecting? The wireless router I'm connecting to does not have any encryption.  If you log in from a computer and open a browser, you are prompted with a password request.
How do you access this type of network from an Apple TV?
EDIT: I don't have access to the router or a wired connection; the router belongs to the condo.
