Q: PC to Mac - Remote Desktop I want to connect to my mac remotely from my Windows PC. What good products are there available that you recommend checking out?

A: I've tried them all and RealVNC is the best by far. Anything else either lacks important functionality or lags miserably. I recommend you try them all though and decide for yourself; it really comes down to what level of remote control you're looking to have.

A: This is a full list I found on Wikipedia comparing remote desktop software.

A: VNC
Recent versions of Mac OS X include a VNC server built-in, analogous to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Server (included in Windows). This can be accessed via the System Preferences > Sharing > Apple Remote Desktop option.
There are various free VNC clients available for Windows, most notably RealVNC.
While there are other options, VNC benefits from being a very mature graphical remote-access protocol with official support from Apple and good-quality client programs.

A: For quick helpdesk applications I use Teamviewer (https://www.teamviewer.com/)

A: I highly recommend LogMeIn.  It is the fastest remote access program to Mac I've tested.

A: I'm currently using TightVNC to do the same thing.  Lately it has started randomly dropping my connections though.  I can get them back easily enough, but it's very annoying.  Started with the OS X 10.8.1 update so I'm not sure if it's TightVNC or OS X that's got the problem.
