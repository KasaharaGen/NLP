Q: How do I restore the audio balance to default? On my iPod Touch, I was playing around with the audio balance setting (settings -> general -> accessibility)
How can I reset the balance setting so that it is precisely at the midpoint (i.e. the default)?


A: It should automatically snap to midpoint if you manually move it there.

A: An alternative solution:

*

*Try you best to move the silder to center.

*Grab /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Accessibility.plist by either jailbreaking or making backup.

*Find the item named MasterStereoBalance. If not found or it's value equals 0, then it was perfectly at the middle. If not, restart from step 1.
