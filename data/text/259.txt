Q: Is there a way to make my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard hibernate with a keyboard shortcut? Is there a way to hibernate at all?
I know if the battery dies when it's sleeping it hibernates, but is there a way to go directly to hibernate with a keyboard shortcut?

A: Option-Command-Eject is the system-standard key to put the machine to sleep.
If you want to do more than sleep, you can use this preference pane to fine-tune the sleep or hibernate behavior: http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html
