Best app to switch between all open windows (Witch alternatives) 

In Microsoft Windows Alt+Tab combination switches between all windows from all applications. In Mac, Cmd+Tab only switches between applications, and when you want to switch between windows in single application, you have to use Cmd+`. I'm used to Windows behavior and I like it more. Is it possible to configure Cmd+Tab to switch between all windows from all applications?

A: There is no built-in way to do it, but Expos√© (Wikipedia link) is pretty good.
Alternatively there are some third-party apps which are might help.
