Q: Wifi stops working on Macbook Pro (Lion) 
Possible Duplicate:
Internet stops working frequently on OS X Lion 

Just bought Macbook pro 2011 running on Lion. I connect to my WiFi, but it has started happening frequently that internet stops working even though my DSL modem and wifi router are ON and working perfectly, as I acess it via my phone also. But on mac, no internet. To fix it either I need to restart the machine or turn wifi OFF and then ON.
Is this issue common on OS Lion?
any solutions?
Thanks
