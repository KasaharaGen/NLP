Q: How can I watch an AVI file on my iPhone? I understand that the bundled apps for iPhone does not support AVI files. However, I have lots of these files which I want to watch on my iPhone. 
Can you suggest a streamlined, automatic way of doing this? I have never watched videos on my iPhone or iTunes before and would appreciate step by step answers.

A: Use HandBrake to easily convert the AVI files to an iPhone compatible format then sync those converted files with your iPhone
Or, email/post them to Posterous, and they'll be auto-converted into a format watchable on your iPhone

A: There are plenty of apps which will allow your iPhone to support .avi files...
For starters, there is the all-time favorite VLC (free) . You get the file-support and the friendly user interface like you're used to on your Mac.
Then there is AcePlayer ($2.99) which will even support more files, is extremely user friendly and this app is close to my favorite.
But my all time favorite app is CineX-Player ($1.99). 
They tend to do some actions where you can get this app with a discount (or even free).
All of these apps are easily managed by iTunes File Sharing:    

They all support a lot of files (including your requested .avi), subtitles and they all have a nice and clear interface. I can highly recommend CineX-Player, but VLC is great as well and it's free!

A: Quicktime will do this too: File â†’ Save as and then choose iPhone from the format list.

A: There are a lot of apps that support this. The best I've found is yxplayer in the app store or yxflash from Cydia (same thing for free, but requires jailbreak) -- good compatability, fast with non-HD content, etc. You can move the files over using either iTunes or any program that let's you access the filesystem like iPhoneBrowser, then watch them without the need for any conversions.
Conversion is not a good option:


*

*Slow (often about 2/3 the length of the video, so you need to plan ahead)

*Lossy (you will lose quality)

*Larger files (usually)

*Generally a pain in the ass


If you must convert, HandBrake (like the accepted answer suggests) is good but doesn't support all formats - xvid4psp in my experience is slightly better.
If you want to convert MKV files with embedded ASS/SSA subtitles (having spent >5 hours looking for a program that will work for this), version 4 of xvid4psp (doesn't work on Win7 x64) is the only program that will do this. v5/v6 of xvid4psp, HandBrake, etc, etc. will not work.

A: Buzzplayer from the App Store plays AVI files and even embeds srt subtitles.

A: I'm a big fan of flex:player for iPad, iPhone (3GS and above), and iPod touch (3rd gen. and above).
flex:player will play the AVI file without conversion. You simply have to transfer the file.

To transfer the AVI file, you can use iTunes file sharing.

Bear in mind that, depending on your device, you might experience stuttering if the video is HD. The iPhone 4 and above should be able to handle 720p content just fine, though.

A: I suggest  VLC for iOS. AVI is a "container" for many different video formats (codecs). VLC could be a good viewer for many of the different video formats that AVI supports. When starting the VLC for the first time it has a good wizard that tells you what to do step by step.
This is a brief step by step way of doing it:

*Connect your phone to your computer

*Open iTunes on your computer

*Select the iPhone icon

*Select Apps Scroll down to File Sharing
