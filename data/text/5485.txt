Q: How to navigate iTunes with the Apple IR Remote With the death of Front Row, I need an alternative 10' interface to iTunes.  My IR Remote will let me pause/play the current media, and of course the volume.  But I can't seem to navigate the library with nothing but the IR remote.
I know I can use the Remote software on an Touch / iPad, but it 10x the price of an IR remote, you're kidding right?

A: You could try an app like Plex. It has a music component and is designed to be operated by a remote.

A: I just want to tell you that you don't have to miss Front row at least for now, because as far as I know you still can run Front row with Lion by copying these files from your Snow Leopard to Lion
/System/Library/CoreServices/Front Row.app
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackRow.framework
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/iPhotoAccess.framework
/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.RemoteUI.plist
/Applications/Front Row.app
