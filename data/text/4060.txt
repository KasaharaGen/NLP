Q: Dock Notifications Displaying Odd Red Icons Instead Having an odd issue. My dock is showing these strange red icons where normal numerical notifications should be. For example, Thunderbird will display a 3 when I have 3 new messages, but instead it is showing this red A? icon. This happens with all the apps in my dock that display a notification. 
See attached screen shot:

Notice the Thunderbird icon at the top and the Printer icon at the bottom.
Anyway to get my standard notifications back?

A: This looks like it might be a problem with a system font.  Try this...


*

*Open Font Book (in /Applications)

*Select the "All Fonts" collection in the left-hand pane

*Click any font in the right-hand pane to focus that pane

*Select all the fonts using Edit -> Select All or Cmd+A

*In the File menu, click "Validate Fonts"


If any fonts are corrupt, this method should alert you to the problem.
