Q: Mute specific program Is there any way to mute a specific program? I want to be able to mute Firefox.

A: Here an answer from our friends over at SuperUser.
TL;DR: You can, but only with some extra software. They suggest AudioHijack Pro

A: AudioHijack is the only software I've found that can route application sound. If you are looking to capture/block sound from Chrome/Chromium you are out of luck though. AHP cannot handle that software yet due to the way Chrome's processes are spawned on the fly.
