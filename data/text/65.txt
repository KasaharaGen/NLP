Q: Is it possible to launch a program in a specific language? I'm a developer, and my primary language is French, so I use Mac OS X in French. However, I need on a regular basis to open an application in English to do support.
Right now I'm going to the International System Preferences and I put English above in the languages list, then I open the app I need to run in English. When I'm done, I switch it back to French.
This is an annoying process. Is there something else I can use, like a command-line program, to launch an application in a specific language?

A: You can change the language inside the preferences file of the application :
defaults write com.apple.TextEdit AppleLanguages '("en-US")'

Or just run once one application with another language :
/Applications/iCal.app/Contents/MacOS/iCal -AppleLanguages '(de)'


To determine the bundle identifier, run
mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier /Applications/Mail.app

or directly in one command:
defaults write $(mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -raw /Applications/Mail.app) AppleLanguages '("en-UK")'

A: There is a freeware, Language Switcher, to launch a single application with a different languages.
it's really simple and work amazingly.

A: Go to the app, Press Command + I and if there are other languages they will show up in the info page. Just untick all except the language you want

A: For Google Chrome do this:
defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleLanguages '("en-US")'


A: I also found this to work:

bash-3.2$ LANG=de.UTF-8
bash-3.2$ /Applications/MuseScore\ 3.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore 



A: In the Finder, get info on the application. There are languages here, and you can choose. Alas, this seems to have disappeared in Snow Leopard.
