Q: What port does Skype for iPhone use? I want to set up Skype to have priority on my router whem I'm skyping from my iPhone, but I can't figure out which port the app uses.
Any ideas?

A: It seems that it's port 80 and port 443.  See this article on blocking of Skype 3G traffic

A: Skype and firewalls

Ideally, outgoing TCP connections to
  all ports (1.65535) should be opened.
  This option results in Skype working
  most reliably. This is only necessary
  for your Skype connection to be able
  to connect to the Skype network and
  will not make your network any less
  secure.
