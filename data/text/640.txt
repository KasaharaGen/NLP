Q: 8 GB on MacBook Pro (13", 2.26 ghz) The Apple specs say the 13" MacBook Pro supports up to 8GB of RAM. I have a 2.26GHz 13" one, and would really want to use this.
Has anyone tried this before? What is the maximum memory recommended, to be "safe"?

A: I have a 2.4-GHz 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is virtually the same as your model. It has 8GB of RAM. No problems thus far.
