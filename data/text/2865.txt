Q: is there free OS X equivalent to Total Commander? is there free equivalent to Total Commander for OSX?


*

*two panels

*drag & drop 

*tabs

*etc ect


I found DoubleCommander the best but OSX port has its bugs. muCommander is nice too but not as good as DoubleCommnader.

A: TotalFinder became a commercial solution not long ago: the full beta development stage was free and gave me plenty of time to test the software. It's an excellent solution, and I have seen almost every single bug disappear progressively.
Even if not a free solution anymore, its source is available on GitHub. I would recommend it on the grounds that it already works wonderfully well, and definitely deserve some support in my (otherwise freeware-oriented) opinion.
If freeware is yet a compulsory feature for you, Geekosaur's link has a few options.
Edit, 2013-01-07: as mentioned in another answer, XtraFinder looks like TotalFinder, but free.

A: Try XtraFinder. Is like TotalFinder, but it's free

A: I am satisfied with Forklift. Although it costs $20 after trial period, it is a simple yet powerful replacement of Finder/Total Commander.
What I value the most over other alternatives: 


*

*Simple and clear UI: power is under the hood

*Easy switch between 1 or 2 panels (mostly I use only one)

*Option to setup shortcuts: Enter to open file, backspace to move up

*Regular Expression for filters

*Renaming multiple files

*Sync folder: showing added/deleted/modified files

*WebDav is much faster then in Finder


See http://www.binarynights.com for all features and screenshot. 

A: Path Finder or TotalFinder, perhaps?  (Both are commercial.)

A: I'm writing an app similar to total commander, Mover - http://themaninhat.com/mover

A: You should probably take a look at Disk Order. It was created as a Total Commander equivalent for OS X. http://likemac.ru/english
However it's not free either...

A: DCommander is a good alternative but it is not free.
See http://www.devstorm-apps.com/dcommander-mac/ or itunes directly: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dcommander/id583622672?mt=12

A: FastCommander supports all file operations. Fast, stable, small, lightweight.
Can be freely downloaded and used - no restrictions, just nag screen.
