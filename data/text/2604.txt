Q: How to open FrameMaker files on a Mac with OS X? I have some old FrameMaker documents on my Mac (Intel Core Duo, OS X 1.6.6). Is there any way to open this files (readonly would be ok)? I cannot use the FrameMaker 10 trial from Adobe, because it is windows only. There has been a reader/viewer app in the past but I cannot find it anywhere.
There are two file formats:


*

**.mif is Maker Interchange Format (an XML dialect)

**.fm is FrameMaker binary


A: Adobe provides an online pdf creator which they state handles FrameMaker files.
However, it costs $10 a month to use it, but it might be worth a shot. (Albeit, you may convert 5 files to pdfs before you have to pay).

A: Find a friend with a Windows system and get them to download the (fully functional) 30-day trial.
Or, set up Bootcamp/Parallels and do the same on your system.
