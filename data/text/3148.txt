Q: Change Snow Leopard System Font Color This seems like it should be simple, but I've googled and gooled and still can't find an answer.
How can I change the System font color on Mac OS X 10.6.7?

A: Apple removed official support for "skinning" Mac OS X aeons ago. The only changes that you can make easily involve installing new icon sets.
There is no way to do this short of hacking binary files.
