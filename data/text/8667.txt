Q: Clearing TEMP files on Mac OSX I'm sure that my Mac is filled with crap by now, being 2 years old. Is there an app that will clear the temp files away? Or is there a list of locations filled with TEMP stuff I can safely delete without killing my Mac?

A: I tried the Beta of CCleaner, and it cleared out 10 GB of stuff, 7GB from the Trash. It's free and worked great

A: Y u no use OnyX? Free and really popular with really quick updates for every edition of OS X. It has a great feature set and works great for fixing corrupted temp files/caches
