Q: iPhone home button no longer works Recently I dropped my iPhone, breaking the screen, so I had that replaced with a new screen by myself that I brought from Amazon.
Now that I replaced it, the iPhone home button doesn't work at all because when I press it, it doesn't do anything, no matter how hard or many times I press it, it still won't do anything.
Later on, I took apart the iPhone and replaced the home button with a new one, and this didn't solve the issue and yet I don't know why it doesn't work at all.
I have pictures of my iPhone 3GS, hopefully it should help or whatsoever.
How can I get the home button working again?




A: If you can't fix the Home button mechanically, you can use a workaround to still be able to use your device, provided you have upgraded to iOS 5 or later.
Enable "Assistive Touch": Settings -> General -> Accessibility. It essentially shows a home button on the screen. A good way to breathe life into a broken phone.

A: Have you checked that when you re assembled the phone you lined up the positioning of the dock connector correctly, a tiny bit off and it will cause the home button to not work.
See this solution for removing the back of an iPhone 3GS for disassembly instructions. On step 29 you will see the importance of this components positioning.

A: This is probably a bit of a long shot given the distinct possibility of this being a hardware rather than a software issues (because of historical circumstances). Having said that, I did have this same problem with my iPad 2 (was convinced that there was an issue with the hardware) and this was rectified by a 'hard device reset'.
Have you tried this yet?
