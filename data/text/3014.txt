Q: How to move around with the mouse in a Web Clip Widget? I have created a Clip Web dashboard with a selection of a web site that shows a google maps with special spots. How can I move the map around in that widget ? 
The only thing I managed to do is to move the widget itself :-/

A: As I recall, Web Clip Widgets are 100% non-input interactive. They will show automatic changes/animations (javascript/AJAX fired events, animated GIFs, etc.), but they do not allow you to interact with the web page. Generally speaking, that would defeat the purpose.
