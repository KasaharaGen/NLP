Q: Permissions error when exporting slideshow as a movie in iPhoto I recently upgraded to Lion. 
Now when I try to export an iPhoto slideshow as a QuickTime movie it goes through the initial rendering process but an error message appears with the iPhoto logo saying that I don't have permission for this task. 

A: I've seen some people report issues with permissions and the desktop and/or other user folders. Try repair permissions with Disk Utility
