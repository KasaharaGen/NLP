Q: Can I control the shutter speed of a photo from an iPod Touch 4th gen? Is there a Camera app that will let me control the shutter speed of a 4th gen iPod Touch? Camera+ for some reason doesn't support this. 
Edit: I mean shutter speed, not exposure.

A: You can tap on an area of the picture you are taking to adjust the image settings (including the exposure) to that area of the image.

A: Photoshop Express has this feature.
Photoshop express is also free.

A: Threads like this one suggest that direct control of the "shutter" speed is impossible, as Apple have not released such controls in their API.
(Obviously, there's no actual shutter on the iPhone)
