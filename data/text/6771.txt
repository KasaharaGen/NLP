Q: Replacement plug on MagSafe adapter? The plug portion of my power adapter broke off. Fortunately, this piece of the adapter seems to just slide off of the main adapter body, attaching via a round metal piece. So basically I would just need to find a new plug assembly and slide it on.
Has anyone ever done this, or know where I could find such a replacement part? Can't find anything on Apple.com.
Here's an example of what my adapter looks like now:

It looks like this is intentionally replaceable for the purpose of international electrical socket compatibility, so you'd think it'd be easy to find a new plug piece... ?

A: If you take the "broken" piece in to the store (or call in to AppleCare) they can sell you a "replacement" piece as a "repair" part. Don't worry - it is a brand new piece, not something that is repaired. I think they cost around $10.
I don't think you can order just that piece - but it is included in the updated Apple World Travel Adapter Kit along with an iPad charger, USB cord and the worldwide plugs. This kit is $39 in the US.
