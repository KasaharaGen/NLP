Q: Selecting buttons with keyboard

How can I select buttons with just the keyboard? 

I have been using OS X for only a while now and am finding certain things a bit hard to do. Consider an option box shown below :-

Pressing an enter key would shut down the system, however how do I select the "restart" or the "cancel" options using they keyboard alone? Whats the keyboard shortcut for that? Arrow keys just dont work.
Coming from a Linux/Windows background, this is really confusing.

A: Use the Tab key to switch buttons then return to activate that. 
I think all GUIs I have used - Windows, OS X, X11, old Mac all have this.
