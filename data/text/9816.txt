Q: Annoying Text Glow I've hooked up my new Mac Mini to my 47" LG tv with an HDMI cable. Everything works fine, however there's one problem: I get this weird white glow around text (especially "os x native text") like this:

I set the output to 720p (the problem is even worse at 1080p).
Does anyone know how to fix this?
Thanks!

A: Check if your TV has a “sharpness” setting, and if so turn it all the way down. “Sharpness” is an image filter which can improve the appearance of weak analog signals or rescaled video, but it would produce the kind of bad result you are seeing.

A: For future readers: at least on Samsung TVs, you should try switching the display resolution and framerate to exactly what the TV supports. I.E. if the TV's native framerate is 60 fps then don't set the output to 50 fps in PAL mode but to 60 fps in NTSC.
Alternatively, set the framerate to half of what the TV supports, i.e. 30 fps for a 60 fps TV. This can be especially effective when using a graphics card that doesn't fully meet the requirements of the monitor.
Solved the problem completely for me, no need to adjust the sharpness.

A: Just got rid of the problem. I have got Philips 43PUS6501 and NVidia GT 730 2GB DDR5, both running on 4k/UHD. Everything was OK, except some yellow glow around text on white background (Clear Type turned off).
It's because the nVidia to run on 60Hz, forces output to CROMA 4:2:0, and that greatly impacts text sharpness. Lack of color depth can lead to muddy text on certain backgrounds. Switching to 30Hz on old HDMI cable turns down the amount of data that is sent over the cable by half. Remember, that running 4K/UHD@60Hz at 4:4:4 uses over 12Gbits of transfer, and the old HDMI cables run max 10.1Gbit.
The problem is that I have some old HDMI cable, it's v.1.4, but now the HDMI V.2.0 Cable is on it's way. :) Till then I set refresh rate in nVidia Control Panel from 60Hz to 30 Hz, and the glow is gone.
