Q: Where is the Xcode installer located? When I browse the Mac App Store, the buy button of the Xcode app is shown as "installed" so that I can't buy it. But I can't find it in my Applications folder either.
How can I locate the app? Or how can I change the "installed" button to "buy" button?

A: FYI, I had a similar problem but eventually noticed (via spotlight search for 'xcode') that rather than installing the actual app, it had downloaded an app in /Applications called, "Install XCode" which was 4.58 GB.
Running that does the actual install of XCode 4.

A: You could try inspecting the output of
$ pkgutil --pkgs

to see if any of the names look like the package that claims to be installed, then
$ pkgutil --pkg-info thatpackage

to see where it was installed.  If it's not actually found there, you could try
$ sudo pkgutil --forget thatpackage

and see if the App Store will let you re-download; but at that point I'd probably contact App Store support first, as mucking with the package database might cause bigger problems (like, conceivably, forgetting that you ever bought the program â€” although I would hope Apple's programmers were smarter than that).

A: Did you already have a non-App Store version of the app installed?  When I installed Opera from the App Store, it replaced my existing version of Opera, which I had not installed in Applications.
You can locate the app by using Spotlight.  Click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner of your screen and type the name of the application in.  Click "Show all", right-click on the application, and select "Open enclosing folder".
