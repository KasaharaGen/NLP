Q: Shutter count from NEF photo I know Nikon embeds the shutter count in the EXIF of their NEF raw files.
What's the easiest way to find it?

A: Just open the photo in Preview, press Command-I (⌘+I) to bring up the Inspector. Click the circled i (ⓘ) tab, and then the Exif tab. At the bottom of the list you'll find Image Number. 
This is your camera's shutter count.
