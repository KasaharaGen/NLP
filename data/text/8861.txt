Q: Is it possible to spell a word to Siri? Is it possible to spell a word to Siri? For instance, if I ask for the stock price of a certain company, she doesn't always understand the company name.

A: Actually you can. Try saying letter E  letter  F  Letter G and  so on.
Similarly, you can  also say  Numeral  five if you want to type 5.

A: You can say no caps on and no space on and then spell a word, letter by letter, followed by no caps off and no space off and Siri will understand that you spelt a word out for it to interpret.
You can see this in practice in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMNLV-qeou4
The context of the video is spelling words in Notes.app, so it's not clear if this works in all Siri contexts.

A: Try saying: "no caps on, no space on", then spell the word, then say "no caps off, no space off". 

A: Custom responses and informing Siri of specific words or spellings is not possible at the moment, but Apple itself has stressed that Siri is in beta status. That's not a label they use lightly, so I'd expect big improvements down the road.

A: It doesn't work reliably but there are a few commands for spelling things out in Siri.  Here's an article about it: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/20/how-to-type-comma-using-siri/
It sounds like some Dragon Dictate commands work.

A: I'm afraid that's not possible. You can't force Siri. At least, not yet.
