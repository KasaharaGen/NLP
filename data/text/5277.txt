Q: Can I reverse the two-finger scrolling direction in OS X Lion (10.7)? I just got 10.7. The two-finger scrolling direction seems wrong to me, although it says "direction - natural." I couldn't see a way to reverse it. Does anyone have a way yet?

A: Uncheck the box:

I found it unnatural, too, since they flipped it. I think they're going for consistency between iPads and mice.

A: Oh, found it: It's just the check-box, I thought that turned off two-finger scrolling, not the direction.

A: I have an older Mac, and the option to change this was unchecking the first option under trackpad: "When using gestures to scroll or navigate, move content in the direction of finger movement."
Maybe this new scrolling direction is better, but for now I have two Macs, and only one on Lion, so they need to be the same.

A: the option only available when i used magic mouse, my macbook was early 2008 model
