Q: Why does my iMac reboot every day at the same time? Every evening around 10:30, my iMac just stops and restarts. It's not a power outage because another iMac next to it (same plug) is not affected. 
I'm thinking maybe a service that's set to run at that time, but I don't see it just shutting down the computer with no warning ..

A: This is a shot in the dark but worth checking, since it is so specific time wise, have you maybe by accident set up an automatic restart under the Energy Saver?
