Q: How do I roll back updates on my MBP? My MBP has been freezing every day, and extremely slow ever since the last 10.6.8 update. Is there a way to go back to when my laptop was usable? Sort of like in Windows where you can uninstall updates

A: Mac OS X does not have a feature like Windows System Restore Points. Doing this sort of thing on a Mac is considerably more involved and problematic.
That being said, there are other options and workarounds for troubleshooting your system's performance and how to fix it. I'll have to leave that for another post.
Have you been using Time Machine to make complete backups of your Mac to an external hard drive, every hour, every day?

A: If you've ruled out other issues (HDD f/ex) and want to roll back to 10.6.7, the quickest way will be to re-install 10.6 followed by the 10.6.7 Combo update.
