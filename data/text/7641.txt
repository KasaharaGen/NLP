Q: Technical reason that 2011 MacBook Air is maxed at 4gb ram I am very interested in the MacBook Air specs and form factor. Both for reasons specific to my software needs (developing using an IDE as well as needing to run a virtual OS on top of the boot OS.) as well as an example of state of the art system design. 
A maximum of 4gb ram is a deal breaker for me. Furthermore from a system architecture stance, this limit feels to me like I am stuck in 2006 with 32bit machines, even if there are not better alternatives in similar form factors. It is like almost there but not quite.
What are the technical reasons that the 2011 macbook air was limited at 4gb ram?

A: Space, ram is soldered onto the MB. So I see price v optimal RAM amount.

A: There is no technical reason for a 4 gb limit to RAM. 
Let's say the designers could buy RAM twice as dense (removing space constraints), and also assume power consumption is negligible. Perhaps with SSD storage and the current controllers / CPU / logic board - RAM past 4g doesn't provide much benefit. 
Without being privy to design, purchasing and test data we can't know with certainty, but often technical considerations make it easier to not add something even if pricing / availability allows it. 

As an analogy, some bike frames are suited for certain tasks. To reduce size and weight, velodrome track bikes lack items that are "deal-breakers" for someone that needs huge cargo capacity. If you need RAM, get a frame built to carry that load...
