Q: MySQL - installation from source failed on ./configure I'm following this How-to on installing MySQL on Snow Leopard but instead of using MySQL 5.1 I'm downloading the source for MySQL 5.5.11
so when I go into the source directory and run:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-extra-charsets=complex \
--enable-thread-safe-client --enable-local-infile --enable-shared \
--with-plugins=innobase

I get:
-bash: ./configure: No such file or directory

What am I missing? what am I doing wrong?

A: Why don't you install MySQL from the DMG image - it works.
BUT - I'm not able to start v5.5.11 after the install, so I'm back on v5.1.56. It should only be a problem when installed on Snow Leopard.

A: You've downloaded the binary version, not the source.
This is the reason that you're getting the config error.
:)
