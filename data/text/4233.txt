Q: Where are the Thunderbolt components? I've been looking around for a few weeks now and still dont see any Thunderbolt adapters, like a SATA/eSATA adapter or anything similar, is it still too soon ? i just havent seen anything on Newegg or anywhere else.

A: Check out Apple Thunderbolt Display:
http://www.apple.com/displays/
It's a Thunderbolt - Firefwire, USB, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt adapter.

A: Currently Thunderbolt is advanced hi tech Vapor Ware.
There are a few prototype external drives floating around but until I can physically plug something multiple Thunderbolt enabled devices (as promised) in to my MacBook Pro it doesn't exist.
I love my MacBook Pro but Apple mis-represented Thunderbolt in it's initial marketing.  The multi monitor display capability specs were removed from the website.
.


A: See the recent Computex event for information on that. Promise and LaCie demoed Thunderbolt-capable storage devices slated for a Summer release.
