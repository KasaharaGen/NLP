Q: Does Apple have an email address, or must one call or mail them? Does Apple have a customer service email address? I have checked their site, and I can only find phone numbers and a mailing address.

A: Although it's not listed anywhere on the site, support@apple.com is a valid email address - but it simply sends an automatic email back, and the address is not monitored.
You're better off with the many support options listed on their support site: http://www.apple.com/support/contact/
