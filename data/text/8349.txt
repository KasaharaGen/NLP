Q: How do I change streaming buffer size in iTunes 10.5? I want to change the buffering of streaming radio in iTunes 10.5.  Every help document I've found online says to go to Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced Tab.  I see no such buffer option there.  I'm running on Windows XP Service Pack 3.  

A: I recall seeing it there once upon a time.  It appears they've removed this option.
