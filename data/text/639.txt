Q: Switch between ringer and vibrate based on schedule? Certain times of the week I would like the phone to be on vibrate and other times of the week I want it to be on ringer.  I would like to setup a schedule for these changes to happen automatically.  Can this be done?  If not natively is there an app that can do this?

A: Auto Silent on Cydia (jailbreak).
