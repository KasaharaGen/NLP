Q: 2nd Gen iPod (iOS4.x) using iPod keyboard Does anyone tried cramming a second gen iPod touch with iOS4 into the iPad keyboard sold by apple?  I've seen this but I'm not sure what the difference in architecture is between the iPhone that the Wired article is talking about and the iPod that I own.  

A: The original article by Andy Ihnatko can be found here: The iPad Keyboard Dock works with the iPhone 3GS! According to one of the commenters there:

The iPad keyboard dock also works with my iPod touch 2G (8GB) running iOS4. Great!

But personally, I'm not sure how or why this would be a better solution than a Bluetooth keyboard.
