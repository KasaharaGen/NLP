Q: How do I get Xcode 4.1 running under Snow Leopard? I'm trying to upgrade to xcode 4.1, but I it's not working as I expect. I am a registered iOS developer, so I downloaded the (huge) installer. When I double click, it appears to launch, but then it stalls -- nothing happens. There's no installer window with buttons to click, etc. I'm sure there's a better way to do the installation from the terminal and see what's really happening. What do I try next?
Also, I'm wondering if anyone has made this work with OSX 10.6.8 yet, as there were some descriptions of the installer crashing on the dev forums. No answers there as of yesterday.
Update: tried so far--
 Note: This is the correct version of xcode 4.1 for 10.6 (snow leopard) Not the one from the mac store, which is only for 10.7.

*I removed the previous version of xcode (was 3.2.5) using /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all. 

*Looking at the syslog, I see a couple of errors that might be causing trouble: Firstly, when I shut down last night it shows Macintosh DirectoryService[11]: BUG in libdispatch: 10K549 - 1960 - 0x10004004. Secondly, this is showing up repeatedly: Macintosh com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.SystemStarter): Failed to count the number of files in "/System/Library/StartupItems": No such file or directory

*When I tried the installer again, the syslog reported the above no such file or directory several times, then Macintosh com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[93] (com.apple.coreservices.uiagent[230]): Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault and a crash report.
Perhaps something is corrupted in my /System/Library files that is causing it to choke. Any other ideas on suggestions on how to repair this?
Update 2: I never managed to install xcode 4 on my macBook. The root of the problem seems to be that this was one of the earliest models of macBook to use the Intel processor. And XCode 4 doesn't seem to run well on this processor. Someone may have found a work-around by now, but I ended up with a newer computer: late 2009 MacBook Air running Snow Leopard. No problems with xcode 4 installation. 
Crash Report stuff: (hopefully the useful bits...)

A: I'd use Xcode 4.2, as it's the last supported version of Xcode on Snow Leopard.  It can still be downloaded from developer.apple.com.

A: Per Wikipedia, there were two releases of 4.1. One was introduced with OS X Lion, and another was released for Snow Leopard. Perhaps the Lion release requires Lion, and perhaps that's the one you have. I'm not sure how you could tell the difference.

A: I'm using version 3.2.6 (1761) with no problems. Might be an option for you.

A: Try removing the previous version of XCode first (there's an uninstall script in the Dev tools folder), then run the installer. For some bizarre and unknown reason it can get stuck trying to replace the previous version. 
If that doesn't work dig into your syslog and see if it's throwing any errors and post back and we'll see if there's something weird going on.
