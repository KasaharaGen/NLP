Q: Quicksilver accessible script for disabling and enabling Time Machine? I'd like to disable and enable Time Machine at will via Quicksilver.
'nuff said.
Do you're thang, nerds. :)

A: Just realized I could copy it out of another script I use to detect displays.
Here they are:
Disable:
tell application "System Preferences" to activate
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "System Preferences"
                click menu item "Time Machine" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
                tell button "OFF" of window 1 to click
        end tell
    end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit

Enable:
tell application "System Preferences" to activate
tell application "System Events"
        tell process "System Preferences"
                click menu item "Time Machine" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
                tell button "ON" of window 1 to click
        end tell
end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit

Hope that helps someone else. If there's a better solution, I'm all ears!

A: You can also use this AppleScript to start a Time Machine backup:
do shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper &"

or use a similar shell script.
I think Time Machine runs way too often.  Instead, I leave Time Machine disabled and use Awaken to run this script twice daily.

A: I'm using TimeMachineEditor for modifying the schedule
