Q: Map keyboard key to unix command Simple I am looking for a way to map a keyboard key to a unix command. It could be as simple as literal as opening up terminal and pasting a required bit of text. 

A: You could use a tool like Keyboard Maestro but it might be a bit overkill. 
If you just want to execute a command in Terminal and close the window again:


*

*Put command in a shell script

*Make it executable (chmod +x ...)

*Move shell script to a convenient place (e.g. our Desktop)

*run shell script/command by double click


A: Automator has a "Run Shell Script" action.


*

*Open Automator and create to new Quick Action

*Search for shell in the actions menu

*Drag "Run Shell Script" to the right panel

*Save as "Run Unix command"

*Open Keyboard and go to Shortcuts

*Scroll to "Services" and scroll to the bottom

*Bind "Run Unix command" to whatever you want.
