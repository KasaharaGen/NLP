Q: How to remove non-essential files from Leopard I am cleaning up a really old mac to bring it back to use. It has an 80 gig hard drive and after wiping out downloads, documents, pictures, music, videos and unneccesary applications I am now stranded at about 48 gigs. I read that Leopard needs about 9 gigs, how do I get rid of the remaining 20 gb without reinstalling. Its been three and half years since I bought it and I could only find Part 2 of the recovery disk. (I have already gotten rid of iLife, iTunes, iWorks, Web Browsers, Printer Drivers etc as I need only terminal based facilities such as lynx and vi.) If anyone could point me to solutions for freeing up as much space as I can it'd be very helpful. 

A: You can use Monolingual to trim the locales you don't require. This should trim at least a couple of GB.
The printer drivers are located in /Library/Printers. You can delete everything within the Printers directory (note, do not touch the /System/Library/Printers/ directory).
Additionally, if it's a default install, it may have come with iLife. GarageBand loops also take up a few GB and are located in /Library/Application Support/Garageband/Apple Loops/.
There are other areas you can trim space, but those will net the biggest gains. You can also give programs like DaisyDisk a shot (or free equivalent). They'll show you how data is distributed on your hard drive, and allow you to further pinpoint cruft that can be removed.
