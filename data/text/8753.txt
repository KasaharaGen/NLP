Q: iTunes - access to music and apps per country Does access to iTunes from a particular country, mean that iPhone apps are also accessable in that country?

A: Yes. Access to the iTunes music store using one Apple-ID means that you can also use its apps section. The ID is connected to a credit card, and the ID gives access to the store in the country to which that credit card belongs. Gift cards have been a trick in the past to work around that.
