Q: organising apps by multiple levels of folders possible? I like the idea of putting our apps in "folders" , but is there anyway we can furthur put those "folders" into "folders" ?

A: Not at this time. You cannot make a folder within a folder in iOS.

A: As a substitute, maybe use the pages of apps on the iphone.
