Q: Will I ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop? Does anyone know if I will ever spoil my iPhone by placing it on top of my laptop?
I mean I don't know about these electronic/magnetic stuff and I want to know if there may be any problem putting them close together (especially when my laptop is running and heated)

A: Your iPhone will not spoil if placed on your laptop. Unless it is so hot that your iPhone warns you about its temperature.
Concerning the electronic/magnetic stuff, your laptop will not give out that much amount of stuff to spoil the iPhone, unless your laptop is a microwave.

A: Though it won't likely damage your laptop or phone, it's a general rule of thumb not to place two electronics on top of each other.
Will you spoil your phone at that moment? Very low chances. Will you ever spoil your phone by doing it? Very high chances.

A: If your laptop still includes a HDD, the risk might be higher for the laptop than the phone, especially if your iPhone is set to vibrate.
