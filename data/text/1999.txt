Q: Why is Google maps (the built-in app) so slow on the iPhone 4? My Google Maps app for iOS has gotten too slow to be useful at times.  It doesn't seem to be a bandwidth issue, as it even affects typing- there's often meaningful lag from when i type a letter until it appears.
I've tried a full restart.    Any ideas?

A: From a MacRumors.com forum post:

My problem: Typing on the Google Maps app was very slow, independent of network connection.
My solution: Apparently there are issues with the GPS multitasking. I went to Settings > General > Location Services. Notice you can toggle the GPS for each app. Apps using the GPS have a purple arrow next to the ON/OFF switch. I turned location services off for every other app with the purple arrow. I went back to the Google Maps application and everything worked well.
This might not work for everyone but it worked for me.


A: I had this problem. None of the suggested fixes worked. I deleted the app from my phone, then reloaded it. When asked about the app tracking my location, I opted for "Always" and the app has worked fine ever since.
