Q: Change the year of 500+ photos in iPhoto For quite some time I had my camera configured with the wrong year. How can I change the year portion of the date of 500+ photos in my iPhotos library?

A: In iPhoto '09 (or later, I believe)...


*

*Select all the photos with incorrect dates

*In the menu bar, select Photos -> Adjust Date and Time

*Modify the date to reflect the change you want -- for example, to shift all the photos forward one year, increment just the year part of the date by 1

*All the photos will be time-shifted by the relative change you specified
