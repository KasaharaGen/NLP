Q: what is the app for seeing text being typed on a messenger i know of a app which pops up a dialog at the top right corner of the screen, when a user in on skype and the other person is typing something.
this is not specific to skype, but for any messenger that is installed on the mac.
i know that the name of the app starts with c but i am not sure if the name is crawl or cawl or something else....
i would really appreciate if someone can help me.
thank you in advance.
