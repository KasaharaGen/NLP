Q: Can I disable the Lion animation when switching to/from fullscreen apps? In Lion there is an animation when switching to and from full screen applications. Full screen apps are great, especially on a 11" screen, but this animation is getting very annoying. Is there a way to turn off these animations?

A: There is, at least, a way to speed them up with a SIMBL bundle: http://www.yllier.net/SUFSA.html

A: No..for now there is no way to turn it off. I also want to turn to the annoying animations when a new window appears.

A: You can disable the system-wide animation for opening new windows in Lion.
