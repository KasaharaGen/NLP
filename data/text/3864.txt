Q: How can I set the screen refresh rate for a CRT VGA monitor in Leopard? I need to operate a CRT monitor in 100 Hz (1280 x 1024) on a Leopard Machine.
The same monitor was working fine on a Tiger machine in the mentioned range but I switched to Leopard and it does not show the 100 Hz option in the list any more (but I am sure the monitor can support it). 
Is there a way to manually modify the list?

A: This handy utility SwitchResX can give you the option to adjust your monitor settings.
There is also this utility (which I haven't tried/tested)

A: So far it seems that there is no way to do this. I ended up changing my Graphics card to solve the problem.
