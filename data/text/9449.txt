Q: MagSafe Power Cord soldering with Power Brick How can I solder power cord back as it was? Has anyone else had the same problem? I know that Apple hardware and peripherals are very hard to "open up", so maybe some of you know some tricks about it. My power adapter looks like this:


A: Messing with a line voltage components like transformers is a huge fire hazard. 
When these cords fail due to mechanical abrasion, it's common for other parts to melt or fray and I wouldn't trust myself to know if the repaired unit would be safe. I would worry the heat of soldering would do more damage to the cord close to the solder point. 
Have you already called Apple and had them check if that adapter can be exchanged?
