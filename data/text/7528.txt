Q: Installing OpenConnect, Cisco VPN alternative Has anyone had any luck installing openconnect on OS X? I have downloaded the source code but I can't figure out how to build it. 
The instructions on their website say to extract the code and run make, but doing so gives an error:
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.

My reasons for wanting this are:


*

*The current version of Cisco AnyConnect is incompatible with OS X Lion

*I'm interested in the idea of wrapping the vpn connection in a deployment shell script


A: Sorry; I forgot to update the web page when I switched to autoconf. I'll fix it.
Run ./configure and then make.
Why didn't you ask this on the mailing list though; I only happened to come across this question by pure chance.
It always confuses me when users ask questions about my software on random web fora instead of sending questions to me or the mailing list I specifically set up for them to use... :)

A: OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support AnyConnect SSL VPN from Cisco. Since then, it has been ported to support the Juniper SSL VPN which is now known as Pulse Connect Secure. 400-101 Dumps
OpenConnect is published under the GNU Lesser Public License, version 2.1.
Like vpnc, OpenConnect is not officially supported by Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks or Pulse Secure, nor is it associated in any way with them. Only happens to interoperate with your team.
