Q: How can I use iCloud to sync my contacts, while also syncing my contacts with Google? If you have Google contact syncing enabled in 10.7.1 or earlier, then upgrade to 10.7.2 and try to enable iCloud contact syncing, you will see the following dialog:

Is it possible to have both worlds?  I would like to sync with iCloud for my iOS/mac devices, but ALSO sync with google for my gmail/android devices.  This used to be possible with mobileme.

A: Doesn't look like this is presently possible.  Only way to get this to work is use Google Contacts as the main source, and then set OS X Address book to sync to Google, and use Google ActiveSync on the iPhone to also sync contacts with Google.

A: Well... I also want to use contacts from GMail. So... After reading that there was no solution, I came to a very simple solution: Don't use iCloud for contacts. Period.
Each Apple device can be setup to sync with GMail contacts - and that's it.
Works for me.

A: As for Contacts, the best solution, as of March 2012, is to:


*

*Google Contacts as the main source, you get backups for free without doing anything

*On OS X, configure the Address Book to sync to Google

*On iOS, configure Gmail as Exchange, not as Gmail (counter intuitive but that's the way!)


Keep iClould out of your contacts for some time, until Apple will include native support for Gmail contacts, which I doubt.

A: Ignoring iCloud and using Google's ActiveSync is not a solution which works for everyone. ActiveSync is limited in number of data entries in your address book which can be synced, and the name of these data entries. In short:


*

*3 email addresses

*2 home numbers

*1 home fax number

*1 mobile number

*1 pager number

*3 work number (one will be labeled 'Company Main')

*1 work fax number.


Numbers have to be named exactly as stated above. Other names like "Support" or "Hotline" won't be synced without displaying any errors.
See Google Sync Known Issues with iOS for more information.

A: Currently, doesn't seem possible.This website categorically says so.
