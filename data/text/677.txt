Q: How do I cancel a download in iTunes on the iPad? I have selected to download a few podcasts in iTunes on my iPad but have decided that I don't want them anymore (they're audio only and I would prefer to listen to them on my laptop instead). Is there any way of terminating/cancelling the download?
I have tried tapping, holding, and various other things in iTunes on the iPad but no luck.
Am I doomed to have to download the files and then delete them?
I ask because I'm in a country that does not have unmetered download internet plans.

A: you should be able to swipe from left to right along the item to get a delete button. The same way you used to have to delete on the iPhone before they added in multi-item delete.
