Q: Transfer video file from OS X Lion to iPod touch 4th gen with iOS 5 I have a recently purchased MacBook Pro with Lion and I want to transfer a video file to my iPod touch. The only problem is this is not the Mac with which my iPod touch library is synced, so I cannot really use iTunes sync feature. What can I do?

A: Air Sharing will provide a network drive the Mac can drop files onto so you can view them on your touch.

A: If you're looking for a workaround here, you might be able to use Dropbox. Store the file in your Dropbox account on your Mac, download the iOS client, and star the file as a favorite on your iPod touch. I believe that will cache it on the iPod touch. Then, when you click it, it should play.
You will need a wireless internet connection for the Touch on the first sync, but once it's starred as a favorite, it should be accessible even when offline.
