Q: Can I have a second menu bar on my secondary display? Is there software that will allow you to add a second menu bar to a secondary display? I am using Second Bar, but I was wondering if there was other software out there that would do this. Note that I don't want to move the menu bar. I know I can move the menu bar in System Preferences. This is not what I want. I want a second menu bar.

A: To the best of my knowledge, no there is not another app that currently provides the same functionality as Second Bar.
MenuEverywhere or DejaMenu provide other workarounds to make menu bar commands selectable elsewhere, but I am not aware of any other program that puts a menu bar on multiple monitors.

A: Multimon 
"adds a menubar to your second (or third, or so on) display and gives you hotkeys to quickly move windows from one monitor to another. You also get a menubar icon to click and move windows. When it does move windows, it automatically scales and resizes them for you to match the target monitor's resolution." - lifehacker
