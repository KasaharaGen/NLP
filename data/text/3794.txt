Q: Cannot start MySQL server with AppleScript - Snow Leopard I've sucessfully installed MySQL server (5.5.11) on my MAC Snow Leopard. I can start the server using PreferencePane, using command line sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe but cannot use the same command within AppleScript.
This is the output from running sudo /user/local/mysql/bin/mysql_safe:
ngocminh@MBP[304]:~$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe 
Password:
110428 09:52:03 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.err'.
110428 09:52:03 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data

Apache2 server can be started using the command sudo apachetl start, then it could be implemented using an AppleScript script like this:
do shell script "apachectl start" password "mypassword" user name "ngocminh" with administrator privileges

However, I can't simply do the same for starting mysql server
do shell script "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe" password "mypassword" user name "ngocminh" with administrator privileges

The apple script result says:
"110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.err'.
110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data
110428 11:03:06 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /usr/local/mysql/data/MBP.local.pid ended"

Then MySQL server cannot be started!
Would anybody tell what's wrong with my script or I've missed something. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thank you!
-- EDIT 1 --
Try to run this script instead
do shell script "apachectl start" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges do shell script "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe > /dev/null 2>&1 &" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges

No error reported by AppleScript but MySQL server is still not loaded according to ps command

-- EDIT 2-- PROBLEM SOLVED!
I found the way around it. Just creat an AppleScript with sudo inside for mysql server startup
do shell script "apachectl start" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges
do shell script "sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe > /dev/null 2>&1 &" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges

A: Have you tried something like this, starting from administrator?
do shell script "/sw/sbin/apachectl start" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges do shell script "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe > /dev/null 2>&1 &" password "mypassword" with administrator privileges
