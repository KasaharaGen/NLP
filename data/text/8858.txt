Q: How can I make my Terminal login as my mac account and now bootcamp partition? I recently installed windows 7 on a partition using bootcamp and all went well. Now i am trying to use terminal on my original mac partition on OSX but the command line comes up as:
myusername-Win7:~ username$
i am having trouble connecting to an ssh tunnel for lowering for WoW, could this be my problem as it looks like its using windows 7?

A: Look's like somehow your computer has had it's name changed.

Changing your Mac’s computer name:

*Launch System Preferences

*Type in what you want your Mac’s new computer name to be  

*Close System Preferences
