Q: What is the best way to use Gtalk on iphone? What is the best way to use Gtalk on iphone?

A: Since Google does a pretty good job of making their websites mobile-friendly, navigating to http://talkgadget.google.com/ and logging in should present you with a nice chatting interface.
On the iOS app side, imo seems to be a popular choice, though I can't personally vouch for it (the mobile web interface works fine for me when I'm away from a real computer)

A: For an app that can not only handle the IM features of Gtalk, but also the voice features, check out Talkatone.
Otherwise, there's too many iOS apps to list that can interface with Gtalk via their XMPP protocol, as well as accessing Google's web app via Mobile Safari.

A: I like to use an app called eBuddy http://www.ebuddy.com/ that I use for a Gtalk chat client. It also lets you use other chat clients like AIM and msn. There are many different apps out there that I am sure do the same thing but I really like eBuddy.
