Q: Publicly sharing an iCal calendar to allow web viewing When using iCal in Snow Leopard, I shared a calendar.
I had two options for this - either a privately shared, editable calendar, or a publicably shared, view-only calendar. I used the latter option, and was provided with two URLs - one of which allowed my friends and colleagues to subscribe (via their own iCal or other software) and the other of which was an ordinary web address, that allowed them to view my calendar in their web browser.
It's this latter type that I'm now trying to set up in iCloud, but I can't seem to find an option to do so - neither in iCloud itself nor on iCal running on Lion.
Any ideas, please?

A: In iCal, click the "Calendars" button in the upper-left corner, just under the traffic light. Right-click on the calendar you want to share, then select "Share Calendar..." This will open a new dialog, allowing the choice you mentioned between sharing read-only with everyone, or editable with invitees; make your selection and hit "Share".
Once the calendar is shared, again click the Calendar button and right-click the calendar you just shared, this time selecting "Copy URL to Clipboard".
(There's also a "Stop Sharing" option, in case you ever change your mind.)
