Q: How to use external mouse and keyboard normally in bootcamp with windows 7? I just installed windows 7 using bootcamp.
I then connected an external keyboard and mouse. I understand that I need to change settings in order to use right click on the trackpad. My problem is that my external mouse's right click does not even work.
How do I enable right click on my external mouse?
Thanks!
