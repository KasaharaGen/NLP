Q: Problem with iMac Apple Remote Recently, my Apple remote has stopped working from a distance of more than one meter. I thought maybe it was the battery, so I bought a new one, but nothing changed.
I thought I had broken the remote and could not pass a signal at a distance greater than one meter, but I did a test with my friend's Macbook and it works fine from this distance. So, I think that the problem could reside inside my iMac.
Does anyone know what's happening?

A: It is hard to say for sure without more information, but my first guess would be interference.
Do you have another piece of electrical equipment near your iMac that could be impacting the signal? Speakers? A wireless headset? A router?
In my new apartment whenever I get a phone call on my 2.4Ghz land-line telephone it drops my WiFi connection on my iMac so interference can definitely cause odd problems!
