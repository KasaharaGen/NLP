Q: Control draft saving in Apple Mail? Is it at all possible to change the time for saving drafts in Apple Mail? I use MobileMe and whenever I send an email, the draft doesn't get deleted automatically. I don't want to switch off saving of drafts, but would like to increase the time between saves. Since I don't need to save drafts for short emails.

A: If you go into Preferences, Accounts, select your account, then select the "Mailbox Behaviors" tab, there's an option to disable saving drafts on the server. I know you said you didn't want to disable saving of drafts, but this option will still save the draft on your computer, yet it won't mess up Mobile Me.
