Q: iVPN Connection Problems I want a way to create a secure connection to the internet (something I can trust) on my iPod Touch and Laptop through a source I can trust. In my research, it was suggested I use iVPN on my iMac at home to set up the connection. So I bought that and tried it out. The VPN client connects, but I cannot navigate to the internet. Any thoughts on how to fix it?

A: Doing so would require being able to access your iMac from remote places, thus configuring either a DMZ host, or port forwarding on your router. Either way it will be a headache. 
Also if you're on a residential connection note that the public IP address can and will change. I recommend a dynamic DNS server for that.  
Assuming you can get that all setup it's as simple as setting up VPN on your iDevice.
