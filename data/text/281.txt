Q: iPod 2nd Gen Replacement digitizer not working So I just ordered a new digitizer and middle frame for my 2nd Gen iPod Touch, wired everything up, and the digitizer is not recognizing any finger swipes.
I have not snapped the frame into place yet as I want to make sure I don't have to tear this thing apart again.  The video's I've watched show that the digitizer "should" work when not snapped in.
Is there anything I should be looking for before marking this new digitizer as defective?

A: Ended up ordering a new digitizer :-(

A: If you're sure that it's cable is in correctly and it doesn't come up after a hard reboot (hold power button, slide to off, turn on again) - chances are it is defective or not the the right type. Not sure about ipods but the digitizers on iphone generations are listed as not compatible on parts websites!
