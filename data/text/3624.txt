Q: How to revert OS X Snow Leopard default theme? Yesterday I tried to change my OS X default theme so I installed many themes one of them was Aqua Extreme. Non of them give me what I was looking for as a result I revert pack to default theme using ThemePark program but icons in the main menu lost its shadow. Is it possible to return pack to default theme settings?
Thanks

A: Aqua Extreme comes with a separate package called Remove Aqua Extreme which restores the default user interface.  
If you download the latest Aqua Extreme from http://www.maxthemes.com/downloads/Aqua%20Extreme.dmg
you will find the Remove Aqua Extreme package inside the installation bundle.
Run this package, it should restore everything.
