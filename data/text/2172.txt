Q: Bandwidth shaper or bandwidth controller application for Mac OS X I'm looking for a bandwidth/packet throttle/shaper program with the following features:


*

*Similar to Windows-based Netlimiter.

*GUI based and not terminal or command line.

*Shows list of all applications communicating over network its connections, transfer rates and more.

*Set download or upload transfer rate limits for applications, connections or groups of them. 


A: There are multiple ways to do this.
For example, using ipfw, pf, or trickle, or GUI front ends to these, such as:


*

*Speed Limit (not maintained as of 2014)

*Throttled (only 10.4.x - 10.8.x)

*Waterroof (10.7): http://www.hanynet.com/waterroof/

*IceFloor (10.8): http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/

A: For those on 10.7 or newer, the easiest solution to the bandwidth limiting part of the question is Apple's Network Link Conditioner (NLC), a free utility that was originally included with Xcode. Then Apple got all sandbox-happy, so now it's a separate download from Apple's developer web site, called the Additional Tools for Xcode.
The important points going for NLC are that it's from Apple, it's got a very straightforward UI, and it works. Some of the other suggestions given in other answers fail some or all of these criteria, particularly in failing to work on newer OSes.
As for monitoring per-application bandwidth usage, I recommend iStat Menus.

A: Since there wasn't a clear answer here.... somebody recommended vellum and that got me looking into it. Turns out velum gives you a license too their other product "snail" which is exactly what the post originally asked for.... so skip vellum just buy snail.

A: Charles Proxy
Limit the bandwidth and see requests, responses in real time. 
Charles Proxy has quite a nice GUI.

A: Waterroof or Noobproof, both free!!

A: take a look at little snitch: http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html
Little Snitch features real-time network monitoring. It started as a nice GUI for adding per-application access rules and has grown into a bandwidth tool as well. I don't know how to use it to shape bandwidth. It's mostly an all-or-nothing, accept/reject network access monitor.
Still, it will certainly help you find out which processes are spiking your Mac's network activity.


A: In 10.15 and above, try: Vallum
