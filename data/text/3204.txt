Q: Remove applications in virtual machine (via VMWare Fusion) from Open With options on Mac OS X I am running Windows 7 in a virtual machine. Now all of its applications are available via the Open With (or even as the default for some) on the Mac. I don't want them there. I've remapped the ones where it was the default, but it is still listed on the Open With menu. How can I remove all of them?
I have shared folders turned off.
I've seen this with Parallels too, and I thought I saw a option to turn it off, but I cannot find it. 

A: VMWare 3.1.2

A: If you are using VMWare 3.x, you can try the Steps mentioned in this Article from the VMWare-Community.
Additionally, you can trash the file "com.apple.LaunchServices.plist" found in ~/Library/Prefences. The List of Applications listed in the context-menu will be rebuild the next time you try to open a file via the context menu
