Q: For some reason I can't open files on drive I can't open the files on certain drive that is formatted as ntfs. I have Tuxera installed however. Here is an image on how they look:
The file with a lock is password protected as it should.

Any suggestions on how to fix this? For some reason the files I can't open are somehow transparent.

A: First thing, make sure that it's no locked and that you have the correct permissions :

If you have extended attributes you can get rid of those by doing the following :
1- Do ls -l@, under the file it will give you something like "com.apple.FinderInfo". Copy that
2- Do xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo path/to/file
If nothing works then your last option is to sudo it :
sudo open path/to/file
Also see if you can open it using a mac that those not have Tuxera installed on it.
