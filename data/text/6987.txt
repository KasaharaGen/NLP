Q: Automator simulation of the mouse and keyboard My problem: "watch me do" in automator only recognizes for cocoa buttons and doesn't work for apps like games with interfaces drawn my rendering engines.
Desired solution: an Automator action(s) that simulate mouse movements and clicks to coordinates on screen. "Automator Virtual Input" is a great app but doesn't is far outdated (doesn't work in lion)
And considering the amount of scripts i need to create, applescript isn't a time effective solution

A: You can automate a mouse click using Applescript.
tell application "System Events"
    tell application process "Application_Name"
        key code 53
        delay 1
        click (click at {1800, 1200})
    end tell
end tell


If you want to click within a browser window you can use Applescript with the help of Javascript
tell application "safari"
    activate
    do JavaScript "document.getElementById('element').click();"
end tell


Purely via terminal, you can create a textfile with the name click.m or whatever name you like, save it with the following code
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    NSUserDefaults *args = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

    int x = [args integerForKey:@"x"];
    int y = [args integerForKey:@"y"];

    CGPoint pt;
    pt.x = x;
    pt.y = y;

    CGPostMouseEvent( pt, 1, 1, 1 );
    CGPostMouseEvent( pt, 1, 1, 0 );

    [pool release];
    return 0;
}

then compile it:
gcc -o click click.m -framework ApplicationServices -framework Foundation

and move it to the appropriate system folder
sudo mv click /usr/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/click

and now you can run a simple terminal command to manipulate the mouse
click -x [coord] -y [coord]


Other scripts you could use include MouseTools or xdotool; both of which are open-source.

A: I think that you're trying to push Automator past the practical limits of the tool. Instead, a macro program such as Keyboard Maestro or iKey are better choices, albeit not free.

A: QuicKeys 4 provides the functionality your looking for.  They offer a free trial version as well as a paid version.  The free version has all the same features as the paid version, only it nags you that it is a trial.
QuicKeys, however, has not been updated in several years & has issues since Mountain Lion.
Some parts work, others fail; so I'd recommend a thorough test.
