Q: Block all sites except one I have been assigned the task of installing an iMac that is only allowed to use one specific site, and block access to all other IP addresses. The iMac will be on display at a resort so guests can fill in a questionnaire hosted on the resort website.
My questions are:


*

*How do I block all outgoing traffic except for traffic to IP xx.xx.xx.xx?

*Is it possible to set up a user account that is only allowed to use Safari? Or set it up so that a password is required to exit fullscreen mode? Or is there a better solution to set up a web page in fullscreen mode on an iMac and prevent the user from doing other tasks?


A: Check out Parental Control. This allows to restrict applications to run as well as web sites to visit.

Alternatively you can use ipfw to restrict IP/Internet access:
 sudo ipfw -f flush
 sudo ipfw add allow tcp from me to xx.xx.xx.xx
 sudo ipfw add allow ip from me to xx.xx.xx.xx
 sudo ipfw add deny tcp from me to any
 sudo ipfw add deny ip from me to any

To disable just run sudo ipfw flush again

A: You could check out Plainview. This is designed for kiosk style presentations, it's not a hardened security app. But it seems like it might work for your application.
