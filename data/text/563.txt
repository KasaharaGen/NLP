Q: How do I find out the MAC address of my iPad? I have a new iPad and MAC address filtering on my home wifi network. How do I figure out the MAC address of my iPad?

A: On my iPhone, I can find my MAC address by going into Settings, then General, then About. The wifi MAC address is listed under "Wi-Fi Address". It's likely that the MAC address for the iPad is in the same location.

A: As a slight aside, iNet Pro will show you the MAC address (and a lot more) of all devices on the network your iPhone is connected to.

A: The free app IPView shows:


*

*cellular IP

*Public IP

*Wifi IP

*Wifi MAC


addresses.
The UI is less than stunning, but it works fine.
