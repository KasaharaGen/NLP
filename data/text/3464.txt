Q: MySQL 5.5.11 "the installation failed" after removing old installation on Snow Leopard I had an old instalation of MySQL but it wasn't working very well, so I Googled how to completley remove it and found this:
http://tomkeur.net/39/how-to-remove-mysql-completely-mac-os-x-leopard.html
and then did:
sudo rm /usr/local/mysql
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM
sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*

And now I'm getting this on a new install:

I also ran these commands:
sudo rm /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/groups/_mysql.plist
sudo rm /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/_mysql.plist
sudo rm /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.mysql.bom
sudo rm /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.mysql..plist

Installer error Log Says:
Apr 13 00:18:31 nizzlesmymac installd[3203]:

A: You may try to remove manually everything again, and to create the mysql user by yourself using this guide.
Then try to perform the installation again.
