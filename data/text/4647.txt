Info about iCloud

A: Sync from iPhone to your computer, then from the computer to the iPad.

When I got my iPhone I was also able to transfer all data and apps from an iPod touch backup to it. Maybe you can do something similar with the iPad and an iPhone backup.

A: I would advise to directly transfer iPhone contacts to your iPad without the using the iCloud or iTunes.
The last time I tried to transfer my old iPhone contacts to my new iPhone via iTunes sync, it wiped clean my old iPhone - not a pleasant experience.

A: In iTunes, click your phone's name > Information tab > tick the box to sync contacts and choose Windows Contacts, then do the same process for your iPad and sync.

A: You can always sync your contacts with iTunes to your computer and then to your iPad.

If you're looking for a PC/Mac-less experience of transferring your contacts over, try iDrive Lite (App Store link here). It can backup and restore your contacts between devices using a free account.

A: Download an app called Bump to both devices. It uses Bluetooth to transfer stuff, you can tell it to transfer all contacts.

A: Copy Trans Contacts is software that will give u full control over your iPhone contacts.
It will allow u to back up all your iPhone contacts to a PC & then transfer those contacts to your iPad.

A: It's very simple.


*

*Download any iPhone Contact App from the AppStore on your iPad with same apple ID , (I downloaded the App Groups on my Ipad)

*import all your iPad contacts to that app

*Download the same app on your iPhone (depending on your settings, this might happen automatically)

*On your iPad contact app, there is an option to email your contacts. Send them via email from the iPad and open that mail on your iPhone.

*The e-mail will have an attachment; open that attachment on iPhone and add it to the contact app on your iPhone.

A: Export all your contacts of the old Phone in iCloud as one vCard, including all Contacts and send it as an email to your new Device.
