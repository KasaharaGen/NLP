Q: How do I make Terminal.app's scrollbars disappear in Lion? Once I upgraded to Lion, I found out that the vertical scrollbar is always plastered to the right side of the application window. 
Because I run GNU Screen within Terminal.app, the right side of the screen session gets hidden partially underneath said scrollbar. Likewise for emacs sessions.
Is there a way to disable scrollbars in Terminal.app in Lion?

A: I assume you're not using a trackpad, and/or your Show scroll bars preference in System Preferences > General is set to either Automatically based on input device or Always (otherwise, you shouldn't be seeing persistent scrollbars).
Try changing this setting for Terminal only:
defaults write com.apple.Terminal AppleShowScrollBars -string WhenScrolling

Then close Terminal and reopen it for the change to take effect.

A: System Preferences > General > Show scroll bars > When scrolling

A: Try LionScrollbars. It's the only thing that worked for me (besides setting the entire system to "When scrolling"). Works like a charm under 10.8.2.
