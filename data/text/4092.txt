Q: Cannot log into Workgroup Manager I recently reinstalled the Mac Mini Server using Snow Leopard-server, but using the account I created during setup (allegedly the server administrator account) I cannot authenticate to the LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 store.
Using the diradmin account I can get limited (cannot change anything) access (after waiting a long time) using the same password as the 'standard' admin account. Also, using the root account I can log in fine.
So, what am I missing here?

A: Aparently it does work if I use the 'root' account, don't know if that's even The Right Wayâ„¢, but it suffices for now.
