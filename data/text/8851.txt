Q: How do you get a printer's IP in lion? How did you find out an existing printer's IP in lion?
In Snow Leopard you can do it in this way:


*

*Open System Preferences

*Select the printer that you want to find the IP for

*Click 'Options & Supplies'

*The IP is shown next to the 'URL:' label, and might say 'lpd://192.168.0.50/'


How can you do this in OS X Lion?

A: Use the built-in CUPS web interface to get detailed printer information:
http://localhost:631/printers/
On newer versions of macOS you'll need to run the following command to enable the web interface:
cupsctl WebInterface=yes
