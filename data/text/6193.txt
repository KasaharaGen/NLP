Q: In Lion, how can I configure to not automatically re-open recent files that weren't closed? For example: I opened some files in Excel, then I close Excel, without close each file (ex.: command + Q). In the next time that I will open Excel, it is going to open my recent files that weren't closed.
Is there someway that I can change this behaviour? 
P.S.: This occurs with other apps too, for example "Preview".

A: If you're running Lion, this is a built-in feature called Resume.
To prevent apps like Preview/TextEdit/other apps that support Resume from "resuming", quit them with Cmd+Opt+Q.

A: You can disable the resume feature on a per-app basis as well. See the section titled "Stop Preview (or Other Apps) from Restoring Windows" at http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_tame_six_os_x_lion%E2%80%99s_early_problems
According to the article's author, the command line (to be executed in Terminal.app) to disable the resume functionality only for Preview is
defaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -int 0


A: System Preferences > General
Uncheck the Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps.

You can also toggle this behavior by holding the option key when quitting an application.

In Mountain Lion, this option has been changed to read, "Close windows when quitting an application" with fine print to explain that open documents will not be restored.
