Q: OS X: Is there an open source screen recorder? I need a screen recorder. However, I try to avoid using closed-source software whenever possible except from major vendors like Apple and Skype. 
I am wondering, is there an open source screen recorder for Mac OS X? 
Or if not, does Apple include such a thing with the OS? Or how about using Skype? I'm running Snow Leopard.

A: You've answered your own question, but I thought I would flesh it out a bit.  
You are correct that QuickTime will record a window, or the whole screen, but it only does so with the version of QT that ships with Lion. It wasn't available in earlier versions of QT or OS X (I'm not sure if the latest QT would do this on an older OS - I don't have one to try it on.)
I was pleasantly surprised to see that it now had that functionality - there really aren't any other free or low cost options.

A: Kap is a great option. Recently (January 3, 2017) they hit version 1.0.0.
Its great features include:


*

*Export to Gif, WebM, MP4

*Audio recording

*Hiding the mouse cursor and highlighting clicks

*Record a portion of your screen with a custom size and aspect ratio

*"High" FPS recording


A: VLC is an open source media player which also offers screen capture facilities (via File -> Open Capture Device..).

A: Open Broadcaster Software may be a reasonable option. The project appears to be open source and to support macOS:

OBS Studio
Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. Download and start streaming quickly and easily on Windows, Mac or Linux.


A: Open Source

*Jing is great for making screencasts and taking screenshots. There's a free version that does the job fine.

*QuickTime is capable and it comes with OS X.
