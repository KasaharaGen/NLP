Q: Wifi problem in OSX 10.7.1 after wake from sleep Basically it takes very long (sometimes up to 5 minutes) to reconnect to wifi after waking my Macbook Air (june '11 model) running OSX 10.7.1
It does show a list of available networks when I click the wifi icon and it does include the network I want to connect to, but it doesn't do anything if I click the network name.

A: Seems these issues will be fixed in 10.7.2â€”maybe you'll just have to wait a few more days until things will get back to normal.
