Q: Is it possible to purchase music on an iPhone without iTunes? Do any music stores beyond iTunes exist that allow you to legally purchase content on an iPhone? That is to say, is it possible to purchase music without connecting to a computer? Streaming or downloading are both ok.  Through an app or a website is also ok.

A: I haven't tried the service, it seems that Rhapsody does more or less what you are asking for -- a music store on the iPhone that is separate from iTunes.

A: I have used MOG on an iPod touch to download music from their library to my iPod Touch for offline listening.  As I understand the contract, I do not own the content, only the right to listen to it during my contract term.
