Q: Does a Magic Trackpad have a button? Does a Magic Trackpad have a button, as opposed to just being a trackpad? I am not sure if this even makes sense, so let me know if I need to clarify.

A: It doesn't have a "button" in the traditional sense, but clicking is supported in two ways:


*

*Pressing down anywhere on the trackpad engages a click mechanism in the base.

*Lightly tapping on the trackpad registers a click.


A: Yes, it has two physical buttons on the edge lacking the battery tray. The two rubber feet on the bottom-front of the trackpad press against  internal switches.
For these to activate, you have to use it on a hard surface. The software tap-to-click that senses your finger pad deforming as it taps the immovable glass surface also will trigger a tap independently from the physical buttons. 

A: Yes.  But sort of hidden.  If you reach under the trackpad, the feet on the bottom front act as a single button when pressed.  
If you justs press the entire trackpad down on a hard surface to activate these buttons on the bottom.  But, if you are holding the trackpad in the air, squeezing one of the bottom feet directly will also work.
