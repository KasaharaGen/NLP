Q: iMac gamma problem I have an iMac 24", running OSX 10.5.8. I noticed sometimes when I wake my Mac from screensaver, the gamma is off. The screen becomes very white-washed looking. I can get it back to normal gamma by firing up System Preferences -> Display without changing any settings.
I do this every time and it's become very annoying. Can someone tell me what's going on and how I can fix it permanently? I don't have this problem on my MBP.

A: Give Flux a try. It’s a “free” tiny application that not only will help you not burn your eyes when it’s “dark” outside, but also touches the gamma every time and perhaps when doing that it bypasses Leopard’s bug.
