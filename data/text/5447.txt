Q: Can i install the applications disc of my snow leopard on Mac OS X Lion? I had Snow Leopard running on my MBP, now I just installed Lion on a Clean Installation and I noticed iLife is not in the installer. 
Can I insert my snow leopard's application disc and install them on Lion ?

A: Yes
I have verified that this works first hand.
