Q: Can I change some but not all Apple keyboard function keys (dim vs F1, bright vs F2)? I want to override F1 and F2 behavior, since I have external display and Mac can't control display's brightness. The rest of the keys should retain their non Fx
I know about "Use all F1-F12 keys as standard function keys.", but I don't want to change all of the keys to be F when pressed, just some of them. (For me single press music and volume control is necessary.)
Is there a way to pick some of the function keys to default to numbered function instead of the "Apple" definitions system wide?

A: Another great way to fully customise Function keys (or any keys) is KeyRemap4Macbook
You can customise individual or key type behaviour either per application or system wide.
It's also free.

A: A slightly clunky workaround would be to turn them all into standard function keys, and then program the ones that you want manually through the Keyboard Shortcuts section. That would obviously be no good if you wanted to use the function keys for other behaviour.

A: You can use BetterTouchTool for this. It is a paid app (at least 4,45â‚¬) but it's totally worth the price!

*Select in the keyboard preferences, that by default you want to use F keys.

*Disable "F > 6" shortcuts:


*Set new global keyboard shortcuts in BetterTouchTool:


*Done!


A: You can use FunctionFlip to change individual "special" keys back to their function key value.
