Q: What are the default permissions on the Applications folder in OS X supposed to be? I was trying to run VirtualBox on OS X when I got the error:
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine tinyXP.
Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE).
Unknown error creating VM (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE).


According to this article http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/8410, it is because the permissions on my /Applications folder are too broad. I checked, and I was actually very surprised to learn that the folder was in fact world-readable / world-writable.
drwxrwxrwx+ 164 root  admin      5576 Jun 26 22:27 Applications

So before I go changing them, I'm wondering if that is normal or if somehow they got changed?

A: That is not normal - I have
drwxrwxr-x+ 73 root     admin         2482 24 Jun 09:28 Applications/

There is a option in Disk Utility.app to repair permissions which should change the Applications directory and others back.
