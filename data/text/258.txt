Q: Finding Firefox bookmarks in Spotlight Is there a program that will allow me to use Spotlight to search my Firefox bookmarks and open the browser window?

A: *

*First, download this file to your desktop: ffmd.sh

*Open a terminal, and run the following:

sudo mkdir /usr/local
  sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin
  sudo mv ~/Desktop/ffmd.sh
  /usr/local/bin/
  sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ffmd.sh
  sudo chown root:wheel
  /usr/local/bin/ffmd.sh



*

*Now, schedule the task with crontab. The following line will schedule for 10 minutes: 



0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *
  /usr/local/bin/ffmd.sh > /dev/null
  2>&1

A: Here is a proof of concept ffmd_sqlite script that uses the Firefox places database. Webloc docs are created that will be found by Spotlight and can be opened with Firefox.
