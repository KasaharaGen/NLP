Q: Why is file sharing missing from sharing preferences? File sharing is not an option for me under 'sharing'.

The image above illustrates the lack of file sharing, but I do have the following items:


*

*dvd or cd sharing

*screen sharing

*scanner sharing

*remote login

*remote management

*remote apple events

*bluetooth sharing


Any idea why certain macs have different items in the sharing pane?
