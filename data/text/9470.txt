Q: Can I upgrade from 10.6 to 10.7 for free? When I bought my new Mac at the end of July, 2011, the dealer (Microcenter, Marietta, GA) Renee told me I had 4 months to upgrade to Lion. I calendared the drop dead date at the end of November, and now discover I only had 30 days.  
Is there a way to upgrade for free at this time?

A: Apple's policy is that you get an OS upgrade for free as soon as the launch date of the new OS has been officially announced. For Lion, this was after July 21st. However, as you discovered yourself:

Remember your completed order must be entered within 30 days of the date of your purchase of a qualifying computer.

So no, you won't be able to get anything from Apple's up-to-date program, which is the only way to get an OS upgrade for free.
