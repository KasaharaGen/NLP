Q: How to enable iOS 4.3+ multitasking gestures on iPad? Apparently Apple enabled multitasking gestures on the iPad in a 4.3 beta but later removed them... However those that managed to get them have maintained them through future updates (at least up to 4.3.2).
This site http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/13/want-new-gesture-controls-in-ios-4-3-on-your-ipad-heres-how/ describes a way to re-enable them if you do a collection of steps and buy an app but that seems a bit drastic for basic functionality.
Are there any other free options to re-enable this feature?

A: Both the latest Xcode 3 and the latest Xcode 4 allow you to mark an iPad with the latest 4.3.x as being "used for development". You can cancel if asked for your developer program credentials (which cost $99) and still have access to the gesture switch on the iPad.
Xcode 4 is only available presently as a $5 download from the Mac App store or with the $99 paid Mac Developer program as a restricted download. The free developer account (which still allows you to get Xcode 3) is fairly painless to set up as long as you can agree to all the conditions. You can see the various free and paid programs at http://developer.apple.com/programs/which-program/ - it used to be simpler but the free account is still fairly powerful but not on the cutting edge with pre-release
As with anything that is in software development, all things subject to change often and YMMV.

A: It's not basic functionality, really, it's special developer-only functionality; flipping a software switch is technically simple but it's pretty advanced (and often problematic) functionality in terms of how the OS is affected. As such your iPad has to think you're a developer before it will allow you to change the setting. 
The two ways to convince it you're a developer: 


*

*Join the paid iOS Developer Program for $99/year, download Xcode, and register your device.

*Pay $5 to download Xcode and register your device.
Only Xcode is capable of flipping that switch, outside of (potentially) jailbreaking.

A: Based on my reading of that site, it is free. You can download XCode for free. You do not need to pay $99 to join the developer program.

A: You should be able to enable this functionality on a jailbroken iPad via an app in Cydia. There are several out there that do this same feature for iPod Touches and iPhone 4s as well (in case you have them).
See http://www.chiphazard.com/2011/04/08/enable-multitasking-gestures-on-ios-4-3-1-without-xcode-or-sn0wbreeze-jailbreak/ for nice instructions on how to enable for iOS 4.3.1. It is possible that if you have 4.3.2 that it won't work, but it is worth a try. If you have no luck there, try http://smashingstories.com/2011/04/12/how-to-enable-multitasking-gestures-on-ios-4-3-1-with-cydia-tweak/.
(For the record, I have a Mac and used the XCode method, so I can't say it will work or not for the iPad.)
