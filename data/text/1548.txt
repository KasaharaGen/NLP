Q: What's a good place online to sell a used Mac? Where can I buy or sell a used iMac online?
EDIT:
I have a 21.5" iMac (Core 2 Duo, late 2009) and a MacBook which is about two months old. I'd like to sell both and upgrade.

A: If you're in the USA, gazelle.com can be a good place, but the prices aren't always great.

A: I believe you can trade your machine(s) in when you purchase a new one from Apple.  They will reduce your cost for the new machine, certify your old ones and do any repairs necessary, and put them back on the market for others to purchase.

A: I've heard of these guys several times previously, but don't have any experience of using them myself. http://www.powermax.com/ I suspect you won't get the best deal if trading in an old machine.
