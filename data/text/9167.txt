Q: How does iTunes Match handle metadata? When I purchase songs from iTunes, I often times hate the way the MetaData is presented. For example, I prefer the format
Artist          Song Name 
-------------------------
artist_name     song_name f/ featured_artists

But songs purchased from iTunes usually come in the form
Artist                                    Song Name
---------------------------------------------------
artist_name feat. featured_artists        song_name

My concern is that once I use iTunes match to match all of my music with the music that exists on Apple's servers, iTunes is going to use the MetaData as stored on their servers as opposed to the MetaData that I have meticulously set in my library.
If it is going to use Apple's MetaData instead of my own, this is a complete deal breaker for me.
Does anybody who has signed up for/used iTunes Match know the way iTunes Match behaves in this regard?

A: It keeps your custom metadata!
