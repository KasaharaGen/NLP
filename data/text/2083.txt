Q: iPad Charging USB Hub? 
Possible Duplicate:
When I plug my iPad into my computer USB ports, iPad displays “Not Charging”.  What can I do? 

Newer MacBooks provide enough juice through the built-in USB ports for the iPad to charge quickly, and one can use the wall outlet to get the job done as well. However, there don't seem to be any hubs out there that do anything but trickle-charge... 
Is anyone aware of a USB hub that can charge an iPad? I'd really like to be able to sync & charge at the same time without having to plug in directly into the MacBook.

A: Apple's online store sells two Belkin USB hubs with support for "high-power devices":
