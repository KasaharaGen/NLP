Q: Samba is removed from Lion. How is the role of auto_master changed I used to use the /etc/auto_master file to load SMB shares in Snow leopard Mac OS X
Now that Samba is removed, I wonder what should be the correct way to auto mount windows shares.

A: Mac OS X never used Samba's SMB client. Mac OS X has always used an SMB client implementation based on Boris Popov's smbfs for FreeBSD. I don't think that's changing in Lion, so its relation to /etc/auto_master probably isn't changing.
As for the SMB server side, Samba is surely being replaced with a different SMB server software package.
