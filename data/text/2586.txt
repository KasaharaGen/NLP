Q: New File Action in Finder 
Why finder doesn't have 'New File', but 'New Folder'?
Is there any way/tool for having 'New File' in Finder?
ADDED
Pathfinder provides the feature of making 'New File'. I need this function in Finder. 


A: The idea in OS X is, that you open an Application and create the file while you are working. This simply because creating the file beforehand is kind of awkward:  

Create file > open file > edit

Of course if you just need dummy files, then you can make those from Terminal.app, but I'd be careful with that if you are not used to it already.
The command is: touch filename

A: proseek you can add to finder the extension "shellhere", that's great!
