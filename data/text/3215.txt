Q: LAN map for Mac OS X I'm looking for a program that will create a visual map of my home network, I've found lanmap but it requires too many programs to be installed to be able to run. 
Does anyone knows a native Mac app for the job?

A: iNet for Mac is avail­able for down­load at the App­Store. It is a native osx app that shows you what your mac is connected to.

A: Check out nmap with the zenmap GUI. It's normally a port scanner but it creates visual maps of what you scan.
