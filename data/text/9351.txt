Q: What are good travel game apps for iPad to entertain a 2-3 year old My wife is to face a 2h flight with our very active daughter and would like to prepare some distractions.
Specifically we are looking for very simple, entertaining games a toddler can handle. We already have "Memory" and she really enjoys it.
It should be as colorful as it can get and interactive where swiping and touching a thing is the most sophisticated gesture she can handle. Doesn't really have to have a goal, just do stuff.

A: This is an iPhone app, but will work on iPad, It is a game made for toddlers.

A: There are a lot of apps for children. You can find some decent apps here and here, or just by using the terms "iPad app Children" in Google :-)
Enjoy you flight!
