Q: Screen sharing - can you prevent the attached screen from turning on? I have a machine at work that I sometimes like to connect to using screen sharing, but I don't want anyone else in the office to be able to see what I'm doing.  I also don't want to give them access to the computer - I password-lock my screen with a screen saver when I'm not at the machine, but when I log on with screen sharing, I have to disable this lock.
So, is there any way to prevent the original screens from becoming active while using screen sharing?

A: in Lion this is possible, but don't remember seeing this anywhere in previous versions. When you start a screen sharing session it will ask you how you want to view the remote session.
