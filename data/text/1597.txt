Q: Why does Safari always hang? I use Safari as my browser, but I've found that it frequently hangs for 20, 30 seconds (sometimes longer), often times when I wake it up from sleep and/or when I open a new tab.
Though I'm not sure it would be helpful, the next time it does it I'll see if I can sample the process and report back with the results. In the meantime, is there something I can try? I'm running on a mid-2007 MacBook so, while I think I have enough processing power (2x2.16Ghz) and memory (2GB), I suspect it's a disk issue.
Is there something I can do to reduce disk usage? Should I clear my cache (this isn't a problem), my history (I want to keep this if possible) or both?
edit: Is there any way to determine what plugins I have installed? I have RescueTime and Evernote, so either of them could be the culprit, but I know that there are programs that like to install hidden extensions, so that could be the problem as well.
By the way, here's that sampling output summary - I've cut out the call tree as it was way too long to post:

A: In my book, Adobe Flash is always the first culprit for issues with browser stability and responsiveness. Try installing ClickToFlash and see if that helps things.

A: Did you update to Safari 4.0.3 yet? 
I was having problems with 4.0.2

A: Go to Java Preferences -> Disable java-SE
Then try to open webpage in Safari again.
