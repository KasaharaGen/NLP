Q: Graphic cards issue I am running a Mac Pro as a kind of server for an application, everything is automated and I am usually using Remote desktop.
Now I have the need to update the Mac version and just realized that the graphics card might be broken as I have tried two different screens without success and in the system profiler the graphics card information is just blank.
In which log files can I check that the graphic card is not found during startup. What would be the procedure to replace the graphic card as I could imagine version problems...

A: I can't say where the log files are located, though you can be fairly confident that if nothing shows up in the Graphics/Displays then the graphics card will need to be replaced. You can check the display and graphics info from the Terminal as well with system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
I've replaced a few Mac Pro graphics card and the procedure is straightforward. As long as the card is Mac-compatible it's been plug n' play. There are detailed instructions from Apple. And plenty of videos on Youtube.
