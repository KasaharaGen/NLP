Q: How to transfer a Motion (5) project between Macs? I need to be able to work on a motion project on-the-go on a MacBook Pro, but it really seems to be lagging performance wise, so I want to transfer the project to a iMac while at home, and to transfer it back onto the MacBook when I go out again. So how do I transfer the active project along with all required data easily between two computers?
Edit:
Never mind, apparently when you save you can save as a folder, copying all the media into that folder. I'll just leave this up for others who have the same question. 

A: When you save you can save as a folder ("Copy Media"), and it will copy all the media into a folder in the folder of the project, allowing it to be moved around.

A: If the size of the associated media files make copying prohibitive, booting your laptop in target disk mode (hold down 'T' key while booting) is a great solution that has worked for me many times.

A: You can always sync your files with dropbox.
