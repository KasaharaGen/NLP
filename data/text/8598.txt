Q: How do I give mysqld write access to a directory? I am running OSX right now and trying to run a mysqld process and seeing the following error:
 $ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld --user=root
111026 11:05:08 [Warning] Can't create test file /usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data/XXX.lower-test

I understand the problem is since I am not using sudo, my current user account does not have write access to
/usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data/
I am trying accomplish two different things


*

*Give the mysqld process write access to that directory without using chmod 700 or whatever. I am trying to use chown and it is not working

*Create a script so the mysqld process starts at boot-up
Can anyone help me?

A: Depending on the uid mysqld is using, chmod 700 on the data directory might not help. You may do the following:


*

*chmod 777 /usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data/

*Startup mysqld again

*ls -l /usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data/ to identify the owner of the created files

*chown OWNER /usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data

*chmod 700 /usr/local/mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86_64/data/
