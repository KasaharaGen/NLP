Q: iMac forgets brightness When I set my brightness on a 27'' iMac (2011) next time it boots up, it's dimmed. I switched off the ambient sensor, so this shouldn't be the problem. The connected Cinema Display remembers the brightness correctly.
Had anyone the same problem and found a solution?

A: I have heard a few people complain of brightness resetting on reboot. Traditionally brightness settings are stored in the PRAM, which you can reset via ⌘⌥PR on booting. I would be interested to see if it gets "stuck" on a brightness setting that you do not wish to have after resetting the PRAM.
