Q: Moving email from Gmail to Mail.app locally I have a large amount of email in Gmail, the account is at 99% capacity. I'd like to remove this from Gmail and only store it locally. Using mail.app When I drag the message from a Gmail mailbox into a local folder the message still appears on Gmail.
How can I move the messages locally so they don't appear in Gmail anymore?
Thanks,

A: I'm guessing you might need to manually delete the messages in Gmail as well. I'm not familiar with copying mail to a local folder, but I do know that Gmail is VERY protective of keeping its mail within its service as much as possible.
That would be the best advice I can offer.
