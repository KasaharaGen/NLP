Q: How does Office 2008 for Mac store its Recent items? I don't have access to Office 2008, but require the information for a project I'm working on. I'm mainly interested in Word, Excel and Powerpoint.
This is the information I have gathered so far...
The preference file is: ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist
The property keys take the form:
2008\File Aliases\{APP}{n}
2008\MRU Access Date\{APP}{n}
where {APP} represents an Office application, and {n} represents a number starting from 0.
The applications are represented by the following values:
MSWD (Word)
XCEL (Excel)
What value represents PowerPoint?
In the property list I've seen, the numbers represented by {n} range from 0-10 (11 items).
Is 10 the limit? or is this unrestrained?
Finally, I've noticed that Office 2011 does not add its Recent Items to the Apple System menu:
Apple -> Recent Items
Is Office 2008 the same?

A: At least on my machine, this is what I'm seeing:


*

*PPT3 does appear to be the PowerPoint value

*I have lots of items. MSWD0, MSWD1, but then also MSWD99, MSWD109, etc. 

*Interestingly enough, it looks like PowerPoint adds items to Apple -> Recent Items, but Word and Excel do not. Which seems crazy, but that's what's happening on my machine.
