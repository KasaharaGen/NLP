Q: How can I run iPhone app in Simulator without opening Xcode using command-line utility I know that there are some utilities which allows us to install iPhone apps to Simulator. But I found problems installing in this way when I have two Xcode versions installed on the system.
I want to set the environment variable for that utility. How can I set the private framework path for that utility?
