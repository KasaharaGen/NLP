Q: Copy tunes to 2nd PC without syncing I just purchased an album on iTunes on work PC but can't sync because it will delete all my existing tunes from the iPad (I only sync with my music at home).
Can I copy the files to my home PC manually and sync there, or will that not work because of DRM issues ?

A: If you have the same iTunes account you bought the music from on the other machine, you'll be OK. Just go to that machine and choose Store -> Authorize this computer.... You can have up to 5 computers authorized to play your DRM'd music. Also, if you want to transfer music off an iPod, there are ways to do that without erasing it. Here's a link with info on apps for that.
