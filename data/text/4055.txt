Q: iPhone ring notification on the computer Is there a way with Bluetooth or WiFi or something that will display on my mac mini's screen that there is an incoming phone call or SMS and who its from with possibly a photo?
Edit
I'm currently on a non-jailbroken phone, so would be most interested in solutions that would work a non-jailbroken phone. On the other hand... if the only solution (seamless preferably - ie the phone talks to the computer, not through a 3rd party server out in the internet someplace) is with a jailbroken phone, this would be a reason for me to do it...

A: As far as I know, there's no way to do that directly with a non-jailbroken iPhone.  (I would love to be wrong about that, though.)
You might be able to set up your phone with a third-party service to get functionality like this.  For example, using Google Voice with an app like GrowlVoice ($5).  GrowlVoice can provide real-time SMS notifications, but I'm not sure about real-time call notifications.
