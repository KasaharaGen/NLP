Q: Browsers won't load css/js files with https URL Firefox, Safari and Chrome won't load any CSS or JS files when I open an HTTPS url, for example on Twitter, it will only load the HTML.
When I look at firebug in Firefox I get the following errors:



*

*Mac OS X version: 10.6.7

*And all my browsers are up to date.


Anyone any idea what it could be?

A: Just a thought ... have you checked if you are using any custom Styles in those browsers? Alternatively for Safari make sure to check in the Develop menu if you have disabled styles or JS. Just to eliminate the possible culprits.

A: My system date wasn't correct, it was set 2 months back. When I changed it to the date of today my problem was solved.

A: I had the same issue in all the browsers. Clearing the cache solved this for me.
