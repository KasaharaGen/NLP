Q: How do I mount a jailbroken iPhone as a volume in Lion? In Snow Leopard I was using this utility (it uses MacFuse) to mount my iPhone as a volume upon its connection. Worked very well, and I could browse my jailbroken iPhone's files easily and drag/drop over themes like on a normal HD.
Since OS X Lion, it doesn't appear to be working. Are there any un-obtrusive tweaks to achieve this again? Or does anyone know how to get the MacFuse filesystem working on OS X Lion?
