Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for launching Activity Monitor? I can't seem to find a shortcut for launching the activity monitor. Does it have one?

A: Save in AppleScript Editor and assign a shortcut in FastScripts or some other way:
tell app "Activity Monitor"
    reopen -- makes a new window if there are no existing windows
    activate -- brings the app to front
end tell


A: Create in Automator an Action to launch Activity Monitor:

Then in System Preferences -> Shortcuts Tab -> Services set a keyboard shortcut for the created service:


A: Otherwise of Spotloight that @Calavera suggest you can use 3rd-party software such as:


*

*QuickSilver

*Namely

*TigerLaunch

*HimmelBar

*LaunchBar
I myself use QuickSilver and set shortcut ⌘+space to run it and type some part of "Activity Monitor" and press ⌫ so Activity Monitor will run.


A: For starting apps, scripts, etc. with a single shortcut, there exist some specific tools.


*

*NuKit - free trial, download from MacUpdate or their site.

*Apptivate - 2.0 is no longer free and as of now, it's unfortunately traded usability for eye candy.


Apptivate offers to switch away from apps with the same shortcut. The NuKit team promised to add it soon.

A: You can use System keyboard shortcuts, Services and Automator to do this.

A: A simpler way is using aliases. Most pro users use them pretty frequently and I have one for launching Activity Monitor as well.

Even on macOS Big Sur my default shell is bash and not zsh. Put the following line in ~/.bash_profile file: (I switched to zsh finally. All of my bash aliases worked fine except for the ones containing special characters. I just added a \ in front of the special characters to escape them and then it all worked as expected.)
Put the following line in ~/.zshrc:
alias am="open -a activity\ monitor"

Now, all you have to do is type am in Terminal, press enter, and it opens Activity Monitor.

FWIW, here's other aliases too that I have in my ~/.zshrc that have incredibly improved my ability to use macOS:

Side Note: To learn how to migrate your aliases from bash to zsh, see this.

A: Not by default, but you can create one in System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Keyboard Shortcuts.  Or you can use spotlight:


*

*type ⌘ + space

*start typing "activity monitor"

*as soon as activity monitor is highlighted in the spotlight list, hit return

A: You can you use BetterTouchTool to create keyboard shortcuts and even use the trackpad to create a gesture instead of keyboard shortcuts.

A: Hammerspoon is my favorite and is probably the most easiest to install and configure. 
Here is the init.lua code for launching the Activity Monitor. 
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd","shift"}, "Escape", function()
   hs.application.open("Activity Monitor")
end)

PS: I mapped my command key to control. So by mapping the hotkey to "cmd+shift+escape", I get similar functionality that I get in Windows(for opening the task manager)
