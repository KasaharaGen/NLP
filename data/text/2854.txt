Q: iPod touch 4G internal microphone? Based on the specs page, Apple seems to indicate that the 4th gen iPod touch has an internal microphone. Is this true, or are they merely indicating its compatibility with the headphones-with-remote-and-mic?

A: It has a microphone. It is the little hole beside the back camera (no idea why they put it there).
