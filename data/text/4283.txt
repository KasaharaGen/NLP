Q: Has 10.6.7 broken the built-in Cisco IPSec VPN client? No longer able to connect to my Cisco VPN using 10.6.7. No configuration changes have happened and another machine still on 10.6.6 works correctly.
If you've experienced this and resolved the issue, please advise.

A: Not sure if it's the same issue, but I've had problems with the 10.7 built-in Cisco IPSec client from within my work network - there are some cryptic references (i.e. tech-speak I don't understand) to what Apple changed at the bottom of this support discussion.
Switching over to a tethered 3G connection fixed the problem. I mention it here in case someone stumbles across this page & it helps them.

A: Apparently the Cisco client doesn't work in 64bit mode, so you need to reboot and hold down the 3 and 2 keys whilst booting to boot into 32bit mode.   That should make it work.
Info here.
