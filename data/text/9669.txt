Q: Parallels - Can I have a keyboard shortcut for the context-menu key found on Wintel hardware? On a lot of Windows keyboards there's a key to the right of the spacebar that brings up the context-menu (right-click menu) in applications (I'm running Win7). I can't seem to find a way to map this function to the VM's keyboard in Parallels. Is it even possible?

A: For Bootcamp I'm using AutoHotkey app as a way to remap standard Windows keyboard switch combination to Command ⌘+Space.
I've just tried to remap right command key of my Apple Aluminum keyboard to become Context menu key and it works with editing AutoHotkey.aht configuration file  and adding 

RWin::AppsKey

as a key binding. You may read more on remapping with AutoHotKey here. And here is a list of key names. 
Also, in Windows, Shift ⇧+F10 should act as a context menu shortcut but I can't attest since my F10 key is not working and I'm too lazy to boot into Windows again and remap it just to test it.)
