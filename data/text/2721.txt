Q: Count the number of open windows Is there a tool to count the number of windows I have open, including on all Spaces?
I am curious and too lazy to do it manually. :)

A: I guess this AppleScript should do:
set numberOfWindows to "0"

tell application "System Events"
    set allProcesses to application processes
    repeat with i from 1 to number of allProcesses
        tell process i
            set numberOfWindows to (numberOfWindows + (count windows))
        end tell
    end repeat
end tell
