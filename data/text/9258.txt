Q: How to print as PDF using Acrobat 10, when no printer is installed? Preview or Acrobat can both print out individual pages of a PDF file, as a new PDF file containing only those pages, but I think Acrobat 10 probably can print out page 1, 10-12, and 5 -- in any order, while Preview can only print out the "selected page" and must be in ascending page number order.
Preview can do that, but if using Acrobat 10, then going to File -> Print will actually trigger a "No printer is installed.  Please install a printer first"...  The thing is, I am really trying to print as a PDF file and there is no printer around... so is there a way to get past that dialog and print the pages as a PDF file?

A: When you have a file that you want to print as a PDF, go to "Print.." (Command âŒ˜ + P) and select "PDF" in the left hand corner:

Then select "Save as PDF...":

Then, you'll be presented with a save dialog:

Using this method, you shouldn't need to have a printer installed.
