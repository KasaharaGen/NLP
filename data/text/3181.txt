Q: HD webcam for iChat I've seen a couple of Mac compatible HD webcams for sale, but they often come with the caveat of falling back to VGA resolutions when used with any application not supported by the camera manufacturer. So, my question is:
Which webcams can I purchase which will support HD resolutions in all Mac video applications?

A: I had a look at "Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910", (STAY AWAY) 
(but I read that various mac users had issues with it, so I investigated.)
I found this on TUAW,(2011-01-04) Logitech's HD Pro Webcam C910 now ready for Photo Booth, iChat and FaceTime :

The software allows integration with
  iPhoto and iMovie, and enables the
  C910 webcam to be used with Skype,
  Yahoo! Messenger and Gmail Voice and
  Video Chat.

I really can't help you ... I would hold out for the Logitech ... maybe a updated Driver will fix the issues.

A: Saw this on Mashable and thought about the question :
