Q: Configure Launchpad OSX Lion How to configure launchpad on OSX Lion?
Like 


*

*Hide some application

*Group application into folder

*Sort application alphabetical


A: Lion’s LaunchPad acts much like iOS’ Springboard (the iDevice home screen launcher), which means that


*

*you can create folders by dragging one Launchpad app icon onto another – add more items by dragging them onto the newly created folder. Folders can be renamed by clicking their title when opened. They cannot be nested.

*you can only sort items by dragging them around.

*hiding apps is not a feature (there is a closing cross on App Store installed apps when you press Option, but this uninstalls the app – it does not hide it from Launchpad). Use Launchpad-Control (freeware) to achieve that.
