Q: Dock in Lion FullScreen I would like to know if there is a way to have the dock always there when running an App fullscreen in lion?

A: It is very unlikely that Apple will ever support this request officially, as it would go against their whole "full-screen" philosophy. However, it ought to be possible to create a SIMBL hack which achieves it.
If you do want the dock visible when using an app - perhaps the best solution is not to use fullscreen, but simply make the app window large by using the green traffic light button or dragging the edges.
