Q: Tool or trick to require doubleclicking to launch apps from dock? Is there a way to make it so that launching an app from the dock requires a double click instead of a single click?  I find myself accidentally launching apps and then needing to force-quit them.  
I'm hoping for some OS hack or third-party app.  Yes, I already have the dock hidden.
thanks!

A: You can move the dock's location and size by going to System Preferences > Dock. Rather than keeping the dock at the bottom, where the mouse needs to be often, move it to either the right or left sides of the screen. 
I auto-hide the dock on the left side of the screen (I'm on a 13" MacBook Air, so my vertical space is limited too). You could also use @VxJasonxV's suggestion of removing the apps from the dock. Most of the programs I launch are via  spotlight (the ⌘+Space shortcut is very useful). And the last trick I use is BetterTouchTool. I bound five-finger-click to ⌘+Q, which makes it very easy to quit applications, but not so easy that it accidentally quits applications I didn't mean to quit.

A: *

*Don't hide the Dock. You'll be less surprised when it pops out at you and eats your click.

*If applications must be "force quit" when you accidentally open them, get them out of your Dock! Use a launcher like Alfred, LaunchBar, Quicksilver, or Google Quick Search Box. Or even Spotlight!
I rarely, if ever, use the mouse to open applications, much less use the dock.
