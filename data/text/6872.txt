Q: An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing I'm using MobileMe to sync my keychain between an iMac and a MacBook Air. Since both machines run Lion this error message pops up every other system start (or when waking up from sleep):
"An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing." 
I have already reset the keychain on MobileMe and on both machines but the error message keeps coming.
Is there anything else I can do?

A: No solution yet, looks like an OSX Lion issue...
