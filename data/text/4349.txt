Q: Why is my Macbook Pro 2011 video garbled after sleep? Occasionally when I open my new (April 2011) Macbook Pro I'm greeted by an unusable system with a garbled display.  Most often I have to force a reboot (hold down power button for 10+ seconds), but occasionally it will fix itself if I close the lid and re-open it.

*What is the problem, or what should I look at to find the problem?

*Are there other things I could try to wake this laptop from this state?

*I can't reliably reproduce the problem, so it doesn't seem that taking it to the genius bar is going to yield useful results, but tell me if I'm making a bad assumption here and I should take it back.



System info:


*

*MacBookPro8,3

*ATI Radeon HD 6750M

*Intel HD Graphics 3000

*If anything else is relevant, let me know and I'll post it.  It's a standard 17" MBP, though I've added memory (notably this problem did occur prior to adding memory as well)


A: It was bad memory.  I had upgraded to 8GB, but at some point suspected the memory for some other problem, so put the original Apple 4GB back in.  Both problems went away (tested for 3 months) so I ditched the 8GB and got 16GB of higher quality memory that more closely matched the timing specifications of the original Apple memory.
So far, after two months, I haven't seen this or the other issue yet.  So in this case it was bad (or wrong) memory.

A: Definitely take it to an Apple Store if you have one close by. Even if you can't reproduce it right then and there, show them the photo above. It might be a hardware problem (loose connection, faulty graphics chip, etc.), so you'll want to get it looked at by a professional.

A: I know that's an old post but i would like to share this [1] video I've just uploaded about an old Macbook Pro Late 2011 which is suffering same or similar glitch. While disassembling the screen I noticed touching a sensor on the display electronic board "fixed" the issue.  
In the video, what' i'm touching is the cable which connects the screen to the display logic board. So the issue seems to be in the wire or the socket which interconnects the screen to the display logic board located on the bottom of the screen.
Just in case it helps someone to identify the issue.
