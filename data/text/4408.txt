Q: Recover docx files We have just discovered that none of the passwords on our word documents work any longer, and I need a recommendation of an application that I can use to recover the files.
I believe the files had been created on a windows based computer, so I do not have much of a problem with using a windows based program if required.

A: This applies to .docx files:


*

*Create a back-up copy of the file

*Change the extension from .docx to .zip

*Open new .zip file

*Extract all files

*In the extracted folder, navigate to word\settings.xml

*Open settings.xml

*Remove the tag w:documentProtection, don't forget to include the < and />

*Save file

*Copy to modified settings.xml to the actual .zip file (over write)

*Rename .zip to .docx

*Open file


Microsoft Office 2007 and up are xml files that can be edited if you know what to look for.
I just want to add that I am NOT responsible for what you do with this information.  I do believe that knowledge is power and with power comes responsibility.
