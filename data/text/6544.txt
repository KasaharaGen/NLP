Q: Disable volume control noise on mac book pro? When I hit F11 or F12 (volume up and volume down) I get the volume control overlay; the volume increases or decreases; and the machine makes an "SQUICK SQUICK SQUICK" noise.
How do I keep the functionality of the keys but stop them making that noise?
(Mac Book Pro with Snow Leopard)

A: You can change this in System Preferences.
Go to the Sound pane, and uncheck the Play feedback when volume is changed checkbox.

Also, if you want to not play the sound for a given change (a one-off thing), hold down shift and change the volume.
This will also play the sound if it's turned off.
