Q: Can't install Homebrew on Mac OS X Lion I followed the simple instructions on Homebrew's homepage:
Paste this at a terminal prompt:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"

But I get the following permission errors.  What is the proper way to install Homebrew on Mac OS X Lion?
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/Library/Formula/...
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/...

Press enter to continue

A: Try this: sudo /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)".

A: I just struggled with the same problem, but instead of manually entering any commands†, I used gist: 768518 to do the dirty stuff for me. Worked like a charm—and you won't need any sudoing!
The aforementioned gist (aptly described as "Fix permissions on /usr/local for Homebrew") only fixes the permissions, i.e. it doesn't install Homebrew despite the fact it is a fork of the installation script.

†) other than the required $ chmod a+x fix_homebrew.rb and $ ./fix_homebrew.rb of course

A: the official oneliner from brew.sh is this...
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
why would you like to use a outdated gist version and not the original script???

A: Github has a beautiful app for Mac that eliminates the painful commandline process (if the commandline is not your thing that is ;-))

A: try these, these works for me..
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"
