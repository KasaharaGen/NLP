Q: I can't change my skype status to online After installing Lion, I have had trouble setting my status to Online.  It will stay on Away.  I can changed it to the other values, but it will not stay in "Online".  
I contacted Skype about it and their answer was to uninstall, delete the ~/Developer/Application Support/Skype directory, and reinstall.  I believe that worked once, but it is now doing it again.
Has anyone else had this problem and come up with a solution?
As of Sep 28, 2011, I am using Skype 5.3.0.1093.

A: It has to do with the general settings of Skype.
In Skype preferences, on the General tab, make sure the "Set my status to Away after 10 minutes of inactivity" is not checked. 
This worked for me.
