Q: iPod Touch 4th Gen dock with AC or USB power and audio out? I have scoured the internet looking for a dock that will allow me to charge an iPod Touch 4th Gen which includes a jack to connect it to an external stereo system.
I understand this can be accomplished with a standard USB charging cable (plugged into a USB-AC converter) and a male-to-male audio cable, but I'd like a classier way of docking the iPod.

A: The Apple Universal Dock provides both a 30 pin connector for charging and/or syncing as well as a 3.5mm audio output jack.
