Q: The browser doesn't show videos on Youtube Today I noticed that Safari doesn't show anymore the videos shown on Youtube; I just see a black rectangle, and when I try to use the popup menu in that area, it doesn't appear.
As far as I can remember, one week ago I was able to see videos on Youtube. Something is changed in this week; for what I can remember, Safari has not been updated, in these days.
How can I find the reason of the problem, and eventually resolve it?

A: I have the same problem and the only solution I have in the moment is to change the User Agent using the Developer Menu. Safari 4.1.3 - Mac works for me. But this is not permanent! You have to change it every time yu start Safari :-(

A: Are you using flash or html5 youtube?
I recommend to try the html5 version, if you are not using it already.

A: Could it be that Adobe Flash has crashed? Are you running the latest version? 
Also in this time have you restarted Safari/your Mac? If not that may get Flash working again.
