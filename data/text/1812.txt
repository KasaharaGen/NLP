Q: I want to play one podcast only on iPod Touch, but they play in series one after the other I download multiple podcasts from one source, eg, five episodes of Naked Scientists.  I want to listen to one only, but when the first finishes it automatically goes to the second, and third etc.
I want to listen to just one episode at a time and have the iPod Touch turn off when it is finished (this is a sleep-aid for my insomnia...I don't want it playing all night !)
A "Genius" suggested making playlists, but although you can make a podcast playlist, it does NOT sync.

A: With iOS 4, you can make a playlist directly on your device. Go to the Music app, then Playlists, then "Add Playlist...". Type in the name for the playlist, hit Save, and you're presented with a screen to add items to the playlist. Select "Podcasts" (by default, it's found under "More") and select the item you want to play. Tap "Done".
You're all set - just select the item from the playlist and only that item will play.

A: Use the On-The-Go playlist and add the one podcast episode to it. Works from at least iOS 3 or possibly before.
You don't event need to clear the existing playlist, because adding a track will add to the end, so just start from that track and it will stop at the end (unless you have repeat on).

A: You should be able to do this with a smart playlist. Set it up with the following rule:
- Name is {the podcast's name}
- Plays is 0  
Limit it to 1 item, selected by least recently added.
Check the "live updating" box. 
This should give you a playlist with one track - the oldest unheard episode of the podcast. 
I've used a variation on this and it is able to sync to my iPhone (once I selected it to be included in the sync).
