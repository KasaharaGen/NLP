Q: Is there a way to copy mp3 files directly over to an ipod from the command line? Can you copy mp3 files directly to an attached ipod from the command line and have them show up on the ipod for listening?

A: Not unless you use custom firmware (Rockbox, iPod Linux for older models). The iPod depends on a database file for playing files and if you just copy the files over they will not be in said database and subsequently the iPod will not be able to play them.
