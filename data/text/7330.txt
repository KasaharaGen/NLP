Q: iPad 2 darkening of screen down left hand edge I've just bought an iPad 2 and it seems to have a very subtle screen fault: a very slight darkening down the left hand edge of the screen, so that if e.g. a document is being viewed on a white background, the left hand edge (say 1/2 cm) actually appears to be a very light grey. It does seem to be a physical screen issue, in that it appears across different applications, and with the device turned upside down, the fault is now on the right hand side. It's quite subtle, but quite irritating.
For what it's worth, I'm upgrading from an iPad 1 and never had this problem with the previous iPad.
Has anyone heard of/experienced this issue? I assume it's an actual hardware fault and I'll have to take the device back to the shop, and not simply some secret calibration issue...?
