Q: How can I automatically download multiple sites through Coda? I have several sites in Coda that I would like to automatically re-download when I tell it to. The sites are collaboratively managed, and I'd like to download a fresh copy of the sites automatically. I am open to AppleScripting, an Automator workflow, a shell script, a combination of all three, or anything else you suggest. How would I go about doing this?
Edit: Can I write a shell script to download the whole site via FTP, then copy it to my "Sites" folder and overwrite the existing data? I need to be able to do it for more than one site, so I need a way to pass in the domain name, user, password, and the directory I want it to copy to.

A: You could easily use wget for this and script it any which way you like. Here's a quick example of how you could use it to download and overwrite one of your sites in one line:
wget ~/Sites/domain/ ftp://[username]:[password]@ftp.example.com/www/

So to do multiple websites you would use:
wget -P ~/Sites/ -i sites.txt

And your text file might look something like this:
ftp://username:password@ftp.site1.com/www/
ftp://username:password@ftp.site2.com/www/
ftp://username:password@ftp.site3.com/www/

From the wget man page:

  -k,  --convert-links      make links in downloaded HTML or CSS point to
                            local files.
  -K,  --backup-converted   before converting file X, back up as X.orig.
  -m,  --mirror             shortcut for -N -r -l inf --no-remove-listing.
