Q: Can I delete any of the default apps the come with OS X? Is it possible to delete any of the default apps in OS X? I suppose it is possible, but will anything break if I do?
There's some, such as Stickies, iChat, Dictionary, etc. that I either have no use for, or have replaced with my own apps that provide similar functions.
Thanks guys!

A: Sure, you can just delete them. When system updates are applied, though, they may "reappear" and not function as the updater may just blithely write the files, assuming the apps have not been moved or deleted. 
Why delete them? They don't take up much space and you can remove them from the Dock. I don't use Dictionary or Chess either, but it's not an issue sitting there unused.
On second thought, you may not want to remove Dictionary, as there are some system-level things that get definitions, and the definitions might only be in the app bundle.

A: Instead of Uninstalling these apps, you could just hide them.
Doing this in Terminal:
sudo chflags hidden /Applications/Chess.app
Will hide the application from sight, but will still be there.

A: It's also pretty annoying to try to reinstall them if you ever do need them. Most aren't available on Apple's website or any (public) torrent trackers. You have to do something like use Pacifist to dig around .pkgs on the installation disk / image.
I've split my Applications folder into subdirectories, using a ridiculous Windows drive name-like naming scheme. The unused or rarely used bundled apps in "/Applications/B". (A = main, S = secondary, U = utilities, D = developer, N = new, O = old, T = tested, L = library.)

Solve your neat issues by making an
  /Apps or ~/Applications or something
  else, and but Aliases or links from
  there to the few you do use. Then just
  ignore /Applications.

Some dialogs for choosing applications only include things in /Applications and ~/Applications. (+ some in CoreServices.) Many apps will also nag that they can move themselves to the Applications folder on the first launch. Installers will still put things to /Applications. And aliases aren't that neat anyway...
