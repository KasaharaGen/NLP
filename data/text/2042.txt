Q: Alternatives to MetaX? I'm trying to rip some DVDs on my Mac, the boxset for a TV show, using Handbrake. I'd also like to automatically fetch metadata - show name, episode name, etc. But MetaX isn't getting any metadata for me for this particular TV program. Any other Mac apps I can use that do similar?

A: Some that I've found:


*

*iFlicks.app

*Vidalin

*iDentify
I've yet to find one that does everything I want.  iFlicks.app comes close, but the feature I want that's missing is the ability to tag chapters.  You can always use more than one app, but I don't like the idea of different programs overwriting my metadata.

A: You can try Handbrake. Hands down, the best I've tried.
