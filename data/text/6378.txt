Q: How can I do shift + slash on a French AZERTY keyboard? I have a MacBook with a French AZERTY keyboard.
On this keyboard, the forward slash ('/') is over the ':' character, so I have to do: Shift + : to get the /.
However in Eclipse there is a useful shortcut to comment out blocks of code: you do ⌘ + / to put "//" at the beginning of every line of selected code; and Shift + ⌘ + / to put /* and */ at the beginning and the end of selected lines, thus commenting out the block of code.
But as I already need to press Shift to get the /, when I do Shift + ⌘ + :, it understands ⌘ + /, and I get the first shortcut.
I can't seem to get the second shortcut. I even tried Shift + Shift + ⌘ + :, using both Shift keys on my keyboard, and of course it didn't work.
I worked around that by changing Eclipse shortcuts, but I was curious to know if there is a way to achieve that (reaching Shift + /).
I hope you clearly understand this is a matter of the highest importance...

A: As described in several posts, the Ukelele program works to redefine the keyboard if you don't like the default layout.
You can at least find the right key using the Keyboard Viewer - steps on that are here: Where's the # key in Lion
