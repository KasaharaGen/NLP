Q: Which songs in my iTunes library are DRM protected? Is there an easy way to obtain a list of all songs in my iTunes library that are protected by DRM?

A: If you want to see this information without excluding the other songs, you can modify the view options 

and add the "Kind" information column. 

In this column you will see the information you need.

A: Create a smart playlist and use "kind contains protected" as the first rule.
