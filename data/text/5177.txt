Q: How will the OSX Lion upgrade affect my Win 7 bootcamp setup? And what are things to watch out for based on previous upgrades?

A: No, the Lion upgrade will only affect the partitioned part of your hard drive housing Mac OS. 
Edit:
It will also install a small partition housing, basically, the installer of Mac OS. This is so that if your installation ever fails or something like that you can always reinstall.
