Q: What's the purpose of the eject button on the MacBook Air? I was interested to see that the power button on the new Airs has been moved to the keyboard, and was anticipating that it would just replace the eject key that has traditionally taken up that position.
However, this appears not to be the case (pic is from iFixit's teardown guide):

What's the purpose of the eject key with no optical drive?

A: Well, The keyboard is the same as other Macbooks (which have SuperDrive), but in any case, if you have an external (USB) superdrive, the button will work as advertised. 

A: You can use Ejectulate to map the eject key to show you a list of every ejectable volume, making it useful even on a MacBook Air lacking an optical drive.

A: There's also quite a few keyboard shortcuts that use the eject key.

*Control ⌃+Eject ⏏ brings up a screen that has Restart/Sleep/Cancel/Shut Down options

*Command ⌘+Control ⌃+Eject ⏏ instantly restarts

*(etc.)

A: That's funny. I was wondering the same thing when I first opened up my MBA! I asked a Genius at the Apple Store who proceeded to tell me that he had wondered the same thing too, and asked his superior who told him that is was designed for use with the MacBook Air Superdrive, which costs an astounding $79 and is basically a slick looking external DVD writer. Because it's made by Apple it doesn't have any buttons on it, including an eject button. Most new/casual Mac users won't know the drag to eject or context-menu eject methods, so in order to make the drive streamlined with the Mac, they put the eject key on the MacBook Air itself.
I guess Apple anticipates a wide user base for the new Superdrive...
