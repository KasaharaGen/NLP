Q: Is there a way to have Snow Leopard match the scrolling behavior of Lion? I can see that I will quickly come to love the Lion way of scrolling.
My brain will soon become rewired to think of moving the content with my gestures instead of moving the controller down to slide content up in my fixed viewport.
I have several macs that need to remain on Snow Leopard for some time, and would love any suggestions on how I might change them to better fit Lion's new model for scrolling.

A: This post by John Gruber outlines several possibilities:
For OSX:


*

*Scrollvetica

*Scroll Reverser
For Windows:


*

*An AutoHotkey hack
On the Mac side, Scroll Reverser looks nice in the menu bar, is free, and works from Tiger to Snow Leopard (10.4 - 10.6).
