Q: "openssl sha1" broken on Mac OS X Lion, or is there a maximum file size? I am attempting to install a VMware Fusion virtual machine with Windows 2008 R2 server, but I'm having problems with the ISO file I downloaded.
I want to verify that the file is correct before attempting the installation, and the download page at Microsoft MSDN downloads mentions that the file has a SHA-1 checksum of X.
So, I googled on how to verify the SHA-1 digest for a file, and found this page:

Mac OS X: How to verify a SHA-1 digest
  ...
  openssl sha1 [full path to file]

Now, here's the fun part. If I execute the command multiple times, I get different digest values.
Is there any way I can, say, make a copy of the file (I know how to do this part), verify that the two copies are indeed the same (to detect that the file is changing, somehow, but I don't know how to compare files)?
Or is there something fundamentally broken either with the "openssl sha1" command, or with my expectations of it?
Here's a sample run:

SHA1(en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso)= 6b8e9addd77fdaf7f26ca56729802112445d48ec

A: This was a faulty memory chip.
I downloaded a program to test the memory, experimented with which chips it might be, and ended up removing one, which made the memtest program stop complaining.
When I execute the "openssl sha1" command now, multiple times, it produces the same digest every time. Sadly, it's the wrong digest (as compared to the one posted on the web site), so I guess I have to redownload the file.
