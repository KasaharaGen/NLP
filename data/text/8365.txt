Q: Why do flags revert to red in Lion Mail? In Lion Mail, in (IMAP) accounts other than iCloud/MobileMe, flags that I set to colors other than red revert to red over time.
Why is this happening and how do I fix it? What is the soruce of the problem? Is it a bug in Mail, or is it a problem at the server?

A: If you're using Gmail: Starred mails are represented as red flags in Apple Mail.
