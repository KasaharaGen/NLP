Q: Mission Control; how do I correct the order of Desktops? I have 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7? I've been playing with Lion and Mission Control.  I'm not sure how I did it, but I seem to have reordered my desktops.
When I open Mission Control, the labels of the desktops at the top of the screen are (from left to right):
Dashboard, Desktop 1, Desktop 2, Desktop 4, Desktop 5, Desktop 3 (in the wrong place!), Desktop 6, Desktop 7, Desktop 8, Desktop 9
How did I relocate 3?  And how do I put it back in the right place?

A: Starting with Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, you can drag to re-order your desktops, even the ones that are in full-screen mode.

A: You can't drag or relocate them even after you disable automatic ortanization in System Preferences -> Mission Control.
They seem to be fixed, which is weird. Let's hope that in a future update, Apple fixes this issue. 

A: What you can do is this: 
Delete the desktops and then recreate the by hovering over them and pressing the red thing in the corner, then looking at the right to make a new desktop.

This is no longer necessary as of Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, see this answer for an easier solution.

A: By default, Spaces are reorganized by last used. You can change this in System Preferences -> Mission Control.

A: You can change the windows displayed on the single desktops by pressing the alt key and then clicking on a desktop. So if for example you want preview (which was on desktop 3) to move to desktop 2 you would do:

Alt + Click on Desktop 3 & Drag the Window of Preview and put in on
  desktop 2.

Else you can also go to desktop 2 and right click on the Preview icon in the Dock and then click on: Assign to Desktop 2.
