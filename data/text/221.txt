Q: Do all Safari 5 Extensions work on windows / mac? I wold like to download some safari extensions, but I'm not sure if I should be looking for ones specifically written to run in Windows. Should I be looking for platform specific extensions?

A: Yes, all Safari extensions run equally on Windows and Mac OS, so you do not need to look for platform-specific versions. All Safari extensions (that use the official extension API) are required to be written in pure Javascript, so they will work on all platforms.
