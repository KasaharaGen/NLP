Q: In Lion can I get the four fingere swipe to do COMMAND+Tab? I recently switched to Lion from Snow Leopard (Yah I know, I am late), it is great, the only one thing that I miss is the four fingere swipe that did COMMAND+TAB 
Is there anyway I can enable that?

A: BetterTouchTool
can surely do this and a lot more! Enjoy:
