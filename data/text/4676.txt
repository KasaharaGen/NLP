Q: Are their drivers for the Apple Keyboard in Windows 7 64bit?(Bonus point: Where's Print Screen?) I am using the official wired Apple Keyboard with my Windows 7 64bit Desktop, is there a source for official drivers anywhere?
I'm kinda fine with the default setup, but I'd really like the ability to printscreen! I am in the UK, but wouldn't mind switching language if that makes all the keys work in he right place.

A: I use a Apple Keyboard on W7 Daily.
The key thing is to use a utility that lets you remap the keys.
Personally, I use a little utility called KeyTweak (It's Free!), but there are lots of other alternatives.
This lets you set unused keys to whatever you want - I have F13 set as print-screen, and F14-F19 set as media playback keys (play, pause, etc).
It can also let you fix the windows/alt keys so they are in the correct place, if that bothers you.
There are a couple of caveats, namely I have yet to find anything that lets you make use of the "fn" and eject keys. However, the additional (unused) F13-F19 keys compensate for that.

A: You can find the drivers in the Mac OS X Install DVD (if you have it) at \Boot Camp\Drivers\Apple\x64\AppleKeyboardInstaller64.exe.
If you do not have the DVD, you will have to remap the keys, as mentioned in Fake Name's answer.
To take a print screen (with the drivers installed), press F13 or Fn+F11.
