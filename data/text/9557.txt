Q: iCloud Why Are Some Album Tracks Uploaded Instead of Matched I know that iTunes Match is still in its infancy, but I'm having a weird occurrence. Most of my tracks are ripped from my CD collection.
Albums that were all ripped in one batch, some of the tracks show up as matched, while others had to be "uploaded." See the example below:

Any ideas?

A: If you notice in your screenshot, the files that were uploaded were ripped at 128kbps. This causes enough audio artifacts in the file to throw the acoustic fingerprinting that was used when iTunes Match first launched. It has since been improved and issues like this with lower bit rate files are now much less common.
