Q: Does the new iPod Touch (iOS 4.1 / 4 gen) require that you jail break it to use a Blue Tooth keyboard? I already have a BT keyboard and I don't really want to buy a new one, so my question is, will the BT keyboard I already have work with an ipod touch?
Or will I need to use a proprietary Apple solution for that?

A: A 4th generation iPod Touch (or an iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4) running iOS 4.1 supports third-party bluetooth keyboards.
