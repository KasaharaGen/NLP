Q: View IE (6,7,8,9) on Mac? I am a web developer. I would like to view my web design on IE(6 - latest). Is there a quick way to view it?
Thanks in advance
EDIT:
I already have a Windows OS on my Mac using VirtualBox. However, I dont want to load such heavy program just to preview IE :(
I need an alternative or faster way to view IE

A: Wine claims to support IE 6, 7, and 8 with varying levels of efficacy.
It's not a simple solution, but it sure is a hell of a lot lighter-weight then a VM, and it effectively runs the full browser on OSX.
You need to be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to get anywhere with Wine, though.
Crossover Mac is basically a MacOS GUI for wine. It has the same capabilities as wine, but the GUI makes installing things much easier. On the other hand, it's not free.

A: You can either install Windows as a virtual machine (eg. VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop) or on a Bootcamp partition. Note that this requires a Windows license and media for installing. In Windows you can then install IETester for example.
There are some online services that will make screenshots for you in said browsers like Adobe Browserlab (https://browserlab.adobe.com/). Though that might not be ideal when wanting to quickly debug some problems.
There are even services where you connect to a remote VNC instance running a selected Windows configuration like http://www.browsercam.com/. But those generally do not come free to my knowledge.

A: Buy a cheap used Windows XP Pro box (or rent a Windows VM from some cloud if you want to be more "green") and just leave it running.  Use a Remote Desktop or VNC viewer to view IE on it from your Mac.  No big load on your Mac and little boot up time if you just leave it running.

A: Microsoft actually has virtual machines you can download (Windows XP, Vista, and 7) just for testing IE compatibility: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575
This isn't a 'fast' solution but I think it is the best and supported solution. It is 'heavy' but I don't think there is a way around it. It is just part of the job if you need to support IE.

A: The website http://browsershots.org/ lets you preview a webpage in IE, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and other browsers on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and BSD.

A: http://browserling.com/ will let you try several browsers live, from the comfort of your browser. You get 10 minute sessions for free or you can buy a subscription.
It's made out of pure awesome.

A: possibly the best route out of all the options and a great tutorial
