Q: How do I convert FLIC files properly I need to open and convert old Autodesk Animator FLIC (.FLI) files (from MS DOS) into something more useful, like say AVI or even an image sequence. I realize both Motion and QuickTime "can" do this, but they mess up the films, probably because of a faulty decoder. 
I've already downloaded the UNIX app xnview, but it doesn't work well. While it can handle the format well, it can only store one frame at a time as a standalone picture, which is PAINFUL to do when there are usually several hundred frames in any given animation.

A: I don't know what you can do about converting the files....   However, if xnview will export the still frames to a folder, and if the files are sequentially numbered, QuickTime will be able to make a movie out of these images.  
Perhaps xnview can be scripted to export all of the still frames.
Will that work for you?

A: Maybe the command line tool ppm2fli which includes unflick?
DESCRIPTION

The program unflick extracts single images or a series of images from
  a given FLI-animation. The extracted images are stored in separated
  files. The formats PPM (raw and ascii) and FBM (mapped 8bpp) are
  available. Additionally unflick can call an external filter program to
  convert the output in another file format. The file animation contains
  the input FLI-animation. The output file names are controlled by the
  parameters base and extension...
