Q: Remote access to PowerPC Leopard Server I have a PowerMac G4 at my office running Leopard Server that I'd like to be able to access remotely. Normally, I'd just use VNC / SSH, but it's behind a router that I don't have admin access over (it's in the office next door and we're in a piggybacking agreement, I just don't feel like asking him to forward ports, etc). I think "Back To My Mac" generally can take care of this, but it's going away and you can't subscribe to MobileMe anymore anyhow.
Is there any software out there that can either UPnP it's way around this situation or somehow create an outbound connection? I suppose it being a PowerPC throws a wrench into the plan also.

A: Try PortMap -- it's free, universal binary (PPC and Intel), and supports a variety of routers.  Just have it map ports 22 (SSH) and 5900 (VNC).  Note: I'd recommend  using nonstandard public ports, to cut down on the number of password-guessing scans you'll get, and also making sure you don't have any accounts with easy-to-guess passwords (because you'll still get a few scans, no matter how creative you are with port numbers).

A: I've been using LogMeIn.com for all my remote Mac access. Works amazingly well. Totally free for basic use. No router or firewall changes are necessary.
