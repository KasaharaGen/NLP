Q: Wi-Fi auto-disconnect for iPhone? Is there an app to disconnect an iPhone from a Wi-Fi router at a specific time, other than just turning off Wi-Fi?

A: You may be able to configure the router to only allow WiFi access to the iPhone during certain times of day.  This isn't a connection timeout so much as a parental control over the time of day WiFi is allowed.  The setting is located in your routers admin interface.
