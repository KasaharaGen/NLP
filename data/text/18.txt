Q: Keyboard needs to be setup on every boot up I am being asked to setup my keyboard every time I reboot my computer. Is there anyway I can get this to keep the setup?
I am on Snow Leopard and have a Logitech Wave wireless keyboard and mouse combo. This started happening when I switched to 64-bit mode. Booting into 32-bit mode doesn't fix it.

A: Repair permissions: Run Disk Utility; select your (main) disk; click Repair Disk Permissions
Viewing logs: Run Console

A: Um, standard "stock" fixes:


*

*Repair permissions

*Check logs

*Erase (Logitech) software and reinstall


You could also see if it is actually saving the connection details (by finding the pref file) or it is unable to.
