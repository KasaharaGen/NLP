Q: Is there a Game Boy Color emulator for Lion? Is there a GBC emulator that will run on Lion? I've been in the mood for some nostalgic gaming recently, and I'd love to play some of the games from when I was younger.

Visual Boy advanced should work on Mac. I haven't personally tried it out, but if it's at all as good as their program for PC you'll be set.
Best of luck

A: VisualBoyAdvance is apparently a PowerPC Application that is able to run on Macs up to OS X Snow Leopard because those versions include a feature of being able to convert Power PC apps to Intel, which is what Macs are now with their Intel chipset. 
Unfortunately they took out this feature from OS X Lion so it now ONLY ACCEPTS Intel applications. Therefore VisualBoyAdvance will not work on OS X Lion since it is Power PC. I have Snow Leopard though, so I am currently enjoying a nice session of Pokemon on VisualBoyAdvance on my Mac. Hope this helps
