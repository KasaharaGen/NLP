Q: Can I sync drafts to gMail from iPhone mail? I have gmail set up via exchange. My drafts aren't syncing back to the server. Should they be? Is there a setting somewhere?

A: No, this is limitation of GMail via Exchange on iOS.
The only way to have draft support is to use the GMail template when adding a new mail account.
