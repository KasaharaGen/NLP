Q: How do I synchronize keychains between computers? I have two Macs running Lion on a home network that I use regularly, and I would like to keep my keychain files synchronized between them.
I add keychain entries on both machines, so I need to be able to merge (rather than overwrite) keychain files.
Is there a way to accomplish this?

A: There used to be, as MobileMe did keychain syncing. Indeed, that was the only reason I was a subscriber.
Since iCloud, that feature is no longer available. I now use 1Password for my password syncing. It isn't quite as good as keychain syncing (non-browser applications can't really use it), but for most stuff it's dandy.
