Q: Can iTunes ignore store credit and use a credit card instead? There are times when I've got some store credit from a gift card/certificate on iTunes, but I want to buy something without that. 
I want to buy something with the credit card, regardless of what's prepaid on the account.
Is this possible?

A: Sadly for you, iTunes uses credit in the store before using a credit card.

A: According to Apple's page, it uses the following order for song purchases:


*

*Song credits.

*Gift certificate, prepaid card, or allowance credits.

*Credit cards.


Thus, it would appear that you cannot charge a credit card without using up your credits or gift certificates first.
However, similar to what @Nick said, you could just open up another account, add the credit card to it, and then gift the items you want to your original account.
Update: Based on my own tests of self-gifting, these are my findings:


*

*Gifts will deduct money from the credit card on your account; they will not use up song credits nor gift card credit. This means that you do not need to open another account, just add it as a credit card and gift it to yourself.

*You cannot send a gift to the same email address as your iTunes account. This can easily be circumvented by sending it to one of your other email accounts.

*The easiest method of gifting to yourself is to select the print option. It will show you a code which you then use to redeem the song. It will allow you to redeem the code on the same account.


A: I think if you "gift" something you will use a credit card instead of store credit since you can't buy a gift with store credit.
