Q: Replace German keyboard of Macbook Pro MC700 I have a German Macbook Pro, but I dont really like the keyboard layout, I would like to replace about 15 keys to make it easier for typing. Is it possible to do so ? And where can I find the black cover of the key (Do I need to buy the white scissors below the black cover as well ???) 

A: You can replace the entire keyboard. See how to tear down macbook pro unibody.
