Q: What are some good resources for learning Dashcode? What are some good resources for learning Dashcode? I've got plenty for XCode, but can neither find a good online Dashcode tutorial nor a book in stores. If anyone can help, please let me know.
My apologies if this is better suited for SO.

A: There are a bunch of resources available from the Apple Developer Site.
Here is a small list of stuff available:
Dashboard Widget Tutorial
Mobile Safari Web Application Tutorial
Starting a Project

A: Maybe you've already checked and didn't like it or something, but the included help documentation is actually a pretty good starting point for creating simple widgets in Dashcode.  It got me through coding a couple easy ones.  Not sure if you're looking for complete beginner tutorials or something more advanced however.
