Q: Sending email with images on iPad? I've just realized I can't send images from Mail on Ipad.
When a create a new draft there is not add image functionality, so I guess the only way is to email images from Photos.
However, what if I want to send an email with more than one image ?
thanks

A: From the Photo app you can select up to 5 images and hit Share -> E-Mail.
Maybe it's possible to mail more then 5 images when you select 5+ and the Copy them and Paste them in your E-Mail.
See this guide for reference: Send multiple photos at once on the iPad and iPhone

A: Tapping on the icon will display more options, such as bulk copy or delete.

Note: I reply becoz I can't add images to @timbooo comment.
