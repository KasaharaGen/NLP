Q: How can I see the system status during boot? I would like to monitor the messages generated when I boot my Mac, similar to what you on a *nix box. Is there key-combo to press/hold that will let me do this?

A: You have to press cmd + v upon startup to see the boot output. Press this right after the chime. 
If you want to make that permanent, you should probably do something along the lines of: 
sudo nvram boot-args="-v"

To undo the above:
sudo nvram boot-args=

in the Terminal. (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)
note: I haven’t tested the above commands, but I’m sure a google query will help you there if you want to make it permanent.

A: If you want to see the boot messages after the boot occurred, log in and run sudo dmesg in Terminal.app.
