A: After backing up your system, insert your shiny OS X DVD into your Mac and restart the computer, holding down C, so that the Mac boots off of the DVD-ROM.
After a few moments, you will be presented with a installation screen and presented with a number of options.

A: What Apple laptop you have?
You can simple slide your CD and start the instllation program and it will check for compatibility and if your Laptop is compatible it will upgrade it.
