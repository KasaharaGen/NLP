Q: Folders in Applications not in sync with Launchpad I created a folder in /Applications to move all Games into a folder called Games. Launchpad is not in sync with the folders that I created. 
Looking at the folder Utilities, I was under the impression that creating a folder in /Applications would keep Launchpad in sync . 
Is there a way to keep these two distinct Applications (LaunchPad and Finder) which show me a list apps to respect the folders hierarchy ? 

A: The two hierarchies are separate, and cannot be kept in sync without third-party intervention. Even then, there would be difficulties. Note that Launchpad folders have capacity limits that actual folders do not have, and folders within /Applications can contain nested folders, while Launchpad folders cannot.
It's just a coincidence that the apps in /Applications/Utilities match up with the Utilities folder in Launchpad. On my machine, I moved Terminal out of the Utilities folder in Launchpad, but it's still /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
