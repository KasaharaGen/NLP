Q: Using Garage Band sounds for commercial purposes Im making a Drumming app for the iphone and the ipod touch.
I was searching for good drum samples around the internet, but couldn't find anything fitting. Then i thought of garageband and its drum kits which contained the samples that i needed.
Will apple allow me to use the garageband's kit sounds separatly and for commercial purposes?

A: Actually, you can't. The linked article specifies exactly that you can't:

to create your own original music
  compositions or audio projects. You
  may broadcast and/or distribute your
  own music compositions or audio
  projects that were created using the
  Audio Content, however, individual
  audio loops may not be commercially or
  otherwise distributed on a standalone
  basis, nor may they be repackaged in
  whole or in part as audio samples,
  sound effects or music beds."

(emphasis mine)
You can create as many songs as you want using all the sounds you have in the loops and sell the songs. But you will be packaging the sounds (or repackaging) as audio samples of your application which seems to be forbidden.

A: No you can not - what you ask is akin to distributing the loops on a standalone basis as loops. But you're free to incorporate them into your own commercial works. There's an Apple KB article on it: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2931
