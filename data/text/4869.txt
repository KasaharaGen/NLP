Q: Is there a way to reset my iphone 4 to fix this problem All of a sudden, my Voice Control on my iphone 4 keeps beeping and making noises, and it's starting songs on the music player and making the whole phone go haywire.
I turned the phone off and on again but the problem persists. Is there a way to replace the whole system or do something else that might fix it
The phone was working perfectly yesterday and every other day since last October when I bought it

A: It sounds like a reset is probably the most likely thing to fix this. It will reset your iPhone to factory settings, and then put back your settings and media from a backup.
You can rest your iPhone by connecting it to iTunes, selecting it in the sidebar, going to the General tab, and clicking Restore.
Take a look at the Restoring Your iPhone section of this Apple support document for more info.

A: Before you go down the full Restore route double check that restoring it to basic content and settings (Settings -> General -> Reset) doesn't help. It's fixed a few things for me before.
