Q: Disable / Uninstall Mail app in Lion I'm running Sparrow mail client and would love to disable Mail.app, which keeps opening from time to time.

A: You could try selecting the Mail icon in the Applications folder, select Get Info (âŒ˜I), and under permissions, set Everyone to no access. That should prevent the program from launching.

A: From Apple Support, the steps to switch to a different mail reader are:


*

*Open Mail (/Applications/Mail)

*From the Mail menu, choose Preferences

*Click the General button

*Choose your desired default email application from the "Default email reader" pop-up menu.

To change the default email application, use Webmailer. This Apple.SE post has several answers that discuss the use of this utility.

A: I think you can uninstall the mail app using [CleanMyMac.  I did this on an older version of OSX without any problems afterwards.
