Q: Where is "Get Info" in Xcode 4.2? I have problems publishing my Application in the App Store. 
It seem that the UI has been updated, but the tutorial I use still uses the old version of Xcode, and I can't follow the instructions to publish my application.
Where can I find the Get Info window in Xcode 4.2?

A: Select your project in the right sidebar, then select the project in the main area above your targets. You'll find the configurations under the tab 'info'.
