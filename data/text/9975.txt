Q: How do I disable the drop shadow from text on the Desktop? Does anyone know how to get rid of the text drop shadow from files and folders on the Mac desktop?
I would prefer a subtle shadow with an offset of 1 pixel.
  
If you know of a hack to get rid of the drop shadow completely, please share!

A: I don't think it exists as a setting. You could go around the problem by using a black or dark background.

A: You can experiment with modifying system font settings using the free utility TinkerTool. Note that with the Fonts panel open in Tinkertool, you can specify font shadow settings.
I don't know what results you might achieve, since the Mac OS prevents you from over-riding certain settings.

You can use TinkerTool to reset any settings you change to the system default.
