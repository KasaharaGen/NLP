Q: How to learn a wireless router's MAC address I am using Mac OS X Lion. How can I learn the MAC address of a wireless router that is listed in the wireless network list?

A: We can use the system_profiler command.
system_profiler  SPNetworkDataType | grep RouterHardwareAddress

Sample output:
Network Signature: IPv4.Router=10.104.26.1;IPv4.RouterHardwareAddress=00:10:db:ff:81:70


A: Another way out is you can get the MAC address associated with an IP address. In your case, you need to find your router's IP address. Normally, it's your Default Gateway. You can do all of these using the command lines.
First, you need to get your Default Gateway. Type netstat -nr | grep default. The output should show something like this:
default            192.168.1.1        UGSc           31        0     en1

From that, you could pretty sure that your router's IP address is 192.168.1.1. Then, you must find the MAC address associated to this IP by using arp -a | grep 192.168.1.1 command. The output will show you the router's MAC address.
? (192.168.1.1) at 0:c:42:64:bd:10 on en1 ifscope ...

Hope that help :)

A: Option-click on the Wi-Fi icon. Once the menu appears, press Option again. Now when you hover over any network a tooltip with the MAC address (BSSID) will appear after a short delay.

A: Method 1:
Get the router's IP first, then use arp -a to find out the MAC address.
You can get the router's IP by this command
echo "show State:/Network/Global/IPv4" | scutil | grep Router

or
ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep router

Method 2:
Get the service UUID of your Wi-Fi first
echo "show State:/Network/Global/IPv4" | scutil | grep PrimaryService

then get the MAC address by the service UUID
echo "show State:/Network/Service/<service UUID>/IPv4" | scutil | grep ARPResolvedHardwareAddress
