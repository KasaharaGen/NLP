Q: Force autocomplete form save on iPad While on some websites, iPad Safari automatically asks to save form data like Us/Pwd, on other pages, it never asks for the same.
How can we force it to ask for form data save on any website?

A: Add the following bookmarklet to safari:
javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20ca,cea,cs,df,dfe,i,j,x,y;function%20n(i,what)%7Breturn%20i+%22%20%22+what+((i==1)?%22%22:%22s%22)%7Dca=cea=cs=0;df=document.forms;for(i=0;i%3Cdf.length;++i)%7Bx=df%5Bi%5D;dfe=x.elements;if(x.onsubmit)%7Bx.onsubmit=%22%22;++cs;%7Dif(x.attributes%5B%22autocomplete%22%5D)%7Bx.attributes%5B%22autocomplete%22%5D.value=%22on%22;++ca;%7Dfor(j=0;j%3Cdfe.length;++j)%7By=dfe%5Bj%5D;if(y.attributes%5B%22autocomplete%22%5D)%7By.attributes%5B%22autocomplete%22%5D.value=%22on%22;++cea;%7D%7D%7Dalert(%22Removed%20autocomplete=off%20from%20%22+n(ca,%22form%22)+%22%20and%20from%20%22+n(cea,%22form%20element%22)+%22,%20and%20removed%20onsubmit%20from%20%22+n(cs,%22form%22)+%22.%20After%20you%20type%20your%20password%20and%20submit%20the%20form,%20the%20browser%20will%20offer%20to%20remember%20your%20password.%22)%7D)();

You will need to know how to manipulate an existing bookmark to paste this small program in the place a bookmark normally has the URL. This is exactly how programs like Instapaper and Pocket and others use a bookmarklet (which is really a program stored as a bookmark) to change or act on the page you are currently browsing.
Since you should always be a little suspicious when someone posts a program for you to run - here is a clearer version that shows we just loop over all the elements and blindly turn on autocomplete for each.
This makes up for web developers that forgot or intentionally did not enable autocomplete.

Same script as above, but nicely formatted and without the bookmarklet wrapper:
function () {
    var ca, cea, cs, df, dfe, i, j, x, y;

    function n(i, what) {
        return i " "
        what((i == 1) ? "" : "s")
    }
    ca = cea = cs = 0;
    df = document.forms;
    for (i = 0; i < df.length; i) {
        x = df[i];
        dfe = x.elements;
        if (x.onsubmit) {
            x.onsubmit = "";
            cs;
        }
        if (x.attributes["autocomplete"]) {
            x.attributes["autocomplete"].value = "on";
            ca;
        }
        for (j = 0; j < dfe.length; j) {
            y = dfe[j];
            if (y.attributes["autocomplete"]) {
                y.attributes["autocomplete"].value = "on";
                cea;
            }
        }
    }
    alert("Removed autocomplete=off from "
    n(ca, "form")" and from "
    n(cea, "form element")", and removed onsubmit from "
    n(cs, "form")". After you type your password and submit the form, the browser will offer to remember your password.")
