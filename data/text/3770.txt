Q: FTP sites open in Finder instead of in Safari I cannot log into FTP sites on my iMac (Intel Core i5, 2.8GHz, running OS X 10.6.7).
I probably created the problem when I installed Firefox and it took over as the default browser. I changed the default back to Safari, but then every time I try to log into the FTP at school (ftp://sws.pcc.edu), Firefox launched instead. I found a utility that said it would allow me to control internet protocol associations, which it kinda did. I tried to set Safari back to FTP but now FTP's open in Finder.
How do get things back to allowing me to login to FTP sites in Safari?

A: Safari does not support browsing FTP sites (displaying directory listings). Given a ftp: URL for a specific file, it will display or download it, but URLs for directories will be passed to the Finder instead.

A: Try this freeware app called MisFox.  It will allow you to change the protocol helper for FTP.

A: Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist.
Open the file up in a text editor (any will do) - if you have Property List Editor installed, I'd still recommend a text editor, as it makes the next step easier.
Do a quick find in the document for "ftp" - once you've got the entry, it should look something like this:

<dict>
<key>LSHandlerRoleAll </key>
<string>com.panic.transmit </string>
<key>LSHandlerURLScheme </key>
<string>ftp </string>
</dict>

For me, Transmit is set to handle FTP. Change that line to com.apple.safari, save the file, and give it a shot. Make a backup first. Hope this helps.
