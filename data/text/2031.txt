Q: Why has Snow Leopard screwed up my Safari and my desktop's ability to stay organized Ever since I installed snow leopard I get multiple safari crashes per day. And my desktop refuses to stay organized (by date modified)?

A: Sounds like you did an upgrade, perhaps with the help Migration Assistant?
Best way to deal with it?  Back up your data, and either
i) create a new account, pulling your data back in, but with a fresh library and settings or, better yet,
ii) reformat, re-install OS and create your account again, from scratch.  Pull the data in manually.
Upgrading, and/or migration assistant, often doesn't go well when automated.  Just the nature of the beast. If you're not entirely comfortable doing this, get a pro to do it.  Trust me.
