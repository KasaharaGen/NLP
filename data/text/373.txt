Q: LaunchBar/Quicksilver as a replacement of Spotlight? I asked about the usefulness of spotlight here, as I don't like the drag that spotlight causes all the time.
What I found useful in Spotlight is those two.


*

*word lookup : spotlight opens 'Dictionary' App automatically when it can look the word up.

*search for PDF 


And one of the answer that I got is from 'Dan Ray' saying "Personally, I disable it in favor of Quicksilver.".
I don't use Quicksilver, but LaunchBar, but it seems to me that LaunchBar doesn't look up the pdf. And, furthermore, it has an option to search in Spotlight.
and My questions are 


*

*Can LaunchBar can do the two things? Look into Dictionary, and pdf search?

*Can QuickSilver can do the two things?


If one of the tools can do that, I guess I just disable Spotlight, and enjoy the speedup.
