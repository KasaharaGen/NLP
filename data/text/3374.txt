Q: How to clean up duplicates in iTunes library? How do I remove duplicate songs from my iTunes library?
Is there an easier way than just ⌘ Command + Click every other song in the list?

A: Apple doesn't have anything natively to select duplicate files so, unfortunately, you'll have to resort to a paid solution like Dupin or you could try Randy's Träume's script.
I haven't used either so I can't vouch for how well they work, but forums I found relating to this problem point to Dupin frequently so that might be your best bet if you don't mind spending a little coin.

A: iTunes does have a way to show duplicate songs, in your library and in playlists.
File > Display Duplicates
Remember that the playlist has to contain more than one track/video/podcast for the "Display Duplicates" option to show.

A: I am very happy with Corral iTunes Dupes script, which I downloaded from Doug’s Scripts years ago. It seems to be gone now, but I found a modification here.

However, it’s a PPC app (pretty old!), which you have to convert to Intel architecture by dragging it to AppleScript Editor.app and saving it as Application. You only have to do this once. 

A: Dupin is worth paying for if you are not comfortable working with AppleScripts (which are straightforward in any event)
