Q: Recording video to MacBook Pro I have an RCA feed with video. I'd like to capture this video to my Mac. I am looking for a mobile solution, something that does not require a wall plug, although battery power is OK. What methods exist to capture video on a laptop?
Here is a solution (mini portable VCR) that does not use a computer, but if I can get it into my Mac for around that price, it would be preferred.

A: The Elgato Video Capture takes video from a standard 3-plug RCA feed and records it to your Mac or PC in H.264 (they provide the recording software). It is USB-powered. $99 list, $79 Amazon.
