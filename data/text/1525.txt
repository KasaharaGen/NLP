Q: Configure mail client for Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 Adobe Acrobat plugin 9.4.0 has File | Attach to Email ..., but selecting it yields the following:

The SendMail doesn't know how to talk
  to your default mail client.  Please
  select a different mail application to
  use.

How does the user select which mail application for SendMail to use, and which mail applications does SendMail know how to use?

A: I believe it looks to see which is your default mail app.  I also think that it will pretty much only work with Mail.app.  If you go into Mail.app, check which is the default email app (and re-set it, if required) on the Preferences -> General screen.  I bet setting it to Mail will fix your problem.
