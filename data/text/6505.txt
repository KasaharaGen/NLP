Q: Can I stream media from one Plex server to another Plex server? I have Plex on a laptop and I can use Plex for the iDevices to stream media to them.
Can I do the same with Plex on another computer around the house like ZumoCast?

A: Any device with the plex front end, ie, iDevice, apple TV, LG medialink, & apple computers, can see any Plex server that is running on your local network.

A: I believe so, just login Plex on another computer, and access it, you can stream media date from Plex to your iDevices.
