Q: Loose light up apple logo on unibody macbook case The light-up Apple logo inset into on the back of my 13" Unibody MacBook (this thing) has come loose and is recessed into the lid. Is there a way to get inside the lid to reattach that piece? Thanks for any help!

A: iFixit has directions on opening the lid: Installing Front Display Bezel.It requires their $3 Spudger tool.
