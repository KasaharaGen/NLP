Q: best way to backup a jailbroken iphone 3gs? I want to be able to backup my apps, sources and themes so that i can still do restores without having to go through the whole process everytime. I am a tinkerer, and sometimes I break stuff. I need a way out!!

A: Have you checked out pkgbackup on cydia? It has worked for me.
