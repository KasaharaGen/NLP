Q: Is there any virtual machine which works on a PPC Mac running 10.4? Is there any virtual machine which works on a PPC (non-Intel) Mac 10.4? I am killing myself finding a virtual machine for Mac 10.4. Everything that I found needs an Intel Mac.

A: The primary solution for PowerPC Macs was Microsoft's now-defunct Virtual PC.  It was discontinued several years ago, so you'll really have to do some digging to find a copy.  (Be warned -- it runs slow as molasses.  You'd probably be better off buying a cheap PC.)
There's also Q emulator, which supposedly runs on PowerPC, but I have never tried it.

A: There is a download link for Virtual PC 7 on this video that you may try.
If you're really desperate, the Darwine project released a few experimental builds of Wine that worked on PPC several years ago, but the project was dropped due to very poor performance, and I expect that you need to do a lot of hacking to get a program up-and-runningâ€¦

A: Om my PPC PowerMac G3 I did have one installed the copy from my friend however the machine had a kernel issue due to trying to install a modified OS X Leopard and I had to restore the disk. Although I cannot remember the name I can assure you there is one and this one worked with XP which surprised me considering that XP is Intel and above XXDD.
