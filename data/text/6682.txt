Q: MS Office 2011: Plugging Excel Data Into a Word Document (Note: I'm am not sure if this question fits in this StackExchange site, so please correct me if it doesn't belong)
To cut my problem short: I'm trying to make a Word document which prints data from a Excel document.  Is it possible to link an Excel and Word document?  Almost like this:
Data A(A,1)
Data B(A,2)
etc.

I have tried using templates and just simply printing the excel document without the lines, but my "requirements" are too specific and complex.

A: Yes, it is. I don't know exactly what you are doing, but doing a mail merge should link a Word document to an Excel spreadsheet. Let me know what you are using it for, and I can post further instructions.
