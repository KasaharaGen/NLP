Q: Lingon open source version for editing launchd on Leopard (10.5)? I'm looking for a free GUI app to help run programs on a schedule.  It seems that launchd is the underlying tool to use, and in the past Lingon has been recommended as a good GUI interface to launchd.
But now it seems that the open source (Apache License V2.0) version of Lingon 1.2.1 doesn't work on Leopard (10.5), and the newest version of Lingon (2.2.1) requires Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 or later and is no longer open source.
Has anyone gotten a version of Lingon to run on Leopard (10.5)?
Or is there another free alternative?
Update - thanks to Mark I found and tried 2.1.1 which seems to work.  But it requires a restart or logout when making a change - is that always needed for launchd?  Or just for Lingon?  If so, cron with the cronnix GUI seems like it would be much easier to use.

A: Sourceforge has all the previous versions.
