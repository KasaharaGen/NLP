Q: Is there a key stroke to switch to a fullscreen app in Lion? I normally switch around my virtual desktops using the ctrl+num. Now, ExposÃ© shows all the desktops and the fullscreen app whereupon clicking the fullscreen app rectangle will take me back to it. I'd rather do so via keyboard nav. cmd+tab doesn't work for me because I'm doing this with VMware where I have multiple windows open, one is fullscreen, others are not. cmd+tab seems to land me on whatever VMware window it randomly chooses.

A: You can configure these shortcuts in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control
I think the default is control-option-left/right arrow, at least that's what I have it set to.
In mission control, you can also re-order the position of the desktops/full screen apps by dragging them around. I think by default they're ordered by most-recently used desktop, but you can change that (I can't remember how, that would be a separate question anyway).

A: By default it's Command+Control+F. 
However, it doesn't work in all apps. Some don't do full screen and some pre-Lion apps retain their original full-screen keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Command-Shift-F in Firefox).
