Q: Why isn't iPhone Mail working right with Google Apps Email? I am having a big problem with my iPhone's Mail App. For some reason, emails are not going to my iPhone. I have all of my settings right and I have IMAP on in settings and this still keeps popping up: 

I followed all of the steps on this page for Google Apps users and nothing will work, this used to work and all of a sudden it quit working. I have a lot of emails that are coming to my email account online but my iPhone mail hasn't been working for a while now. (hence the last update at the bottom in my screenshot above, 9/5/11)
Does anyone know what would cause this? 

A: Have you tried removing the account and then adding it again? (This may help if some setting has become corrupted. doing so will force iOS to start a "fresh slate" for the account.)
