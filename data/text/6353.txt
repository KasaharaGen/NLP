Q: X11 application from 'administrator' account Call me paranoid but my everyday account has no privileges.
I have a 'administrator' account who is in wheel. When I want to perform administrative tasks, I open a terminal and do
su - administrator
sudo ...

This works fine in most situations, except with X11 applications.
sudo xeyes

fails with

Can't open display:

What I've tried:


*

*start X11 with the everyday user

*do xhost +localhost with everyday user

*do export DISPLAY=:0 with administrator


How can I run a X11 application with the administrator account when my desktop runs with the everyday user?

A: Perhaps ssh -X to localhost?
