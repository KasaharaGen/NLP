Q: What's a reliable method to create a stand alone recovery disk for Lion? I'm seeing a lot of questions with all sorts of steps to burn a DVD or create a USB disk so you can boot your Mac with Lion if the internal drive is replaced.
Is there a definitive set of steps that is best in terms of support, reliability and cost?

A: A 3rd party utility that creates bootable DVD or USB/hard drive installers for OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 is:  LionDiskMaker.

A: This might help

"The Lion Recovery Disk Assistant lets you create Lion Recovery on an external drive that has all of the same capabilities as the built-in Lion Recovery: reinstall Lion, repair the disk using Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, or browse the web with Safari."
