Q: How can I prevent accidentally quitting an application? I use Adium, but if I set a "Quit Confirmation" in the advanced preferences, it cancels log out. If I don't, it is way too easy to quit it, since it gets focused between apps sometimes.
Is there any way I can have a "Quit Confirmation" show up when I try to quit Adium, except when I am logging out or shutting down the OS?


A: You can do the following to make it a little bit harder to quit Adium by accident. I think this should solve your problem.
Start by opening System Preferences > Keyboard.



*

*Click Keyboard Shortcuts in the pillbox above.

*Make sure you have Application Shortcuts selected in the left bar.

*Click the + button to add a new shortcut.





*Select Adium from the Application dropdown.

*Type "Quit" in the menu title field.

*Put your cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut field and type Command-Option-Q

*Click Add



And you're done. You can close your System Preferences because the Quit command in Adium has been remapped to a less-likely-to-be-accidentally-typed shortcut.
