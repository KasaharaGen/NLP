Q: Does apple get any payment for the Wired magazine viewer App? If you are subscribed to Wired magazine (paid subscription) you can download the Wired iPad app free and enter your Subscription # and view it on the iPad.

A: No, Apple doesn't get any payment this way. There are a lot of newspapers, magazines etc. providing apps which allow electronic access. If they would offer in-app purchases Apple would take the usual 30%.
