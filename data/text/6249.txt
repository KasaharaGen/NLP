Q: How to undelete notes on iPhone "Notes" app? iPhone has a default "Notes" app which allows us to store notes. Stored notes can be deleted by hitting the "Delete Note" button:

How do we recover a note that is accidentally deleted?
Is there anyway to undo the delete?

A: There is a way to undo the delete.  You just have to shake your iphone, and this will activate the "undo" feature which seems to have been forgotten by most people (it was a feature of an iOS update a few revisions back around 2009).

A: Apple solved this issue with an upgrade to iCloud and notes.app
There is now a deleted items folder that you can access on iOS within the notes app. 

Just head to the Recently Deleted folder to recover your deleted work.

A: If you have an iTunes backup, you can browse it with Doctor Telephone and maybe recover notes iphone again.
The linked app works only for Mac, but here's two alternatives (not tested) :


*

*iPhone backup extractor which is a paid multiplatform app

*iphonebackupbrowser which is less polished and windows only, but free.


A: If you sync your notes with Google, try looking for them in your Gmail's trash folder!
