Q: How do you use Google Voice instead of built-in text message with Siri on iPhone4S? I would like to use the Google Voice app instead of the built-in Text Messages with Siri on the iPhone 4S.
Is this possible and how?

A: No, it is currently not possible for Siri to use other apps than the ones it already integrates with.
