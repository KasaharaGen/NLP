Q: MobileMe iDisk Folders  What are the following (default) iDisk folders used for:


*

*Backup

*Groups

*Library

*Sites

*Software

*Web


If you delete them and wait a few minutes they will re-appear, but I do not know what they are used for. There is a document in them explaining their use, but it is still not clear.

A: *

*Backup is used by the MobileMe Backup application. I don't recommend using it.  

*Groups is for a now defunct Groups feature that they used to have.  

*Library is used for MobileMe's syncing feature - primarily for Preferences and Bookmarks.  

*Sites is used for webpages or anything you want shared at http://homepage.mac.com/username/. Note: PHP files, CGI files, etc. don't work. It only works with static content.

*Software contains free software provided by Apple to MobileMe customers (eg. the Backup application) - this doesn't affect your disk usage.

*Web is a folder used by iWeb - otherwise it's nearly identical to the Sites folder but is available at http://web.me.com/username
