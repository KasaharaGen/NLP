Q: "Remove personal information" default save in Office for Mac 2011? Is anyone aware of a way of setting Office for Mac 2011 to automatically use the "remove personal information" option on every save?

A: The best way I can see of doing this is to modify or create a new blank template with the setting baked in. 


*

*File -> New From Template -> Blank
Document 

*Make Privacy changes as
before

*Save as Word Template (This will normally appear under my Templates, but I presume you could overwrite the existing Blank template, wherever it is located).

*Then when creating a new document, use the new template you created.
