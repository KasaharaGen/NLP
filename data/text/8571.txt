Q: Can anyone recommend good third party iOS email clients (especially regarding signature support)? Can anyone recommend an iOS email client (Exchange/ActiveSync or IMAP... preferably both) that supports really sweet email signatures?  Our company email signature has an official format that has a base64 encoded image and a standardized font/color.
Please, throw me some suggestions!

A: Sparrow is now available for the iPhone, and it supports IMAP. 
The app description does not mention exchange, and it specifically says that there's no POP support, but being that it's such a popular mail client, I figured it's worth mentioning. 
Disclaimer: I've never used it either on the Mac or on iOS

A: Moxier
This is an email client which supports Exchange ActiveSync in the AppStore. But I'm not sure it supports sweet email signatures.

A: Outlook Mail is pretty good and supports signatures.  The problem I've run into is that it doesn't support saved searches (As far as I can Tell) or unread search.

A: Try "Touchdown" for iOS, available in the App Store. 

A: try Mail+ for Outlook by iKonic Apps...best email client out there
