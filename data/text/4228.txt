Q: Mac won't boot: Way to mount drive and delete one file? My macbook is currently a brick. I added a /etc/launchctl.conf file that must be malformed. The OS now crashes even when attempting to start in safe mode:
"launchd System bootstrapper has crashed: Seg fault"
I tried booting from a 10.6 boot CD but it just spun and spun. I have been able to boot an Ubuntu Live CD and mount the mac partition, but the hfsplus partition is always mounted read-only.
There must be an Apple utility I can use to get to a live terminal and delete this single file that is preventing my laptop from booting? If I can get the OSX install CD to boot will there be a utility that can help me?

A: You can boot into single user mode by holding Command + s at startup.
Single user mode starts you directly at the console, bypassing core Mac OS X startup processes. You should be able to remove or alter the offending file from there.

A: Don't forget there's always Target Disk Mode, too. Start the Mac and hold down T until a Firewire icon appears - you now have the world's most expensive external hard drive. :) Plug into another Mac (or a Windows PC, maybe?) and you can access the hard drive on the machine in Target Disk Mode.
(Note that this doesn't work on Macs without Firewire. Mac Book Air users, you're bang out of luck.)

A: Start in single-user mode (like that other guy said). It'll say "If you wish to make modifications to files:" and give you two lines of commands. Type the second one, or type the first one for a File System Check, then press Enter. Then, if you want to delete a file (let's call it "brokenfile"), type (without quotes): "rm brokenfile", then press Enter.

A: I used a Microsoft install disk erased my hard drive and started over. Problem solved for me. I already had what I needed backed up on an external harddrive.
