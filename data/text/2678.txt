Q: iTerm2.app stopped working Since a couple of hours, when I try to run iTerm2.app, it opens a window, says 
## exec failed ##
login No such file or directory

and closes rather fast. Running Terminal.app works and if I run /Applications/iTerm2.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm from it it works just fine. Any ideas what's going on or how to fix it?

A: Sounds like your Default terminal has it's initial working directory set to some directory that no longer exists.
Try trashing your iTerm2 settings and starting from scratch. To delete your bookmarks and all other settings move the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist to the Trash.

A: The problem was .MacOSX/environment.plist. I didn't expected it to be the problem because I changed several days ago, but it seems it doesn't get re-loaded until you reboot.
I'm not 100% sure, but I think the problem was that I was trying to use the PATH variable to define it, I had this:
PATH => $PATH:/another/one

I've replaced that with a complete path and no $PATH variable, rebooted and now it's working.
