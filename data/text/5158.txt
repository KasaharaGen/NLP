Q: accidentally set my main folder as shared in public place I just figured my main folder under my user and everything in it was shared. Is there a log on my computer that checks whether someone downloaded from my computer? I remember there was somebody else with a mac on the same network and had the opportunity to download all my private information.
Thanks 

A: I don't think that there is a method to do that. Anyhow, I bet that the chances of that happening are very small. First, the person would have to have no morals, and second, the person would have had to specifically look for a shared folder, and that is also relatively unlikely. Also, just to be safe, monitor what can be monitored to discover whether your information was taken for a few days/weeks.
