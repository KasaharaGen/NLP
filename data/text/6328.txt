Q: MacBook Pro can't output to Panasonic HDTV (P60GT30)? I have a new 15" MacBook Pro running Lion.  My client has a new 60" Panasonic (P60GT30) in their conference room. 
They have a Windows laptop plugged in to the PC input, and it works fine.
However, when I try to connect like ...
MacBookProThunderboltPort -> Apple MiniDisplayPort-to-VGA dongle -> VGA cable -> TV's PC input 

... the MacBook simply will not recognize the TV.
(Note: The TV actually has a little VGA-to-weirdPanasonicMiniConnector dongle that's needed to connect the TV; but Windows worked fine with it, why not the MacBook?) 
Is there something I need to do for the MacBook to recognize and output to this TV?  Maybe a new driver or something?

A: You may require a TV that has a native HDMI input. VGA is becoming unsupported in many configurations, such as with the iPad 2, and all through the industry, not just with Apple products.

A: There appears to be no way to do what I need.  I'm adding this and marking it 'correct' because I don't want to look like a douche who doesn't mark answers as correct. :(
