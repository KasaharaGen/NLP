Q: Disabling default keyboard on iPad with iOS 4.2 I have enabled 3 languages and use their keyboards, but the default keyboard still insists on popping up. Bought in Bangkok, using in Europe.Can I disable this unnecessary keyboard or am I stuck with it??

A: *

*Go into Settings -> General -> Keyboard

*Tap Edit

*Tap and hold the "handle" (it looks like three horizontal bars) on English and drag it to the bottom


Or you can disable it outright.
