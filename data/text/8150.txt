Q: How do I restore my lost Address Book entries on my iPhone? My mom just got a new iPhone 4S today, so she wanted me to transfer the contacts on her old iPhone 3G to the 4S. However, I screwed up.
And I don't have a single backup, so now, all I have is a copy of the contacts on her computer, and no real contacts.
Do any of you know how to fix this? Restore the old data?

A: Check if she's stored the contacts anywhere else, such as in Hotmail, Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.  You can pull them into the phone by linking an account in Settings, Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Add Account..., or you can synchronize with the PC by going through the iPhone options in iTunes.
Otherwise, start typing...
