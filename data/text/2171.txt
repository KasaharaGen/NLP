Q: How to completely remove Folx on Mac OS X? I installed Folx download manager on my MacBook Pro. I didn't like it, so I removed it from the Applications folder. I also searched for its dependent files in /Library/Preferences, but I found nothing related to Folx. 
Now, when I try to download files, it tries to download using Folx—but Folx doesn't work. How can I fix this problem?

A: For prior version than Folx 4
Go Download the Folx.dmg from their website, and open it. In the dmg image, there will be a package file called uninstaller. Run that.
It is only for prior versions than Folx 4, as said by Eltima Software. For Folx 4 or newer, it is mentionned on their website that it is enough to remove Folx.app to permanently remove it.

A: I use 10.8.5 and here how it is to remove folx completely

A: If you use Firefox you should also unistall Folx plugin (Tools->Add-ons->Plugins->Folx Downloader Netscape plug-in -> disable)

A: To remove Folx you are to use its uninstaller.

A: the uninstaller did not work for me at all. I had to remove many pieces from the file system. I think the key was to remove the app from ~user/Library/ScriptingAdditions!

A: Open the Applications folder in Finder, select the app and drag it to Trash (located at the end of Dock). Then choose Finder → Empty Trash. When you empty the trash, the app is permanently removed from your Mac.

A: Download official uninstaller below: (Thanks Gilles for the comment)
