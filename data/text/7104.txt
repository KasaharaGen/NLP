Q: Did the calculator widget break in Lion? I seem unable to send a "clear" button press from the number pad on my standard apple extended keyboard (aluminum) to the calculator widget in Dashboard on Lion. The regular calculator app works as expected. Strangely, nothing on the internet seems to indicate a known bug.

A: I wrote a fix for this bug. Check my article for details.
