Q: Is it possible to use Image Capture to scan over WiFi with an EPSON SX620FW, and how to set that up? I'm wondering whether it's possible to use Image Capture to scan over WiFi with my EPSON All-in-One SX620FW? If so, how can I set it up?
I've found instructions from someone claiming it works with their EPSON PX710W, but I haven't been able to replicate these. I can scan without problems over WiFi using the bundled EPSON Scan application, but am wondering if and how I could use Image Capture instead.

A: I've got an NX420, and I can use the scanner with Image Capture over WiFi. What did it for me was installing the drivers that came on the CD (the ones Apple included didn't do it, and neither did the ones on the Epson website).
You might try that.

A: Software Update provided me with an update for EPSON printers today and now I can use my EPSON SX620FW to scan over WiFi with Image Capture, no additional setup needed (apart from adding the device in the Print&Fax system preferences panel)!
The update is also available through Apple's website:
