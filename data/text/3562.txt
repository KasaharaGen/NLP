Why isn't my MacBook running 64 bit mode? It's a mid-2010 model, "MacBook 7,1" , with a Core-2 Duo. why would it run in 32-bit mode? Could it be because I've only got 2GB of RAM?


A: I don't think these machines booted into 64bit. (the new macbook pros do).
You can hold down 6 and 4 whilst rebooting for a temporary 64bit boot (if available)
If that works, you can try this in terminal and then reboot
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot 'Kernel Flags' 'arch=x86_64'

This will make the mac boot in 64bit mode by default.
