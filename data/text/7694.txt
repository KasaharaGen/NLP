Q: Will it damage my iPad if I use an iPhone charger to charge it? I have the opposite issue of this question: Is it OK to charge my iPhone with my iPad charger?
I want to use my iPhone charger (plugged directly into main electricity) to charge my iPad. I've noticed that the charger gets quite warm when charging the iPad (not iPhone).
Is it unsafe to charge the iPad via the iPhone 5W charger?

A: No 
I mix and match my chargers often, the only disadvantage is that the iPhone charger charges slower according to a lot of sources, but I have yet to experience it. I still have an iPhone 3G charger I use as a spare at work to charge my iPad on occasion.
Interestingly I have never noticed my chargers getting hot either, but will admit I have never actively looked.
Looking at the Charging Tips here the reason for the slower charge is that the iPhone charger is 5W compared to 10W for the iPad, based on wattage alone, I can't see how you would damage the iPad, I would suspect using a higher wattage might however.

A: Any charger circuit has inner impedence,the wattage bigger,the inner impedence
Will be smaller,the voltage drop while charging also smaller,the result is a charging time litter bit longer.On other side,the inner impedence contain resistance,it cause the charger warm ( temperature rise),so if you use the 5w
Charger to charge an iPad,you can feel the adapter warmer than used on iPhone
. But if the temerature keep stable,it is safety.
