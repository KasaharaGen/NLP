Q: How to "block" calls? How do we "block" calls such that no one is able to call through?
For example, I would not like anyone to call me for the next 60 minutes, but I do not wish to turn off the phone.
What's the best solution?

A: You have four options.


*

*Turn on Do Not Disturb and lock the screen (or configure it to block all calls whether the screen is locked or not on iOS 7)

*Place the phone in AirPlane mode - this disables the cellular data, SMS and cellular calls as well as WiFi. You can turn on WiFi while in AirPlane mode to access data and still be undisturbed.

*Use your carrier to start call forwarding. It will send your calls to another number (google voice is a nice place to send them if you don't have another appropriate line). On AT&T, you dial the following to start forwarding, call: **21*1234567890# - assuming your other number is (123)456-7890. To stop the forwarding, call #21#

*Remove the sim. If you have another sim (same carrier or unlocked phone) that would in effect turn off your primary phone service without deactivating the phone. 


A: Ask you cellular carrier how to forward calls.  Then forward the calls to some other number (your office, an answering service, some phone that your cousin never picks up, etc.)
