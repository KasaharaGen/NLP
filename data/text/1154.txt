Q: Magic Mouse / Wireless keyboard not fully functional after Archive & Install I'm having multiple issues with my 2008-model MacBook Pro.  I took it to the Genius Bar and they suggested an Archive & Install, which I did.  But now I have a new issue.
I have the wireless/bluetooth Apple Magic Mouse and Wireless Keyboard.  Since the Archive & Install, neither is working properly.  The mouse tracks and clicks, but the "touchpad" features like scrolling and swiping don't register at all.  Also, the function key on the wireless keyboard doesn't seem to do anything.
If I go to the System Preferences and select Mouse, then "setup Bluetooth Mouse" I get a "Searching..." and a spinning wheel forever.  The mouse is paired but I can't configure the Magic features.
Similarly for Keyboard.  It's paired, and I've clicked "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" so that if I want to use the keyboard to change the volume or something I should be able to use the combination Fn-F11.  But both F11 and Fn-F11 do an Exposé thing.  If I click "Set up Bluetooth Keyboard..." I also get "Searching..." and the eternally spinning wheel.
If I go to the Keyboard Viewer I see a keyboard layout that looks like the wireless one, but as soon as I press a key the Keyboard Viewer changes to a layout that looks more like the extended keyboard.  Pressing Fn changes the keycaps on the ⌫ key to ⌦ , and the arrow keys change, too, but actually pressing these key combinations doesn't do what it says it will do: Fn-⌫ and ⌫ are doing the same thing.
Casting the "put to sleep/wake up" and "restart" spells don't seem to have any effect.  Any clues? 

A: The "software update" spell solved it.  I had a number of updates come down last night and everything seems to work now.
