Q: The bottom of my iPhone won't accept touches. Can I fix that? My iPhone (1st Gen) is no longer able to recognize when I touch it at the very bottom of the screen.  The only way this effects me is when I have the keyboard up I cant hit the 123, spacebar, or send.
Is there some way I can fix this?  I've tried restoring but that didn't do the trick.  Is this something that I can take in and have fixed? 

A: Turns the phone upside down and hope that the app you are using supports that orientation :)

A: Off to the Genius Bar with you. Though I'm willing to bet they'll probably just recommend you get a new phone.

A: They might do 1G here. Worked great when I busted my 3GS screen.
