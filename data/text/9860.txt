Q: iPad/iPad2 - PDF page rendering speed I would like to know how long (in milliseconds) does it take for the iPad/iPad2 to render a PDF page. Every page and every PDF are different, of course. I am interested in average figures if you have any or can measure it, for any PDF's that are technical books.
