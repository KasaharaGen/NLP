Q: Streaming music from dropbox to iPad Is there really no way to stream music from dropbox to iPad and play MORE THAN ONE song at once and without giving third parties (Boxytunes etc) my dropbox password?

A: Mc Loud uses oAuth authentication. This means that your password is not seen by the App, but entered on an internet page of Dropbox. Mc Loud only gets an anonymous token from Dropbox that you can revoke at any time in your Dropbox account.
