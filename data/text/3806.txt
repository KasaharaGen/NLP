Q: All pages in Google Chrome are rendered with a very thin, bad looking serif font In every later release of Google Chrome (including the just released version 11), all pages are rendered with a very thin, jaggy serif font.
This is how it looks in Chrome 11:

And here is Safari 5.0.5:

The picture might be too small to really show how bad the serif font is, but on-screen it's horrible.
There's no difference if I try to edit the font settings in Chrome. It's always the same font. I've also — of course — tried to remove and re-install Chrome, multiple times. Have tried to remove everything Chrome-related from $HOME/Library (Application Support, Caches etc). No change in behavior.
Here is an example of my font settings, but as I said, the font is always the same — on all pages — regardless of what I set in the font settings. I can set it to Helvetica and it's still a jaggy, horrible, small serif:

So, what do I do? Suggestions?

A: Before you go blocking fonts and so on, first check this page:

How you get rendered the fonts? On my chrome - without any problems, the chrome CAN render different fonts.
You can try these commands from the Terminal.app
sudo atsutil databases -remove
sudo atsutil server -shutdown
sudo atsutil server -ping

the above will remove your font cache. Work only in snow leopard!

A: Chrome is ignoring the website font rules and displaying everything in Times New Roman.
Other people have encountered this same issue.  You can see the discussion in the Chrome Help forums here:

Here is the suggested fix:

I use FontExplorerX Pro. I setup a rule for font requests to deny any request from Chrome.
Then I downloaded Onyx and ran the script to clean all font caches. Restarted and now things are normal.

If this works for you, please mark JTWilcox's answer as helpful in the Chrome forums.

A: Just increase minimum font size in prefs
