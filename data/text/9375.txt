Q: Verify a CD/DVD from ISO Is there a tool (preferably free) in OS X that will allow me to verify that an ISO was written to a CD or DVD correctly? I want a tool that can do that without going through the burn first.
If there's a tool that can be used from the command line, that's fine too.

A: You have two choices that I can see if you don't want to re-burn and re-verify.


*

*Mount the ISO and the DVD and do a recursive diff of the two file systems. For example, if the DVD is /Volumes/DVD and the ISO is /Volumes/ISO then:
diff --recursive /Volumes/DVD /Volumes/ISO

*Compare the MD5 sums of all the data on the two images. So:
md5 original.iso
dd if=/dev/disk1 bs=2048 count=169383 | md5
I'd take option #2 over #1 personally, though both are less than great ways to do a comparison.
You could also try exploiting rsync to do the comparison instead of using diff. If you ran rsync with the --checksum, --recursive and --dry-run options what you'd get back is a list of transfers that rsync thinks it needs to make to make the two file trees look the same.
