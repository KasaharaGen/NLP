Q: MBAir wifi hardware not installed I posted this question over at the Apple Support forums a couple days ago, but I haven't gotten an answer yet so I'll also post it here.
Ever since I bought my 11' mid-2011 MBA I have issues with wifi. When the computer awakens from sleep, wifi gets turned off and can't be activated again. If I reboot, the wifi icon is greyed out and says "Wifi hardware not installed". The only way to fix it is by turning off and then powering on the MBA.
I've tried various fixes to no avail. I took a screen capture of the messages and also saved system reports of the three stages in this issue: wifi ok, wifi can't be activated and wifi not installed.
Can anyone help me?

Thanks.

A: I have experienced the same problem on the same hardware, my solution (which has ben working OK for 3 days now) was to replace the DNS server settings with Primary, Secondary & Tertiary number strings determined by running an app called namebench.
