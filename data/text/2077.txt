Q: How to disable ._ AppleDouble files for SMB? I have a small problem. I don't want that our Macs here create the ._ files to the network drive. For example when you copy an image over the finder to the SMB storage.
Is there a way to disable this function in Finder? 
The .DS_Store file is already disabled, but not files such as ._pic1.jpg .
We activated veto files in samba to prevent creation of ._ files, there arose an error – not enough permissions on the drive.
Thank to all ;)

A: Don't know of a way within Finder, but Blue Harvest (paid application) offers this functionality: http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest4/

A: Finder
Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems. 
Please, you should not attempt to prevent Finder from creating ._ (dot underscore) files during copy or move routines. 
File system
If you prevent creation at the file system level – as you did with your configuration of Samba – you make that file system partially incompatible with at least: 


*

*Apple Finder

*Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011.


(For any use case that involves Office 2011 saving to a file system, you must allow ._ on that file system … and so on.)

For more detail please see my answer to a more recent question, Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?:

*Purposes of .DS_Store and ._ files
