Q: Using the ALT key in Windows with Parallels I need Windows for my development environment on my Mac. I use Alt-U and Alt-S a lot in this software. I can't do this on my Mac. Is there a way to send the Alt key presses to the virtual machine? 
Alt-U shows the Accessibility Utility Manager. Pressing Alt-S just types an "s". At work on Windows XP, neither of these behaviors happen.

A: I was able to get the desired effect by holding down the ctrl+alt keys, then releasing just the ctrl key to use the alt function.
Hurrah! No editing keyboard preferences required. Hope this helps someone else too.

A: For me the solution is to use the right Alt not the left Alt on the keyboard. For unknown reasons that does the trick.

A: Disable the option for switching alt and cmd. The mapping should be: alt=option, cmd=windows.

A: Go in to preferences on Parallels and add mappings individually for each letter combo of alt and a letter. alta maps to alta, altb maps to altb etc for all key combos that involve alt.  Time consuming but it appears to work so far.

A: You should be able to use the option key - I just used it on the Windows 8 Dev Preview as well as Windows 7 using VMWare Fusion 4. See picture below for detail of option key:


A: Can you use the "Optimize modifier keys for games" option; does it help you?

(I want to use the option, but don't see it in my configuration panels...)
Oh, it's moved to the Advanced pane.

A: I just set one map: option to Alt, and it works.
