Q: Configuring SSL with Apache under Lion Following on from my previous question (which I answered myself),
Configuring OS X 10.7 Lion Server to serve Rails Apps via Apache
...I'm now looking to set up SSL.
Again, I have the config working fine under Snow Leopard, but I want to set this up on a new i7 Mac Mini, so running Snow Leopard isn't an option.
I'm using the named virtual host kludge described in the link answer above, but I've been unable to get SSL working.
The Snow Leopard config I'm basing my Lion config is included below.
Tips on configuring the equivalent under Lion would be very much appreciated. Thanks.
<VirtualHost 10.0.1.1:80>
  ServerName bonk.example.com

  Redirect / https://bonk.example.com/

</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 10.0.1.1:443>
    ServerName bonk.example.com
    DocumentRoot "/Rails/deployed/bonk/current/public"
    RackEnv example_production
    RailsEnv example_production
    <Directory "/Rails/deployed/bonk/current/public">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
      Options FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>

A: Generate a host key
First, make a home for the new SSL files. I use /etc/apache2/ssl.  Open up a terminal window, cd to the new directory and issue the following command to create a host key file.
sudo ssh-keygen -f host.key

Generate a certificate request file
This command create a certificate request file. A certificate request file contains information about your organization that will be used in the SSL certificate.
sudo openssl req -new -key host.key -out request.csr

Create the SSL certificate
Create a self signed SSL certificate using the request file.
sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey host.key -out server.crt

Configure Apache
Create a backup of /etc/apache2/httpd.conf. 
Append the contents of /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.
In /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, make sure the loading of SSL is enabled (remove the #)
LoadModule ssl_module libexec/apache2/mod_ssl.so

Also, edit SSL section to use the new certificate.
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/host.key

Check the config and restart Apache to try the new certificate.
sudo apachectl configtest
sudo apachectl restart

Thanks to the House of Ding and Matt Langtree for providing much of this solution.

A: The problem with above is that a password or pass phrase is required from apache which it cannot get. Therefore apache will not run or startup! 
What's needed is to create a "no password" host key with this command:
openssl rsa -in host.key -out host.nopass.key

...and direct apache's ssl key to the host.nopass.key that it generates.
When I did this, my Lion Apache runs successfully.
