Q: Is it possible to (legally) download the latest iPod firmware without owning the actual device? I think the question says it all, but: I'm looking for a way to legally download the most current iPod firmware for free, without owning an iPod. Is there a way to do so?

A: Search for "iOS {your desired version} direct download" and you'll find links. Here's one for 4.3.4:
