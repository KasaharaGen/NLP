Q: Why don't I have a camera on my iPod touch? Why do a couple of my friends have a camera on their iPod touch and I don't?

A: Only the 4th generation iPod Touch has cameras, that is the iPod Touch that was introduced back in September. The iPod Touch you have is either a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation, which means it doesn't have the camera.

A: As far as I know, only the 4th gen iPod touch has a camera. Yours is probably older.
As you can see from the specifications published on Apple's site, there are no mention of a camera for the third gen iPod touch, while the fourth gen has detailed information about it.
