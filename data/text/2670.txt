Q: MacBook freezing? While I was working with my (unibody, 10.5) MacBook, suddenly the display was covered by a grey shade and a message - in four languages - appeared, ordering me to restart the computer, and of course nothing else was working.
While I know that I should describe in detail all programs running etc., does anybody have an idea about what kind of problem could possibly have caused this? I don't believe it ever happened in almost three years with the same computer.

A: This is called a Kernel Panic, and it probably wasn't your fault. They usually aren't a huge deal. 
This Apple doc has information about what happened, and directions about what could have caused it and how to fix it.
In says about the problem:

This message indicates that an error
  occurred in the core of the operating
  system, which is referred to as a
  “kernel panic.”
A kernel panic can be caused by
  damaged or incompatible software or,
  in rare cases, by damaged or
  incompatible hardware. The most likely
  cause of the problem is that a system
  file or folder has been moved,
  replaced, or damaged.

See the To Solve This Problem section for directions about recovery.
