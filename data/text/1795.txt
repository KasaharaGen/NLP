Q: Temporarily disabling the startup sound Is it possible to disable the startup sound on an iMac G5, or at least decrease its volume? 
The obvious way to do this would be to put a script in the shutdown folder (OS X 10.4.11) that mutes the sound, then put one in the startup folder that reverses it. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find a "mute" script. 
Edit: To clarify, how can you set the system to mute with a script? 

A: There is a 3rd party StartupSound.PrefPane for this.

A: UPDATE: You're right. I am wrong. All you need is a script, and this is all you need to do:
set volume 0 
-- 0 = mute, 7 = full volume


A: If you want to disable it temporarily (as the title suggests) itÂ´s easiest to hold down the "mute" key (on the upper right of your keyboard) during the initial seconds of booting.
