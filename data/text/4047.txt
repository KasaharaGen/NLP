Q: How do I determine which app is trying to invoke Google Chrome? For some reason, Google Chrome was randomly starting up on my system. I uninstalled it, and now I occasionally get the "Choose Application" dialog, which asks "Where is Google Chrome.app?"
How can I determine which application on my machine is trying to invoke Google Chrome?
(Note that I have "Google Chrome Canary" installed, and it is set as my default web browser).  

A: Two places come to mind immediately.


*

*Start up Safari and make sure Google Chrome isn't the default browser.

*Clean up your launch services database.


Since you have already done #1 - redoing it won't likely matter but your safari pref file storing this setting could be corrupt.
Item 2 needs more explanation - Use Finder to right click on a text or html file - if you still see Chrome in the Open With... dialog you might want to manually rebuild the launch services database. 

A: man iosnoop

man execsnoop

man opensnoop 

Also possible to get a hint of what's going on running
launchctl bslist -j

as root, which will show you launchd jobs, -j tells you which job started it, 
and 
launchctl bstree

Which shows the jobs running, and under which domain they are running under.
