Q: Is it possible Select and Autocopy in Mac I would like autocopy for every text that I select to avoid to do several CMD+C.
Is there any way or application to do this?

A: I don’t know of any software that does that at a system level and apparently, neither do these guys at SuperUser. ;)
The reason why there’s no extension that does this for Safari yet is because the API for Extensions on Safari doesn’t support Clipboard mechanism at this time.

A: You can get this for Terminal by using iTerm instead
