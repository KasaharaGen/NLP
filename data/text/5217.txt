Q: Mac Book Pro - 5 400 tr/min or 7 200 tr/min? I'm buying a mac book pro (this one: http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC723LL/A?mco=MjEyOTY4OTQ).
My doubt is: 


*

*5400 tr/min 750Gb or

*7200 tr/min 500Gb ?


I would appreciate the extra space but I'm afraid of the 5400 be really really slower than 7200.
What do you think?

A: If you're not hammering the hard drive all the time, say by doing HD video work, then you're not going to notice. In that case, the 5400 might be better because it is larger, takes less power and is less likely to fail.
