Q: Why don’t events created in iCal show up in my iCloud calendar? Yesterday I installed Mac OS X 10.7.2, iOS5, and set up my iCloud.com account. I entered my iCloud details in System Preferences in Mac OS X, and in Settings on iOS. In both places, I set calendar syncing to “On”
However, I just created a test event in iCal, and it didn’t sync to iCloud.com or iOS. Events created on iOS sync to iCloud and iCal just fine.
What’s going on?

A: It turns out I had to:


*

*Add my iCloud account to iCal, in iCal > Preferences > Accounts.

*Set my default calendar to one of my iCloud calendars, in iCal > Preferences > General.
See e.g.

It seems a bit strange that I had to do this manually — you’d think just turning on Calendar syncing in the iCloud preference pane would do it.

A: I changed my "Refresh" settings in iCal preferences from "push" to "every five minutes." For some reason, this got things moving again and started syncing.
