Q: How long does it take for Apple's AA battery charger to recharge? I'm talking about the charger that comes with their new Bluetooth trackpad and keyboard.
If I put 2 empty batteries in it now, how long till they're full?

A: Apple has said that it may take up to five hours to charge the batteries.

A: Usually 4 to 5 hours for me to recharge the 2 AA batteries.  Basically I recharge the batteries when its power is lower than 10%.

A: Mine usually seems to take about 3 hours for completely drained batteries.
