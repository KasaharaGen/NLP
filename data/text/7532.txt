Q: How do I force homebrew to update installed software? I have pianobar installed and I'm trying to update it using brew update pianobar. I also tried brew update pianobar --force but that didn't have any effect. It says that I have local changes, but I'm not sure how to tell it to just overwrite these.

A: As @Felix said, use upgrade not update.
If the problem comes from your dirty git tree and you just want to forget about your modifications, type git reset --hard HEAD before upgrading.

A: I don't know why this happens with Homebrew when you don't do anything to mess with it, but here's how I fixed it:


*

*Change to your Homebrew cellar directory cd `brew --cellar`

*Reset git repository git reset --hard HEAD

*Upgrade pianobar, at last! brew upgrade pianobar
FYI, brew update will update Homebrew to the latest version, so you may want to do that before step 3.

A: This is a general answer, not specific to your pianobar problem.
To update installed software, first update brew: brew update
and then upgrade the installed software: brew upgrade
To prevent some software from being upgraded, do brew pin YOUR-PACKAGE-HERE
