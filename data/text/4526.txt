Q: installing python2.4 on osx10.6? I prefer installing stuff from their source and dont use package managers generally. Has anyone here tried building python2.4 from source here? If so, had any luck with the same? 

A: Probably you have some troubles building it from a sources. My 0.02$:

*check here https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/python24
In the files subdir you can see the needed patches to sources, but especially the patches needed to the Makefile and configure, for the successful build. Use the above as a learning material for your own build process.
Ps: only wondering, what is wrong with macports.org? Why does not use it directly? All things are builded/compiled on your machine from the sources and you can always check the patches and so on... (so, no binary installs).
