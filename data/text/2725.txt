Q: Snap feature for Mac? Coming from Windows I have gotten extremely used to the Windows Snap feature, which resizes a window when it's dragged to the screen edges.
However, it's not built into OS X. Are there any 3rd party utilities that add this functionality?

A: Spectacle was mentioned in a question that was marked as duplicate of this one, but has not yet appeared here. It is also open source:


*

*Spectacle at Github
Also, OS X El Capitan (OS X 10.11) will have a side-to-side snap feature when it is released later in 2015 using Mission Control.

A: This functionality is now built into Mac OS. Hold down the green resize button, and you then get an overlay on both sides of the screen that show which side you will be snapping to.

A: You may also be looking for SizeUp (13$). That emulates the Windows Snap features better, I think.

A: Your looking for HyperDock  ($9.95)

HyperDock brings advanced window management features to Mac OS:
   - Move & resize windows just by holding down keys and moving your mouse.
   - Automatically resize windows when dragging to screen edges (Window Snapping).


A: I use bettertouchtool which includes this feature for free
this also alows you to create custom gestures for your trackpad / magic mouse / magic trackpad

A: For window arranging:


*

*SizeUp  $13

*Divvy  $14

*Breeze  $8

*ShiftIt  Free

*Mercury Mover  $20

*Optimal Layout  $14

*Cinch  $7 

*Moom  $10


A: I've discovered another utility (released via the Mac App Store just today!) that seems to provide the exact functionality as Windows Snap. It's called Moom ($5), and it adds an iOS-style popover to the green Maximize button in Mac windows. The popover has buttons that let you do the following:


*

*Restore original position

*Zoom to full screen

*Move to left, zoom to half width

*Move to right, zoom to half width

*Move to top, zoom to half height

*Move to bottom, zoom to half height


You can use the mouse or keyboard to invoke any of this window moving and zooming, and you get additional functionality if you use the keyboard. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like just the ticket.

A: You are looking for Cinch

Cinch gives you simple, mouse-driven window management by defining the left, right, and top edges of your screen as 'hot zones'. Drag a window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the window to have it cinch into place.


A: Cinch ($7) works a lot like Aero Snap.
Most of the time it's more convenient to use keyboard shortcuts though. For that I'd recommend ShiftIt. It's free, extremely simple and also has an action for Windows-style maximize.
For those possibly looking for snapping windows to screen elements: Zooom/2.

A: Magnet, available on the Mac App Store for $7.99 by CrowdCaf√© is pretty good

A: Since Spectacle from the top answer is no longer actively maintained, i would recommend Rectangle as the closest replacement for the Snap feature from Windows.
By default you could snap windows to the sides, top/button or in the edges. There are also customizable shortcuts for doing so.
And the best part: It is free :)
