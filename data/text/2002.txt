Q: Why does my keyboard switch language in most input fields on the web? I'm basically using US keyboard as my default, but I also have enabled Czech (QWERTY), which has quite different layout for when I need those special characters.
The problem is, that in the past few days whenever I put focus in a password field in Google Chrome, it automatically switches from the US to Czech and I can't switch back, as it is grayed out.

But once I click out of the password field, I can change it back without any problems. What could possibly cause this? I'm using OS X 10.6.6 on Macbook Pro if that's of any relevance.

A: I've had weird input-switching behavior before when the keyboard shortcut to switch input sources was the same as something else I was using, like Quicksilver.  Try disabling or changing the relevant shortcuts in System Preferences (under Keyboard & Text Input).
UPDATE: Detailed instructions:


*

*Open System Preferences

*Open the Keyboard preference (under Hardware)

*Select Keyboard and Text on the left

*Find "Select the previous input source" in the box on the right and uncheck it.  Its shortcut was probably set to Command-Space.


A: I could solve the issue by performing the following steps in Chrome:


*

*disabling all chrome extensions

*disable chrome extension developer mode

*quit and restart chrome

*enabling the previous settings again


A: I'm having the same problem. I ended up just disabling the other two layouts and the problem stopped. Certainly frustrating, when you can't figure out why you're typing gibberish.
