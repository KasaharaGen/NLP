Q: iPhone Visual VoiceMail in Israel I brought my unlocked iPhone 4S to Israel and got a local SIM card. The voicemail button is calling the voicemail instead of showing me the visual voicemail.
I asked my provider about it (Cellcom) and they had no idea what I was talking about. They didn't even know Visual Voicemail existed.
Is there a way to enable it?

A: Nope.
Visual Voicemail needs to be activated by the service provider as it uses their services. It requires some work on their side, so I would imagine they need a big group of people wanting it.
Out of interest, this Wikipedia article briefly covers the topic. There is no open standard for this feature, so it hasn't been deployed on a lot of networks due to the service provider having to provide the required interfaces.

A: Hi if you go to this page on the Apple website you will find a list of carriers that support Visual Voicemail. 
Not all carriers have Visual Voicemail. Although it is shown as a main feature of iPhone
