Q: Is it safe to upgrade Bash via Homebrew? I'm new to OS X. I'm running OS X Lion on a MacBook Pro. Is it safe to upgrade the bash shell using Homebrew:
$ brew install bash

If safe, how do I make it the default instance of the shell I run through Terminal?
Thanks!

A: I could be wrong here, but as far as I know brew would install it's own instance of bash, since brew works under /usr/local/bin while the system defaults works under /bin (and /usr/bin).
About Terminal, you can make shells open with your own, custom command. Go to Preferences > Startup and select Shells open with: Command (complete path). Simply type the path to your new bash and vuala!
Hope it helps!
BTW: Backup! Best advice in this situations!

A: Well before you do anything, back up your current file (of course, but always deserves to be said)
sudo cp /bin/bash /bin/bash.3.2.bk

Then create a symlink to the bash executable that Homebrew downloaded. I think it will be in /usr/local/Cellar, like so
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.10/bin/bash /bin/bash

Now /bin/bash points to the file in your usr/local directory

A: Binaries in /{,usr/}{,s}bin/ should not usually be replaced with other files. Other programs expect them to be the versions that came with OS X, and they are replaced by OS upgrades.
After running brew install bash, you can change the default shell safely by:


*

*Adding /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells

*Running chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash.


Settings in Terminal or iTerm 2 don't normally have to be changed. Both of them default to opening new windows with a login shell of the default shell.
The default shell can also be changed from System Preferences or with dscl, but all three options just modify /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/$USER.plist.

A: I think it is safe if you just launch
brew install bash

and then add it as your default shell
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

since you are only modifying your current user. However, I noticed that my default ~/.profile is
if [ "/bin/bash" == $BASH ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi

so it needs to be updated. I changed it to
if [ "bash" == $(basename $BASH) ]; then
        source ~/.bashrc
fi
