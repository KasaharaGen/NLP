Q: DNS gone after wakeup I'm having problems with the DNS resolution after a wakeup from sleep.
The system I'm running is Mac OS X Lion 10.7, and I am properly connected to my Wifi.
When I issue a ping google.com in the Terminal, it just works. But going through any browser or Application that requires internet access, they all can't resolve the hostname.
I can solve this issue by going to System Preferences > Network Settings and I deactive/activate my Wifi. After that everything works again.
Where else can I look into to solve this permanently?
