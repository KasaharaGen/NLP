Q: iPhone: WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular network not working I have iPhone 3GS and suddenly it's gone away. I mean WiFi, bluetooth is not working, and I can't make any calls.
Here's a screenshot:

Any help will be appreciated!

A: Wow. Seems like the modem/baseband part is gone wrong. Try rebooting the phone. If still not working - backup your information (from iTunes) and try a restore to factory settings (I'm assuming a factory unlocked phone, no JB). If this doesn't help - probably it's a hardware failure.
About the IMEI blockage - no, it's not the case.
