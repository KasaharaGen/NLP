Q: Can I play audio out to both USB and Bluetooth on a MacPro simultaneously? I'm running Snow Leopard on a Mac Pro- audio preferences seem to limit audio output to only one port at a time. Is there a way around this? Also the Bluetooth output from the Mac is really weak, is there any way to increase it or make it more effective?

A: Concerning the audio devides: try this and if it fails try this.

A: You can use JackOSX it's a powerful and easy app from unix world that allow you to dispatch any input/output into any input/output
