Q: Setting time format preference in unix (Mac-Terminal) I'm learning to work in unix using Terminal on a Mac and I'd like to set the default listing for the timestamp to display in 12 hour time, using AM and PM, instead of 24 hour time (ie: 1:00 PM, not 13:00). I'm somewhat familiar with setting preferences, so to speak, using the ~/.bashrc file, where I've set a couple of aliases, including one with the options for my preferred ls display. I've looked at the man pages and elsewhere online, but I haven't had any luck finding what I'm looking for time-wise though. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  

A: Using GNU ls, on Linux, there is a --time-style flag you can use to specify one of a few pre-defined time types, or specifying a completely custom +FORMAT style like the date command accepts. However, BSD ls, which Apple ships, does not support this flag.
I've seen similar discrepancies in commands like date and tar as well, all rooted in the differences between the GNU and BSD variants.

A: The Mac OS terminal uses a bash shell. The prompt is controlled by the PS1 environment variable described more here. Try this for example.
export PS1='\t$ '

It will give you a prompt looking something like this
19:40:14$ 


A: man date
Check out the "+format" option.  You could create a shell alias to display the date using a custom format.
If you're referring to the time format used by 'ls', I don't believe there is any way to change that.

A: to get 12:00 AM/PM use
  export PS='\@'

I hope this helps.
