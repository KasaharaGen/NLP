Q: How to install plug-in in Gimp on OS X? I've got the Gimp for Mac OS X installed and working in my installation of Mac OS X 10.6.4. A very important tool I need is the David's Batch Processor plugin ( http://members.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp.html ) for batch auto-adjusting contrast/brightness/colour for my images.
There are no Mac specific instructions provided on the software's website saying how to install the python-based plugin. Can anyone please teach me how to install plugins for Gimp in Mac OS X?

A: There are OS X instructions in the GIMP documentation and they suggest installing GIMP from fink or macports. Do this and you can follow the Linux/Unix instructions for plugin installation. Otherwise, the documentation states "good luck" if you install it some other way.
However, searching http://gimper.net suggests that, for a Python plugin, you should put it in: [your home]/Library/Applications Support/Gimp/plug-ins (create directory if necessary).

A: You'll find the appropriate folders at /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Gimp/. There go in the scripts folder
and the presets go in the gimpressionist folder
I found these locations by looking at the GIMP preferences, and clicking on Scripts. The locations cited above were listed there.

A: I've managed to get DBP installed on my Mac (version 10.6.8). I've made the compiled plugin available on my blog, since compiling Gimp from MacPorts took an overnight compilation session, and is way too much hassle for folks who just want to plug-n-play.
So... anyone is welcome to grab my binary as they wish. If it's useful, please comment, and if it doesn't work, please comment; in either case if you can state versions of OS X and Gimp, that will hopefully help other users trying to avoid compiling it themselves!
