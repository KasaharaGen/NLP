Q: How to disable to login screen shortcut (Cmd+Alt+L) I'm trying to find where this shortcut is being configured under Snow Leopard but I simply can not. Any help would be appreciated!

A: Not sure what you're trying to do, but Safari uses CMD+Alt+L for the downloads window.
Also, I used to use LockMyScreen (which doesn't work in Snow Leopard anymore), and it's shortcut is showing in my Mac as CMD+Alt+L.
I went to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, then looked in Application Shortcuts.
