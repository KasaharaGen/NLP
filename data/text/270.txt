Q: What is a good Apple podcast to listen to on a daily basis? If I have time to listen to just one podcast a day or every other day about Apple stuff, which one should I listen to?  I know there's a lot of different specialized Apple podcasts out there (i.e. Mac downloads, iOS apps, Apple news, etc.), but can anyone recommend a general podcast which has elements of all of these?  I'd also be interested in the best podcasts in certain specialized areas, but mostly I'm looking for one that I can listen to consistently and find out most of what is going on in the Apple world.

A: MacBreak Weekly seems to fit the bill except it's, er, weekly. I don't know of any daily podcasts.

A: Mac OS Ken
I really like the podcast Mac OS Ken. From the description on iTunes...

This is daily Apple news. Monday
through Friday, Ken Ray brings
commute-sized tech news to the
podsphere. If it's Apple news,
Apple-related news, or news related to
Apple-related news, you'll hear about
it here. News you'll like... this is
Mac OS Ken.

It is free five times per week with a 'Day 6' show available to paid subscribers. The podcast is very well-done, informative and entertaining with a bit of humor.
On iTunes: Mac OS Ken
Web site: Mac OS Ken

A: Hypercritical from 5by5 is excellent, John Siracua is a great analyst

A: These aren't released daily, but I also like the MacCast, and MacGeekGab.
I still listen to MacBreak Weekly, but I listen more for Andy Ihnatko than Leo Laporte.  Leo is a radio and TV guy who talks for a living. Andy studies technology and is an amazing writer.
EDIT: As a newbie to this forum, I can't post more than one hyperlink yet (Even though I belong to several other StackExchange sites), but the podcasts are all available through iTunes. I'll leave the link to Andy's blog.

A: 
I'm not sure about the "daily" but TED talks are very good. They have multiple "streams" for audio, video, and high definition video.
