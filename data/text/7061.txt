Q: Limit Spotlight to mail The thing is I hate Spotlight like every software burning my cpu for no reason when I am working and I could put my cpu to better use BUT it is required to search in mail bodies with Mail so I still keep it...
What I really want to do is stop Spotlight to index anything but my emails, is there a way to do that ?
I already added the biggest folders to the ignore list but it does not seems to be enough since as I am writing this mds is happily using between 10% and 30% of my cpu :/

A: If mds is continually using that much CPU then something else is wrong, that's not usual behaviour. Once the index is created, it's incrementally updated and shouldn't be using that much CPU at all.
However, you could try telling Spotlight only to display Mail Messages in searches. You'll find that option in System Preferences in the Spotlight section. (edit) This doesn't actually stop Spotlight indexing those items, but it wont display them in results.

I think you have a more fundamental problem here with Spotlight that should be resolved. Try deleting and recreating the index with the following command:
sudo mdutil -i on -Evsa
