Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for inserting MathType equations in Pages? I have more and more thoughts about taking my class notes on my computer, and Pages '09 would seem like a good candidate for that task. However, being that I have a lot of technical classes, I find myself needing to insert MathType equations very often.
Is there a keyboard shortcut to insert such an equation? If not, can I somehow make one?

A: Update for 2019: The newer versions of Pages actually recently added equation support! Just go to Insert > Equation... or hit ⌥⌘E.
It uses LaTeX or MathML, but if you want to use MathType there's apparently a button for that in the resulting dialog, or you can set it to be your default. (I don't have MathType, so I can't test this.)
The Apple Support page has more information.

A: FastScripts is my choice to easily make key shortcuts for accessing menu items - much nicer, more flexible and far more powerful than the keyboard preference pane. Also, LaunchBar works wonders for fast switching apps / activating services and learns your preferred key shortcuts on the go rather than having to program them in beforehand (but you can do that too if you like).
