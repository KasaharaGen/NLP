Q: How to use the mysql I just installed? I have installed mysql in Mac OS X 10.6.6. However I don't know how to get to the mysql prompt.  
Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ pwd  
/usr/local/mysql/bin
Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$ mysql  
-bash: mysql: command not found  
Sarbbottam-Bandyopadhyays-MacBook-Pro:bin sarbbottam$  

Any thoughts?

A: An alternative for newbies (and webdevelopers) is MAMP and phpMyAdmin (that comes bundled with MAMP). Maybe worth a thought.

A: If you already are in the /usr/local/mysql/bin directory, just launch:
./mysql

You should consider adding a symbolic link to /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql to the /usr/bin directory.
