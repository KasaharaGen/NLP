Q: MacBook Pro screen dimming problems after EFI 2.3 update I recently updated my MacBook Pro to the latest firmware: EFI 2.3. Since then when my screen dims from idleness (while plugged in), it takes at least 5-10 seconds to come back on after I touch the trackpad, keyboard, or mouse. Everything worked fine before the EFI update.
Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, are there any solutions?

A: This is what I did and it worked for me:

1.Shut down the computer.
2.Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if >its not already connected.
3.On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.
4.Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.
5.Press the power button to turn on the computer. 
Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.
