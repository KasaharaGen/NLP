Q: iPhone E-Mail Cache This is a general iPhone usability question. I wanted to know if we can clear contact cache in email of iPhone mail account?

A: This isn't possible right now, but many people have filed a radar report to request an option to reset this cache in the Settings app (in the same view where it's possible to reset your network settings, etc..).
The only way would be to clear the entire contents of your iPhone and don't restore from any backup.
