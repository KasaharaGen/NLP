Q: Is there a presentation mode on mac? When watching a video, or making a presentation, is there an option or a tool to disable all screensaving, energy savings and all? Regardless of if the power is plugged, I'd like to keep the screen fully on.
I know I can manually adjust the settings everytime. But is there a "presentation" mode, in addition to "battery" and "power adapter" modes?
Or a tool to achieve this?
Thanks

A: The best 3rd-party based solution for you is to use Caffeine.

About Caffeine:   A tiny program that
  puts an icon in the right side of your
  menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac
  from automatically going to sleep,
  dimming the screen or starting screen
  savers. Click it again to go back.
  Hold down the Command key while
  clicking to show the menu.


A: Nothing built-in to the OS, but MarcoPolo can be used to do what you want.
