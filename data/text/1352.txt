Q: Where's iOS 4.2 image file? On Apple Developers portal, under downloads I get this:

Where are the iPhone 3G / 4 / iPad versions of the OS?
As I had beta 2 on my iPad (I'm have a iOS developer account), and I want to update to the new one, iTunes says iPad has version 4.2 (witch is right, 4.2b) and mentions, that there is no newer version.

A: got it here

weird that is not available in the Portal itself :(

A: 4.2.1 is the newest version, and it's no longer in beta. So that means you get it through iTunes, by syncing your device and clicking the "Check for Update" button. There won't be images in the Developer Portal until Apple decides to put the next version of iOS (4.3?) into beta.

A: An iOS image file (also called IPSW short for iPhone Software file) for publicly released version of iOS can be obtained unofficially from IPSW.
The OS images are signed and verified with Apple servers when attempting a restore via iTunes. Do note that Apple stops signing older releases sometime (usually a couple weeks) after releasing a new iOS update. Hence, this method can be used to restore an iOS device to latest public release of iOS in cases as the one discussed in the question.
