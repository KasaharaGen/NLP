Q: Use multiple speakers to play 2 ch audio My macbook pro has 2 built in speakers and a line-out for audio.
Additionally, I have it connected to my cinema display wich also has 2 speakers.
I want to know how to combine them to use all of them to play my musics so it does't just come from a single output.

A: Audio MIDI Setup to the rescue!
Open Audio MIDI Setup which is located in Applications > Utilities.
Click the + icon in the bottom-left hand side and choose Create Multi-Output Device.

When the multi-output device is selected, click the Built-In Output, and the Cinema Display's output audio devices.
After this is done, open System Preferences and click the Sound category. Under the Output tab, choose the Multi-Output device.
Any applications that were open when you started this process may have to be restarted in order to pick up the change in default sound devices. Some do, some don't.
I do believe that should do it.

A: I'm not sure but you can try JackAudio. It's powerful multi-sources input/output mixer.
