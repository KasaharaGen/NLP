Q: Is there a shortcut to expand all folders in Finder's list view? I have my Finder window set up to display in "list" view so that it shows all folders with triangles on the left to click to expand. I have a number of levels of nested folders. Is there any way (keyboard shortcut, menu item, etc.) to expand all, so I don't have to click through each level to see the files contained?

A: To expand one single level folder
Command Right arrow
To expand all levels of subfolders under the selected folder.
Command Option Right arrow
OR
Option and click the triangle in folder view in Finder

A: Select the folder you want (or command + A to select all) and then press:

*

*Command + right arrow
And the left arrow undoes what the right arrow did, should you want to close things back up again. Using option instead of command works on all folders enclosed in the selected folder. Both option and command modify a mouse selection on the folder toggle icon “triangle” or “arrow” to execute these shortcuts using the GUI.

A: I find mouse/trackpad-clicking the triangle while holding the Alt/Option or Command key works too.
