Q: Is it possible to show multi-level threads in Mail.app? I like the threaded view for mail.app, but it only groups the messages per thread. In other words, there's only two levels: the original messages, and all the replies that came after that.
Is it possible (perhaps via plugin?) to show a multi-level view of the e-mail thread in mail.app?

A: I'm sorry; that's not possible.

A: As an alternative to the lack of Mail features (good threading being one of those), you can try any of the following, which I’m sure you already know:


*

*Postbox: Lots of features, multiplatform, not free.

*Thunderbird: Very decent mail client, free and also multiplatform. 

*Mailplane: If you like Gmail but don’t want to lose OS X features, Mailplane is a very decent alternative combining the best of gmail with a respectable OS X integration. 

*Sparrow: A new alternative (only for gmail) that is growing in popularity for its ease of use and iPad-like interface. Although it only works for gmail, the plan is to expand it. Still very beta. Still free. Worth to follow around and check every now and then.

*There may be others but these are the most known/used (excluding Mail.app of course). Eudora is also popular, but I believe it’s a little bit outdated.
