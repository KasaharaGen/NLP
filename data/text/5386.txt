Q: How do I pause a download in the Launchpad in OS X Lion? I started downloading XCode on my 10 mbit/s but it is 4 GB and I want to pause it for a while.

A: Open Mission Control and just click on the Downloading Xcode icon. This will pause it. Clicking again will resume.

A: If you're downloading via the App Store, if you click on the Purchased icon at the top of the App Store window, I think that there's the option to Pause an active download. I seem to remember seeing it while I downloaded Lion earlier today.
