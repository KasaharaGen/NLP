Q: Cut command shortcut problem I cannot find the way to change the key shortcut for cut command on my macBook pro.
Where can I change that setting?
I can't find it with the rest of the key command preferences.

A: On my machine, the following works:
Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts. Press the [+] button. Select All Applications, type Cut, press your shortcut, and press Add.
Note that on systems still running OS X 10.8 and earlier, it's: System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts
