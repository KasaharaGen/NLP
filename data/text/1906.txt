Q: Is it possible to hide all theme related packages from Cydia? Cydia is spammed by too many skinning tweaks and it is real hard to browse for more interesting applications.
Do you know a way to make Cydia hide the theme-related packages?

A: Cydia > Sections > Edit
Turn the toggle to "Off" next to the "Theme" sections.
