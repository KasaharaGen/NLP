Q: How to auto show unarchived files in Finder? Currently Archive Utility is configured to unzip all archives opened by me in their directory.
While this is good it is not enough for me, I want it to show me the result in Finder.
How can I obtain this behavior, is there a hidden switch?

A: Instead of Archive Utility.app, I recommend The Unarchiver. It'll show the extracted files  in Finder. (I'm not sure if it's default behavior but you can change the setting in preferences.)
