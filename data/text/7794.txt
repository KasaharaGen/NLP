Q: Line select for modification I have used Microsoft Windows for 15+ years and am a highly keyboard-centric user. My wife uses both iMac and MacBook Pro, which means a full keyboard and a MacBook keyboard. Occasionally, I use her computers to see if I can migrate to Apple world. Web-surfing and video-watching are okay, but I find myself stressed by using MacBook keyboards and Mac when I work. Please teach me how I can do the following jobs or solve these problems:


*

*Home, End : When I edit text (like in MS Word) in Windows, I many times use Shift+Home to select a line if I am at the end of the line, or Shift+End to select a line if I am at the beginning of the line. I am not with a Mac now so I can't remember, but I remember such a line-selecting resulted in a different result in Mac. I guess it went to the page top with Home. Can I change Mac keyboard setting so that I get the same behavior for line selection?

*How can I do the above line selection task using a MacBook keyboard (with no visible home/end keys)?

A: Lion now has the behavior you expect in #3. 
To do line selection, use command and the left and right arrow keys. Add shift to select.
(Command-left to replace Home, Command-right to replace End.)

A: You select a line on a Mac by holding ⌘, Shift (to start the selection), and ← or →.
