Q: Stop Safari from loading webpages as Preview images Everyday, the first time I start Safari, if I go to the history or bookmarks tab, I get the following message: 

How can I stop Safari from prompting this message and completely disable the webpages Preview?
I already set the update policy to 2 with this:
defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy -int 2


A: Try running this command in the terminal:
defaults write com.apple.Safari DidPromptToFetchRecentHistoryPreviews -bool YES
