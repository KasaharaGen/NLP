Q: I upgraded to Lion. Where's my TRIM support? I upgraded to Lion a couple of weeks ago, looking forward to the promised TRIM support on my 2009 MacBook Pro. It seems that the upgrade hasn't enabled it. There doesn't seem to be any way of doing so in the disk manager. Am I missing something?


A: Have you booted into recovery mode and try "repair disk" using Disk Utility to ensure updated drivers on the SSD? It should have happened at installation, but several lion installs silently failed to make even a Recovery HD for me.
It's a guess, but I could see Disk Utility perhaps correcting that oversight.
I would certainly open a ticket with Apple Care - you get 90 days of phone support with any purchase and can even schedule a call back from the web site I linked. It might initially warn you about pay per incident, but later on you can select this exemption:
