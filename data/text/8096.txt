Q: is there an app button for the voice control on an iPhone 4? is there any way besides holding the home button to get to the voice control on the iPhone 4 like an app button or anything?

A: The (very) short answer is "No there isn't". 

A: If you bring the phone up to your ear, Siri should activate. However, the only button for interacting with Siri is the home button.
