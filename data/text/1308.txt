Q: Cannot restore or recover ipod Classic 80gb I have an ipod Classic 80gb.   It is currently stuck on the apple screen.  I am unable to recover or restore the ipod.  It is not recognized by windows as either a ipod or a mass storage device.   When I plug it into my PC nothing happens.   
It just sits there with the apple logo on the screen.  None of the buttons respond with the exception of a reset.  (toggle hold switch -> hold center + menu for 6 seconds.)  A reset will cause the screen to go blank for a few seconds.  
Nothing else I have found seems to work.  
Let me know if you have any ideas

A: You can try to diagnose the problem with the diagnostic mode.
To enter the diagnostic mode, press the folowing key when the apple logo appears after a reset :
iPod 1G, 2G et 3G, press the keys for 5 seconds : 


*

*"back"

*"next"

*"select"


iPod 4G, 5G, mini et nano,  press the keys for 5 seconds :


*

*"back"

*"select"


In the diagnotic mode, you can navigate in the menus with the back/next keys and launch a bunch of test.

A: The hard disk has probably failed. If so, your options include:


*

*Buy a new iPod

*Buy a replacement hard drive on eBay (etc) and replace it.

*Find a used iPod somewhere and swap parts to yours until it works.
