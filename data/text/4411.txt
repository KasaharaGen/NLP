Q: Why are my DVD disks in the wrong format? I'm trying to play DVDs on my MacBook Pro however the disk doesn't play it doesn't even mount.  
When I check Disk Utility it shows the format as Windows NTFS 3G.
If I try the same disks on another macbook it shows as Universal Disk Format (UDF) and plays fine.  How do I fix this?

A: It appears Parallels is the cause of the issue.  Found some instructions on paragon-software.com and executed step 1. DVDs now working great!
