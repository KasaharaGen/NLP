Q: Is there a way to change the displayed desktop in Mission Control? I'd like to be able to change the displayed desktop in Mission Control without actually exiting Mission control.  For example, if I'm on desktop 1 and I go into Mission Control, I see all of the applications in that desktop along with thumbnails for the other desktops.  Can I view the applications in the one of the other desktops without having to click on it and leave Mission Control and then go back into Mission Control?

A: Push Ctrl + ← or → It also can be done by swiping if you have a Magic Mouse or Trackpad.

A: Yes, you can.
Hold down the option key and click on the desktop.
The desktop you clicked on will slide into view.
