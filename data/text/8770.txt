Q: How can I import an iDVD project into DVD Studio Pro? I don't know if this is even possible, but how can I import an iDVD project into DVD Studio Pro? I really want to be able to copy an iDVD project and tweak it in DVDSP.
I am using DVDSP 4.2.2 and iDVD 7.1.2.

A: This seems to be a way to go about it, but this only seems to work for iDVD 4.0 or earlier.
I'm not sure how relevant this is to you though, because I don't know the versions of the software you are using.
I have zero experience working with iDVD but maybe it is possible to save your project in an older format / convert it to an older format, to make sure it can be imported.
