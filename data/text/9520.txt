Q: Why does the menubar hide when I'm in iTunes? Often when I'm using iTunes 10.4, the menubar will hide and show like the dock does when you set it that way. I don't know of any settings that allow for that to happen on the menubar. Is it a bug or a setting that I accidentaly changed?

A: It sounds like you're running iTunes in full screen mode if you're on Lion. In the top right corner you should have a button with two arrows that allows you to switch between full screen mode and regular mode.

A: If this is due to a setting or false install, try this:
Use an advanced cleaning to fully remove iTunes:
AppCleaner http://freemacsoft.net/#
Then reinstall iTunes.
This will not delete your music, movies, apps! Only the program.



A: On the left top corner you see the square button half black half clear colour,press that button you will see the option available ,select "the show menu bar ",it will solve your problem.

A: .. just maximize your iTune window , and move the mouse to the top of the screen, then you see the menu bar drop down, when you move the mouse away it disappears again. (iTune 11x)

A: just move the cursor to the top border of the screen
