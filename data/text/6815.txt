Q: Plain text paste on Firefox on OSX ctrl + shift + V does plain text paste on Chrome and Firefox on Linux and Windows (removes all HTML formatting from WYSIWYG pasted text).
I think Chrome honours cmd + shift + V, but this doesn't seem to work in Firefox 6. 
Is there a shortcut to paste as plain text on Firefox? 

A: If Firefox doesn't support this, you can use Plain Clip as a workaround.
