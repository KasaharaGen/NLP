Q: Is the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M on the MacBook Pro good for gaming? I want to know what kind of games can I play with my MacBook Pro before I purchase them. Can I play something beyond Bejeweled? Type of games that I am interested in playing:


*

*Call of Duty

*Counter Strike Source

*Civilization


A: I have a 5,2 MacBook with that Nvidia chip. Being the Civ fan that I am, I used to Bootcamp and try to play Civ IV: BTS but it wasn't pretty. I suppose if you turned the graphics settings way down to the minimum you may have some luck.
Civ V. No hope at all.

A: Counter Strike Source will have little to no trouble because the Source Engine relies more on the CPU than GPU.

A: I had crysis, and crysis 2 running, with playable FPS. Crank down the resolution.
