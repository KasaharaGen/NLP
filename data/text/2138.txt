Q: How to make a jailbroken iPhone appear un-jailbroken to network provider? I'd like to jailbreak my iPhone but have it appear to my network provider as if it isn't jailbroken. This should be do-able, but what do I need to do to make this happen?  
I have an iPhone 4 currently running iOS 4.2.
EDIT:  Canadian politics is tricky.  Part of the potential new copyright law would make defeating any sort of weak sauce encryption illegal. Essentially, the copyright holder would have it's rights fully supported, and as for the user, well they get what's left. This is going on at the same time as our bandwidth cap issues. I just want to be proactive, for when the "unforseen QoS problems" begin to arise here. So, not a neutral ISP situation.  

A: The network provider can't see if it's jailbroken or not. They might be able to detect if you're using Skype over 3G or other non-3G apps but they won't be able to discover it by simply jailbraking it.

A: The only visible change that jailbreaking does is the installation of the cydia app on your homescreen.
what i would suggest is to go into cydia and get an app called Poof to hide the cydia icon. You can follow the guide here http://www.iphoneappsandhacks.com/how-to-hide-icons-on-iphone-or-ipod-touch.html, or you can hide it in a folder with a bunch of other apps.

A: If that's true why can some apps detect it anyway? I installed e.g. Voddler on my iPhone yesterday; a free app to see movies without a charge. I can't see any movies because the app detected my iPhone as jailbroken and I got a message saying that jailbroken devices are not allowed to play the movies.
