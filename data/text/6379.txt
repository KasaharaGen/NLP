Q: Accesing iphone gps position from the macbook? I observed that an ipad (wifi) connected to a personal hotspot made by an iphone does get also the GPS position.
The question is how can I get this from a MacBook Pro?
I would like to use it with apps like Google Earth.

A: I don't have an iPhone 4 to test this, but I assume Core Location will do.
Here's a simple sample application with a map (and coordinates).
Lucubrator is also an option, and comes with some more information.
