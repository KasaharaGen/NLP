Q: ctrl alt h shortut not being caught by my active program anymore this is what I get when pressing that combo. Also, some strange window frame gets drawn along the active sub-windows... I do not know how I have managed to screw it like that but would surey like to revert to normal. Help please


A: That's VoiceOver, an accessibility tool. Go to System Preferences → Universal Access → Seeing, and set VoiceOver to Off.
