Q: iPad workspaces Is there an app that allows one to create "workspaces" on the iPad?
A workspace is essentially a particular set of open documents/windows that can be saved and reopened later.
This allows you to forget "setting up" by opening apps and loading documents every time, and makes the experience more task-oriented.  Workspaces could easily make working on the iPad 10 times more productive.

A: In short, no.
However, so long as you do not run the thing totally flat, and assuming that all apps you use are compiled to use the features available like auto-resume and saved states etc, there is no reason why once you have got the iPad into the configuration you like, it won;t stay that way untless you change it.  Opening Pages or iPod or Notes should always start where you left it.  But from a clean start, or to refresh your entire app status across multiple apps to a saved state is not possible as a single operation.
