Q: Prevent Bonjour Announcements Over OpenVPN We have an OpenVPN server at work, which I use frequently to access private work resources. When I do, the "Shared" listed in Finder populates with all the automatically announced servers/resources at work, but the reverse is also true. My local resources appear to anyone at work, and/or on the VPN as well.
Ideally, I would like to prevent my announcements from going over the VPN link, but would like to have the shares physically at work available to me while on the VPN. If the only method is to disable Bonjour (temporarily), I'll be fine with that, but is there a way to make it only one-sided?
And of course the master question: How do I accomplish this, at all, in the first place.

A: How about blocking udp traffic on port 5353?

A: Usually, Bonjour only works on the local network and only its extension Wide-Area-Bonjour works through VPNs. Did you configure your Computer to use that or did you setup your router to handle that? Also, which other resources appear for the others at work?
But anyway, you don´t have to have File Sharing "turned on" on your computer (which will then cause the broadcasting of your computer´s name over Bonjour) to access others, so just turn off the services you don´t want others to see and you should be good.

A: If you are using OpenVPN, I assume you are using Linux on the server side.
Since OpenVPN is working in layer 2 bridge mode, applying a standard filter with iptables will not work. iptables works on layer 3 and your VPN is before that in the layer 2.
The trick is to use ebtables wich is like iptables but at layer 2.
You can block UDP port 5353 with ebtables.
