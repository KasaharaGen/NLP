Q: buffering location /tmp? I was a long time Ubuntu user before I moved on to a Mac; so I'm used to seeing videos on YouTube and copying the buffered files from /tmp to another place for later viewing, if I like the video.
I tried doing the same on my Mac but its not working. Are the videos being buffered to a location other than /tmp?

A: Likely they reside in the Application's Cache directory.
Look into (HOME)/Library/Caches and (HOME)/Library/Application Support

A: As an alternative, you can use something like Tooble to watch videos and later download them in the format of your choice. It has a free and a pro version as far as I know. I use the free and it works.
