Q: Will a sata3 SSD work properly on a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU? I have a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU and willing to upgrade its HDD to SSD. 
Can I use a sata3 SSD for it?

A: Yes, you can.  
Here are the theoretical bus speeds 
SATAI   - 150 MB/sec - 1.5 Gb/sec
SATAII  - 300 MB/sec -  3 Gb/sec 
SATAIII - 600 MB/sec -  6 Gb/sec
In theory, a very fast drive could saturate a SATA2 bus, but if it does, it will still send the data, just slower than it's capable of.  If that bothers you, just buy a slower SATA2 SSD drive.
Regardless, you'll be very happy with the performance upgrade over a slower drive.  It's the best upgrade investment you can make.  

A: SSDs with SATA-X are backward compatible.

*SATA3 is compatible with SATA3, SATA2 and SATA1 connections

*SATA2 is compatible with SATA2 and SATA1 connections


I for example use a SSD with a SATA3 capability on a SATA1 bus. (Crucial m4 in MBP 3.1)
My advice:
Always take the latest SSDs. They have a more refined garbage collection. It's also preferable to take a SSD with SATA3 in order to profit from the faster bus speed in case you use the SSD in another computer some day.

A: Nope, because SATA3 in a Mini began with the 2011 models, or with Core i5/i7 processors. The SSD would saturate the SATA2 bandwidth, but I don't see why you would spend more money for the little extra speed it's gonna give you. Stick with SATA2 SSDs is my advice.
