Q: songs about OS X or iOS? I know of just one song, but are there other songs out there?
James Dempsey - Model View Controller

A: James Dempsey and the Breakpoints do a song every year at WWDC.  Knowing the secret to which session will have the song requires knowing some very subtle clues to watch for in some of the Monday sessions.
