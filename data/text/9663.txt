How to turn off the iOS-style character picker menu 

When I am writing and I hold number pressed, as when you write the number 9999999999, a dialog appears. 
It ask me wether I want to write 9ª or 9º. I want none of them, I just want to write the number. 
This is very annoying, how can I deactivate this behaviour altogether?

A: You need re-enable key repeat for this context menu to go away. It'll affect character keys as well as number keys.


*

*Open Terminal.app

*Enter the following to turn this context menu feature off and reenable the old key repeat behaviour: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
And you're done. Holding down any key now should repeat that key in the text entry window instead of calling up that context menu to select alternate characters.
To turn the context menu feature back on enter: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true instead.
