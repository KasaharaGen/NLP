Q: Disable the "None of your preferred networks are available" dialog on OS X How do I disable that horribly annoying dialog that tells me I am not connected to any wifi network?


None of your preferred networks are available.
Choose the Wi-Fi network you want to join from the list below.


Edit:
I use the wifi.
So why do I want the dialog gone?

*

*The dialog only shows up when I have no internet connection. Great. That dialog won't magically help me know encryption keys to random networks I am around. There is only like one time that it was useful, and thats the first time I ever turned this machine on.

*The dialog is annoying.

*The dialog has zero uses. I can use the status bar icon to do all the needed work that the dialog provides, except I get to chose when to stop and use it, not the dialog choosing "stop what ur doing and connect to the f-ing internet"


A: *

*Open the Network pane of the System preferences.

*Select AirPort in the list on the left.

*Uncheck the “Ask to join new networks” checkbox. 

*Et voilà!  :)


A: There are two options that I could see that might work for you Uncheck ask to join new networks and try unchecking show wifi status in bar. These are options available in the Network Preferences. You could also try to set the wifi service to inactive. Click the service cog at the bottom left while the wifi service is selected.
If all else fails just turn the wifi off. I assume you aren't using it since you want to disable the warnings and you know its not connected.
