Q: iPad camera to cloud I'm looking for a truly basic app that takes photos with the built-in camera and uploads them somewhere in the cloud.
I stress basic because I need my photos to be easily programmatically reused without a lot of translation (glue code) on my part.  For example: a Media RSS feed with nothing but the photos themselves, or a WebDAV folder.

A: Apparently this is the functionality of Photo Stream on iCloud. Requires iOS5 and Lion (or a recent Windows version) though.
