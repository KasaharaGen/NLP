Q: Stream All Audio to Speakers I'm looking for a device that will wirelessly stream my computer (13" Macbook Pro) audio to my 5.1 speakers. I've seen that AirPort supports 2.0 streaming of iTunes music, but I'd like support for all audio and surround sound (for games and movies). Does anyone know of a product or software for this? 

A: Have you considered Airfoil by Rogue Amoeba? http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/

A: Check out the WiFi2HiFi app. It can stream audio from any computer program to the iPhone, iPod or iPad:

Use WiFi2HiFi to turn your iPhone into a wireless audio receiver for your stereo system or sound-dock. Combined with the desktop app WiFi2HiFi Station you can listen to whatever audio program is playing on your computer.
Plug your iPod or iPhone into your hi-fi and enjoy your favorite music program, web radio or streaming service in crystal clear stereo quality.
WiFi2HiFi Station acts like an additional audio output on your computer. This allows the application to provide streaming support for all popular audio programs on the Mac and PC.
