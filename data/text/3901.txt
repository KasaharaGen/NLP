Q: Purchased video on iTunes rather than gifting, can this be corrected? My friend tried to gift me a film in the iTunes store but he says that somehow he "received" it by mistake (his mistake, most likely).
What are his options now.  Can he:


*

*Return the purchase

*"Gift" the purchase to me

*Call someone to correct the error and reassign the item to me instead?


A: bckbck is correct in terms of the letter of the law. All sales are final. However, your friend may have some luck contacting iTunes customer service and explaining the situation. They're aware that mistakes happen, and are sometimes happy to rectify them for you - though they are not obliged to do so.
All iTunes customer service is carried out via email. Here's a link to an email page your friend can use to explain the issue to iTunes customer service.

A: No.
From the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions:

All sales and rentals of products are final.
