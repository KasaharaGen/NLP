Q: can i print from an apple computer to a Dell printer i just got a dell printer that is WIFI because my old printer broke.  my wife now wants to buy an apple computer or laptop.  Would she be able to print from an apple computer to a dell printer?

A: Yes.
Macs have built-in drivers that allow you to print to just about any USB printer.
And if the computer doesn't already have drivers (although, just about every consumer printer does), Dell supplies drivers for Mac.
You may also need to install the custom drivers if you want more advanced functionality (e.g, some brands require you to install their drivers to enable networked print).
You can easily add printers using the the Print & Scan pane of System Preferences: Just click the plus button.


A: It depends on the Dell printer model you have bought. I have a Dell Color Laser 1320cn (with wired network) hooked up to my MBP. I ended up using some FujiXerox Docuprint driver to get everything working.

A: Is it a USB printer? If so, it should work without any hassle, just plug it in and add it under the Print & Fax section of System Preferences.
