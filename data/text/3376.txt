Q: iPhoto '11 vs. iPhoto '09 keyboard shortcuts In iPhoto '09 looking at a picture in an event, I could hit Esc to get back to the event. It appears that this no longer works in iPhoto '11.
Is there a different keyboard shortcut that works?

A: After fiddling around a bit, it seems that ⌘+← works.

A: All keyboard shortcuts can be found on Apple's iPhoto Keyboard Shortcuts website.
