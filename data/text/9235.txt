Q: Does disabling iMessage read receipts stop me from receiving them? When I turn off Send Read Receipts in iMessage, does that disable me from receiving read receipts from others as well? I have noticed that I only receive read receipts when I have the feature turned on. 

A: The functionality is for messages to get delivered via SMS if that is enabled and iMessage is disabled or not available for the sender.
iMessage should / is designed to receive messages whether or not you are sending back read receipts as long as you and the recipient are on devices that match in Apple's database of recipients that are iMessage capable.
Something else is up - it could be related to the switch (as software corruption can act in weird ways) but it's certainly not the typical behavior.

A: Read receipts come to you whether or not you have the feature enabled. It shows up under the message you last sent in place of the word "Delivered" and it just says "Read" ...after a period of time it tacks on the time it was read too.

A: ok, Ian did pretty good, but I think he could have been a bit more clear with it.
Read Receipts tell the person who sent YOU a message, if you read their message or not. If YOU are SENDING a message, it does NOT matter if YOUR read receipt option is on or off. If the person you sent the message TO have read receipts ON, then directly under the message you sent, if will tell you if they read your message or not. If the person you sent the message to has the option turned OFF, then you will not know if they read your message or not.
So if you turn off read receipts, then people who sent you messages will not know if you read them yet. That's all it does.
