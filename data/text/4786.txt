Q: Dual screens with different resolutions I have my MBP connected to another screen with a smaller resolution. Thus when I want to move a window on the other screen, I have to resize it first to that it fits, then I can make it full screen again.
Is there a more convenient way to do that ?

A: I recommend that you use a window manager. I use Divvy ($14), which lets me press a one keyboard shortcut to move a window to the other monitor and resize it to full-screen.

A: I'll recommend a similar product Size Up which lets you move and resize windows with keyboard shortcuts.  Its $13 nagware, so free if you don't mind it pestering you occasionally.
