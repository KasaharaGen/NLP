Q: How Do I Run Xcode I just downloaded and installed Xcode on my MacBook Pro, but I don't see it under Applications or Utilities.  I also don't see a shortcut at the bottom.  How do I run it?

A: Xcode is located in /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app. Double-click it to open it. If you want, you can make an alias to it in your applications folder.

A: After you buy Xcode from the App Store you will be left with an 'Install Xcode' application in your Applications folder -- run that. It'll do the actual install and after all of that is said and done you'll have a /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app application in your PATH.
