Q: How can I upgrade PHP on a jailbroken iPhone? I have an iPod touch running iOS 4.0 and an iPad running iOS 4.3.1, both jailbroken. They have lighttpd and PHP installed, however PHP seems to be an old version that I need to upgrade to use a WebSocket script.
How would I go about updating it? According to a phpinfo() call, it has been configured with parameters to do with iOS, would this matter?
Update 20/7/11 You can find my phpinfo at this tinypaste.
Thanks in advance for all of your help. Ad@m

A: If you build the iPhone toolchain in you local environment, you can compile PHP locally and then move it to iOS.

I've not done this, but I'm curious, and will make an attempt myself over the next few days, and update this answer as I go along.
