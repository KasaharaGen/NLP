Q: Windows print screen when using Boot Camp I have bootcamp installed on my Mac, and when on Windows, I need to frequently capture screens using windows shortcuts such as Print Screen.
Using virtualization is not an option, since I need to run a virtualized environment within Windows already.
On the Mac keyboard (I have a MacBook Pro, and an external think aluminum keyboard), there isn't a print screen key. Is there any equivalent when using a mac keyboard?

A: Follow these instructions in order to map the F13-F15 keys on an Apple keyboard to the functions, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Break commonly found on PC keyboards:


*

*On your PC, copy the following lines into a text file.


REGEDIT4
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,46,E0,5F,00,46,00,5E,00,37,E0,5D,00,00,00,00,00


*

*Rename the text file remap.reg

*Double click on the file remap.reg and answer yes to the question about adding the information to the registry

*Reboot


Function keys are now remapped to their PC equivalents
