Q: C++ code navigation on OS X I'm an OS X newbie. Other than setting up Emacs / Vim with ctags or cscope or both, are there alternatives to C++ code navigation of an existing code base? I used to use Source Insight on Windows and it worked for me fairly well. I know I can setup ctags or cscope but I was wondering if there is anything even better out there. The main functionality I am looking for is quickly find definition of variables and functions and places a function is being called.

A: Is Xcode not what you're looking for ? It's the Mac OS X IDE. It'sn't installed by default, but is present on your Mac OS X DVD.

A: TextMate and BBEdit have significant followings.  I'm personally a big fan of Smultron even though development has stopped.

A: In Xcode:

quickly find definition of variables
  and functions

Right-click the variable name in question, and select "Jump to Definition".
Command (apple button) + double click on the variable is a shortcut for the same thing.

quickly find places a function is
  being called

Right-click the function name, and select "Find in Project" > "As Text".

A: I have used Eclipse for C++ programming on OS X. 
Xcode will compile things but is not that good at dealing with C++ namespaces it is more of a C and Objectve-C tool
