Q: Config a function key to activate the [App : Show All] command [my first question here...]
Is there a good way to map a function key to do the [App : Show All] command? i.e. Un-hide all apps.
BTW, i currently use Spark to map function keys.

A: Check out the Keyboard preference pane:

In the Keyboard shortcuts tab, click the plus to add a new shortcut. Set the dropdown to "All Applications" and then type "Show All" (case sensitive!) as the menu item. Map it to whatever you like.
