Q: Settings to use in Garageband for creating sounds for an iPhone application? I'm trying to create sounds to be used with a mobile app for iPhone. Is there a default setting in Garageband? Or is there another best practices way to get this accomplished? The sounds are spoken word.
I've tried different effects and settings (and no effects), but there is either a lot of background noise, or it is much too loud in the ad hoc version.

A: If you use the internal mic of your mac or your iPhone you can not expect a good quality. You must use a real microphone like the one from Apogee.

A: If you mean using garageband for creating ringtones, it's pretty straight forward and require no special settings. From lifehacker:

Unfortunately Apple hasn't provided a similar tool for Windows users yet, and I imagine that won't happen for some time, if at all. But if you're a Mac owner, creating custom ringtones for your iPhone just became dead simple.
