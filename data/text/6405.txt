Q: Expanding recently added songs In my iPhone is there a way to get more "recently added" songs?
I have about 100 songs and I have added recently 5, now in my "recently added" I've got only those 5.

A: Recently Added is a smart playlist. In iTunes, select it, go to File â†’ Edit Smart Playlist, and change the criteria. For example:

Re-syncing your iPhone will apply these changes.
