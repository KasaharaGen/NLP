Q: Adding gedit to my PATH I finally made the jump and got a MacBook, and I'm trying to move in. I have the OSX port of gedit installed, but I'm having trouble adding it to my PATH. My current PATH looks like this:
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/Applications/gedit.app/Contents/MacOS/gedit:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH

as per a comment here.

A: Note: On OS X, you don't need /Application apps to be in the PATH to launch them.
open -a gedit

Check man open

A: You only need to add the path to the folder containing the gedit binary, not the path to the binary.
Try this
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/Applications/gedit.app/Contents/MacOS:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
