Q: Chrome Exposé in OS X Lion not working In Snow Leopard, Chrome had a feature that is like Exposé, but for the tabs.
The gesture to trigger it was a 3 finger swipe down.
And in Lion it just stopped to work.
Does anyone knows how to enable it in Lion?

A: *

*Go to URL chrome:flags.

*Enable Tab Overview.

*Restart Google Chrome.


Please note that this is an experimental feature.
