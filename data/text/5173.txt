Q: Remote Desktop Connection for Mac not being able to connect? I have the latest version of Remote Desktop Connection client form Mac (2.1.1), the one that is also included in Office 2011 but I am not able to connect to the Windows machine.
I checked the logs on the Windows machine and found nothing.
It keeps asking me for user/password/domain... and I am entering them properly.
FYI, the computer is on domain.

A: Solved the problem by leaving the domain, joining it back and rebooting the machine (Windows).
