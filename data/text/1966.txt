Q: personal folder in outlook stored on network share available on iphone? I am looking to swap out a BlackBerry for an iPhone from Verizon. On the BlackBerry we use an older version of the desktop synchronization software and I can access personal folders (Outlook 2007 and Exchange Server 2007) stored on a network share. Can you do that from an iPhone?

A: It appears that this works while using a VPN. The iPhone talks to the Exchange group policies, and can use all the mail folders (although, IMAP may be necessary for this). For more info, see this Apple doc (page 9).
