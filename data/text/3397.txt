Q: What causes all iWork apps to have blank, unusable documents after a reinstall? After deleting and re-installing the apps, I can't use iWork. Specifically, the document area is always empty, no matter if I create a new document or open an existing one. This applies to Pages, Numbers and Keynotes.
I can guess there's something in the document, because the mouse pointer changes when I move it over the empty area. So it seems like a display error. What can I do to resolve this?

A: I had a little trouble getting iWork '09 to work correctly on Mountain Lion.
When I tried to create a new document from template chooser, it was blank, and I could not do anything.
When I tried to open an existing file, it said it "file  could not be opened".
This applied for Numbers, Pages, and Keynote.
This is how I solved it,


*

*Moved the iWork Folder in Applications to Trash.

*Removed /Library/Application Support/iWork '09

*Re-Installed iWork (I had installation Media).

*Then installed the Mountain Lion iWork updates.


Hope that works for you.

A: Check if you have the font colour set to white.

A: I have the same problem. If I open an existing or new iWork version 9.0.3 Pages document under OS X 10.7.2 only a blank document is visible. Anything entered remains invisible.
I find however that if I restart the iMac at this point, a Pages document opens properly - that is, it now becomes visible.

A: Install this update: Pages 08 3.0.3
