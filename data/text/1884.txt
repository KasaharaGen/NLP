Q: Always Asked to Configure Firewall for iTunes Whenever I open iTunes, I get the standard OS X dialog, Do you want the application "iTunes.app" to accept incoming network connections?
Every time I click allow, but I am asked the same thing without fail the next time I open iTunes.
In the Advanced section of the Firewall tab of the Security System Preferences pane, I see that iTunes is in fact set to allow. Changing the firewall settings makes no difference.
Any ideas for how to get this setting to stick?

A: I looked at Am1rr3za's article, and eventually it just said to reinstall iTunes, which I did.
That worked.
Am1rr3za, post as an answer if you want the points. Otherwise, I'll accept this one.
