Q: Reset Snow Leopard user accounts/preference My kids completely changed everything in their user account, what is the easiest way to reset everything to default (without reinstalling everything) including:


*

*Name of hard drive

*Menu items in Finder

*Dock size and items

*Size/appearance of things

*Even some applications have been moved from their original location


A: *

*Name of hard drive
Click enter, rename it

*Menu items in Finder
What do you mean by that?

*Dock size and items
Trashing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist will do the trick

*Size/appearance of things
Trashing the .plist file under ~/Library/Preferences

*Even some applications have been moved from their original location
You'll have to move them back to /Applications manually.
In order for that not to be reproduced, you could try Parental Controls under System Preferences > Account and limit what they can do on their account.

A: In addition to Loïc’s excellent answer

Menu items in Finder
What do you mean by that?

I believe he means the Finder’s Sidebar and such. In order to reset those, thrash the following file and logoff (or restart):
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist


Even some applications have been moved from their original location
You'll have to move them back to
/Applications manually.

Yes, unless he has a Time Machine backup… which I believe he doesn’t. :)
