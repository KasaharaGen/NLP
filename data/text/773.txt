Q: Tool for creating .rar files on the Mac? Is there any good, free program for OS X that can create RAR files? Preferably with a GUI.
It seems there are plenty of options for extracting RAR files, but not that many for compressing them...

A: Download simplyrar it free and easy to use.


A: You can use command line rar for Mac OS X, but it doesn't have GUI. On the other hand, it's useful for scripting. (I feel that it should be mentioned here anyway).

A: SimplyRar (download) will do the trick.

A: It's not free, but Rucksack is a great app to create all kind of archives, ".rar" included.  

A: BetterZip, it does rar's too, it's easy to use.
It does cost though.

A: Install WinRAR into a WineSkin wrapper. Works perfectly.
