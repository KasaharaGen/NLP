Q: How to close the window and quit the application when you press ESC key under OS X? On Windows it is something common to close a window by pressing ESC key. I'm looking for a solution that would allow me to close the current Window and the application when I press ESC.
Currently the Preferences panel does not allow you to set a shortcut for ESC.
Use case: you open a file from another application inside a viewer or editor and you want to return to the initial application just by pressing ESC once. 

A: Off the top of my head:
Downlod KeyRemap4Macbook

See if you can't find a setting for escape, I'm not sure if there is one.
Remap it to Command + Q.

A: You can press Command + W for closing the window and Command + Q to quit the applicaiton.
Like Open Word , open two different doc files and then if you wan to close only one file then just select that and press Command + w , only that file will be closed. 
Hope this is the solutions for you.
