Q: Increase horizontal speed scroll on Logitech Mouse I have a Logitech Mouse with a horizontal-scroll-enabled scroll wheel (it tilts left and right to scroll left and right) the only problem is that the scroll speed is very very slow to a point it is not worth using.
The normal mouse settings do not appear to alter the scroll speed at all.

A: Download the Logitech Control Center here. It will allow you to change the settings.
