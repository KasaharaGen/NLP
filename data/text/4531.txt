Q: How can I backup my system to a remote server (AFP, Samba, or NFS share)? Here's the goal: I have a backup server with a ZFS filesystem with built in compression and snapshots. All our machines backup there nightly with rsync, and then a ZFS snapshot is taken, so we have backups of how eveach machine looked at the end of every day.
The problem is that with Mac OS X, the resource forks are not copied since the remote machine does not support resource forks. What I would like to do is rsync to a .DMG file which resides on the backup server. This way, I'd have an exact, bootable image of how my system looked each night.
As a bonus, the backup server is also a NetBoot server, so this would actually allow me to boot from how my mac was at any point in history.
I created an image of my Mac's drive and copied it to the backup server. Now, when I open it on my mac and run rsync, it runs for a period (sometimes more than an hour, sometimes less) and then gives me a ton of I/O errors. The image is stored on a RAID array, I am sure there are no I/O errors.
I think the connection with the Samba share may be getting overwhelmed... I've tried with AFP also, and I get the same result... What could be causing this and how can I resolve it? Or, any other ideas on how I can update the remote DMG file?

A: Setup a new volume on your Nexenta/OS box for your backup and set it to share out as an iSCSI LUN. Then use one of several iSCSI initiators for MacOS X to attach the backup volume on your back. On your mac, format the volume as HFS+. Now you can use CCC or rsync, etc. to do your backups.

A: Have you looked into using Carbon Copy Cloner? I use this to a manual bit-for-bit backup of my SSD to a network drive once a month or so and it works flawlessly. I know it does incremental backups, and I've had no trouble dumping my drive over gigabit ethernet.

A: Not the exact answer to your question, but you can rsync resource forks too. Here are really nice articles about:

ps: do you use solaris or freebsd?
So, what im tried now:
I have a remote OS (not mac) and mouned it via fuse/sshfs (over the slow ADSL).
sshfs user@example.com:/path/to/dir /Users/me/Mount/myfs -oauto_cache,reconnect,volname=MyFs

On my macbook entered this:
/usr/bin/rsync -avE /Users/me/tmp/bk /Users/me/Mount/myfs/tmp/test

(the /tmp/test already exists on the remote computer)
and got this:
building file list ... done
bk/
._bk
bk/.DS_Store
bk/._.DS_Store
bk/Icon\#015
bk/._Icon\#015

bk/test.rtfd/TXT.rtf

sent 311127 bytes  received 186 bytes  15186.00 bytes/sec

As you can see, resource forks are converted into dot_underscore files and copied into remote location. (for example, the custom icon for the directory bk too).
Therefore i don't understand, why you can't rsync into remote zfs?

A: I don't know why, but the connection to the server was being broken during the file copy and I am assuming it was because the high amount of data being transferred at such high speed was more than the backup server could handle; it would become unresponsive for a short period and the Mac would forcibly disconnect the DMG, and the backup would fail.
I found a solution: before backing up, in System Preferences, I lowered my Ethernet NIC's speed from 1000Mbps to 100Mbps. Then, the backup seemed to work flawlessly, because the data rate was constrained and the backup server didn't get overwhelmed.
