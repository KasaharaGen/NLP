Is it possible to put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep? 

I have an iMac, and sometimes I want to play some music over night, without the bright display. The display will be turned off automatically several minutes later, but I would like a button that turns the display off instantly and keeps the music playing.
How can I do this?

A: Ctrl+Shift+Eject will turn off the displays but leave the computer active.
Control ⌃+Shift ⇧+Power ⌽ for some Macbook

A: Use ctrl + shift + Eject to turn off display.
You can also set a "hot-corner" to turn off display in a few seconds.
