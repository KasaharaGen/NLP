Q: I'm looking for an iPhone app to collect money (determine money goals) I wonder if there is an application (on iPhone) to determine money goals, for example I can set an aim "vacation on Hawaii - $5000" and see the progress from 0-100% after adding money.

A: Moneywell will look at what you are saving but shows the amount you have saved not the %age but you can set monthly/weekly budgets so that money is saved as you go along.

A: I suppose Numbers would do the trick.

A: Mint's budgeting features and goal tracking would seem to do what you want, but I don't know if those features are carried over to the Mint iPhone app to the point where you would be happy with them. It's free to sign up and for the mobile app, so you could try it out with only an investment of your time.
