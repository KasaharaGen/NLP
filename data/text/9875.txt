Q: Lion OS Remove Categorizing in Finder i just got my hands on lion after some years in previous mac versions. There is a feature in finder that i absolutely hate though. When i select Arrange By -> Date Modified, for instance, i get a categorized, incredibly inefficient view. Is it possible to get what i would normally get on leopard, just a list of last modified files, without the horrendous categories ?

A: Use the "clean up by" option, not the "arrange by" one.
