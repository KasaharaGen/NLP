Q: iPhone 4 - sound only comes out of one speaker I have notices that sound only comes out of one speaker on the bottom of my phone. Is it playing in mono or is the other "speaker" actually a microphone?

A: The iPhone 4 only has one speaker. The matching screen on the other side of the phone is for the microphone.
