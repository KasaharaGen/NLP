Q: How do I see full movie titles in iPad Video browser? On my iPad, long video titles are cut off even though there is lots of blank space everywhere. Even when I tap a video, the detail screen cuts off the title in the exact same location despite there still being lots of blank space everywhere.
Full movie titles are a lot more useful than blank space... Can I somehow see them at all when I'm away from my PC?

A: Tap and hold, you will get a popover until you let go with the full details.  Same works with music in the ipod app.
