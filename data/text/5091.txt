Q: mac mini server installation fails I am trying to reinstall a clean copy of Leopard Server on my Mac mini server. I have erased both disks and tried to reinstall the OS, but it's always stuck at 36 minutes.
The installation successfully finished once, but then the OS got stuck on the opening screen.
I have checked both disks with disk utility and both appear to be fine.
I would love any suggestions, as I don't know what to do next.
