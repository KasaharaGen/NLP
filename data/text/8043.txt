Q: iOS5 - Does the ActiveSync Pin code lock prevent the new camera shortcut? I've had an iPhone of various vintages for 3 years connected to MS Exchange activesync for work email.
Part of the deal with this that you need to enter a four digit PIN before you unlock. 
I was quite excited about the iOS5 camera option available from the lock screen. 
From what I can see - the camera shortcut is not available if you have ActiveSync enabled and thus the four digit PIN. I'm asking the question because I hope I am wrong. Here is my question:
Does the ActiveSync Pin code lock prevent the new camera shortcut?

A: No, the PIN Code doesn't prevent you from using the camera shortcut.
Just make sure to double-press the home button to show the camera shortcut.
Note: you can't access your old photos as long as the iPhone is locked.
