Q: How to get OS X out of a strange debug mode My two year old loves banging on the keyboard of my iMac and occasionally  discovers strange features that I've never seen before.
Most recently he has enabled what appears to be some kind of debug mode where there is a black box just above and to the left of the dock containing current windowing event info. I'll post a screengrab when I've got enough reputation to do so.

, and
This debug mode is also making apps such as my browser unusable as it tends to scroll back to the top of pages at regular intervals.
Does anyone know how to switch this off?
Another thing he managed to do was to create an empty folder on the desktop with the name "Time Machine", i.e. exactly the name of a volume on the desktop (he certainly didn't type that). It doesn't sound a particularly useful feature but I'd be interested to know how he did it.

A: Your kid managed to activate VoiceOver. To turn it if, go to Preferences/Accessibility (or try Command-F5 first)
