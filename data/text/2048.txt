Q: Is it possible to disable spellcheck for Coda but leave it enabled for other applications? I use Coda as web editor, and I usually have to mix Italian and English nouns and phrases. I don't want spellcheck on (as I use programming-related words such as uid and pid), so I'd like to deactivate it. 
At the same time, though, I'd like to have it enabled everywhere else on my computer.
It appears that Mac OS X doesn't have a way to enable spellcheck for some applications but disable it for others.
Is this possible?

A: Just right click in the working tab, select Spelling and uncheck the option "Check Spelling While Typing"


A: I don't know if it's possible (I doubt it), but here's a workaround: set a keystroke for the spellcheck menu item in System Preferences so you can easily turn it off or on.
