Q: New MacBook Pro won't wake from sleep without restart My girlfriend's new MacBook Pro will sometimes seem not to wake up from sleep. No amount of spacebar hits, enters, clicks, etc. seem to awake the computer. She's resorted to hard restarting the computer which is obviously not ideal. 
It seems to happen regardless of its state as it goes to sleep (closed lid, idle). 
Anyone else hear of this or have any ideas?

A: This is a common problem and is caused by the EFI being out of date. To fix this simple download and install MacBook Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.9
Hope this helps. All the best.
