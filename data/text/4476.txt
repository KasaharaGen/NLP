Q: Generic TWAIN driver for OS x? I am looking for a generic TWAIN driver for OS X, one that would not need additional hardware. I just want to use it for testing TWAIN.

A: I solved my problem by installing the demo version of VueScan. If someone else find a free tool that installs a driver that is visible in Photoshop, I will accept his answer :)

A: In  OS X TWAIN is not "The Scanner Standard" as in windows. For OS X  several scanner manufacturers make TWAIN drivers and some others make plugins into various applications and not TWAIN, so IMHO you cannot rely (only) on TWAIN.
For the testing/developent TWAIN/SANE may help you - check this link:

Access scanners via SANE - and enable the TWAIN datasource.
