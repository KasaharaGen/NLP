Q: Set up a password policy that has a maximum failed login attempts and a reset after a certain period of time I tried using pwpolicy to set this up.  I was able to set up maxFailedLoginAttempts, but setting minutesUntilFailedLoginReset doesn't seem to do anything.  When I query pwpolicy using:
 pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -getglobalpolicy

I keep seeing that minutesUntilFailedLoginReset=0 even though I just set it to 60.  I even tried changing this for one user, and it claims it was changed but when I query the user's policy or the effective policy nothing has changed.

A: I’m assuming that you’re aware that pwpolicy doesn’t affect Admin accounts (tho it may show you otherwise, leading to believe that it does). 
I also asume that you’re running the commands as sudo or at least have tried.
Other than that, I haven’t tried that value myself. As a side (and curious) note the minutesUntilFailedLoginReset is not in the manpage for pwpolicy. 
man pwpolicy
