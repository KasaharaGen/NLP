Q: Home and End commands in Lion After installing Lion, ⌘ + ← doesn't go to the line start and ⌘ + → doesn't go to the line end.
Anyone know how to reconfigure this?

A: Coming from Windows I've had a tough time adjusting to the way home and end behaves. Luckily the guys at MacroMates had a blog post about this.

Create a file at ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict with the following contents:
{
    /* home */
    "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
    "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";

    /* end */
    "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";
    "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";
}

I restarted and my keys were behaving as expected!

A: You could try restoring defaults by using the 'Restore Defaults' button in System Preferences shown below:  


A: Removing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist.lock and logging out and back in did the trick for me.

A: This problem was driving me crazy.

I didn't have a file with that name, but I had one with this very similar name:
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist
I moved that file to the trash, then logged out and back in. Problem gone. Hooray!
Thank you, Mr. Gentz!

A: It seems to have something to do with the language you selected.
I had mine set to English - Canadian (eh :P)
setting Language & Text > Input Sources 
uncheck English - Canadian 
check US
Once I did that my cmd + arrow key was back to normal.

A: Option + Command + right arrow (on the latest Lion update -- it changes)
