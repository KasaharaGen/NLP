Q: Wi-Fi sync missing from iTunes 10.5 This is really weird. I updated my iPhone to iOS 5 today, along with iTunes to version 10.5. According to Apple's own documentation, I should have an option to "sync with this iPhone over wifi" under the Summary tab when my iPhone is plugged in - but I don't!
Since I can't enable it, my iPhone doesn't "see" my computer when I go to Settings > General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync on my iPhone, even though both are on the same network.
The only thing I can think of is that it's because I'm running OS X 10.5? But I still have iTunes 10.5 and iOS 5, which is all that Apple says is required (they don't list a minimum required version of OS X itself).
Anyone have any idea how I can enable this?

A: I believe the minimum requirements are iOS 5 iTunes 10.5 and Snow Leapard 10.6.8. I have Leapard 10.5.8 (and the other requirements) I can't use wifi sync. The option isn't in iTunes. I saw someone say somewhere that they had 10.6.7 and they did have the option until they updated snow leapard to 10.6.8.

A: I just fixed this issue by restarting my macbook's wifi.
