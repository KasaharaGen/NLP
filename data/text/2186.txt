Q: Oil seeping from mbp keys? I have a pretty recent macbook pro 15in, aluminum unibody, probably not yet one year old.
It mainly gets used in clamshell mode connected to an external monitor.  I've noticed frequently now when I take it out for use as a proper laptop, the left side Option and Command keys have an oily substance seeping out of them, with a corresponding spot on the screen where it touches those keys when closed.
Any ideas on what's causing this?  

A: Sounds like oil from your hands to be honest

A: As far as I know, the only places on a MacBook Pro that have any liquid in them are the LCD and the battery. In either case, it's not pleasant stuff, and definitely shouldn't be leaving it's respective container.
If it's only a year old, take it to the Apple store for service. But first, wash your hands.
