Q: What can be the different filetypes of videos shot using iPhone/iPod Touch? Is it mp4 or m4v or mov? I'm not sure. Please tell me what can be the different formats shot using iPhone or iPod Touch
THANX!!

A: The iPhone and iPod touch only shoots one format:
H.264 in a .mov container - at 1280x720 at 30 FPS.
