Q: Group running apps in OS X? Since I'm working on several projects that require different resources (shells, files, Chrome windows, etc.), I'd like to organize them better.
Is there a Mac utility or something that will allow me to group a bunch of app windows together to represent a specific task?  
For instance I can group Chrome window, Finder window, shell into one group (this would be one project), and then a bunch of those into another group, etc.

A: An out-of-the-box possibility would be to use Spaces to define applications to go to a specific screen on launch, and navigate between Spaces (Virtual Desktops) as a whole.
Note, however, that you will have a conflict if you want the Finder to be in two places at once :). Your only option is one specific Space, or globally across all Spaces.

A: As @VxJasonxV wrote, Spaces is the solution.
If you want a bigger sandbox, you could probably run a dozen VMs if you had a desktop with 32GB or so of RAM. I think you'll need a license for each VM.
