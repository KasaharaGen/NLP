Q: How tell Safari to open new tab instead of a window How do I tell Safari to always open links that want a new window in a new tab?
I know I can use cmd-click to do this but that's not what I want. 
There has to be a setting somewhere?

A: You can use Safari preferences (âŒ˜ ,) to change this setting, you can use automatically or always for opening pages in new tabs instead of new windows.


A: In safari preferences (command + ,) on the "Tabs" tab you can set this options. 
Or you can right click the link and choose the option you want. Or depending on your current configuration command + click on the link could open the link on a new page or a new tab.
