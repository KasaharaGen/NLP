Q: Airplay speakers stop playing when VPN connection is established I have Zeppelin Air from B&W which works great most of the time. However during VPN connection to different work places during VPN connection Airplay stops playing. If I then go to iTunes and play next song it starts to work again. My VPN connections don't have Default VPN Gateway set so there's really nothing that should be affecting AirPlay. Is this normal? Any workarounds ?
