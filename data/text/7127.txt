Q: Methods to install X11 on Lion My girlfriend recently ordered a MacBook Pro with Lion installed. For an online class she needs GIMP which depends on X11. What are my options to get it? Is there any Apple-sanctioned way to do the install? Would there be any downside to using the SL DVD from my machine? Or should I just install XQuartz?

A: As a matter of fact Lion DOES ship with X11. There were many doubts, and many believed it wouldn't, but it does. 
Source: me. Ive got xeyes running on my Lion iMac right now. :)

A: I've found this post is very helpful to install GIMP on Mac OS X Lion:

Just go to http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html and download the GIMP 2.6.11 for Leopard version on your Lion. I’ve tried the Snow leopard and Tiger version but that doesn’t work for me.
