Q: How do I install QuickTime 10.1 on Snow Leopard? I haven't upgraded to Lion yet and was thinking of keeping this Mac running Snow Leopard and buy a new Mac with Lion.
So I hope to install the newest QuickTime 10.1 on the current Mac running Snow Leopard.  It already has QuickTime 10.0 (128) so it can record the screen as .mov, but it can't select a region on the screen to do the recording like on a Lion Mac in the Apple Store (which has QuickTime 10.1).  (so QuickTime 10.0 must record the full screen, it seems, and the duo core CPU is not powerful enough).
But I don't see any upgrade link inside QuickTime's about or help, and I don't see it on Apple's website (only QuickTime 7 is available).  Is it possible to upgrade to QuickTime 10.1 on Snow Leopard?

A: Snow Leopard already comes with QuickTime X. And as for trying to port Lion's version to Snow Leopard, that can't be done. QuickTime is a core component and like any integral piece of software, requires many libraries and APIs only available on Lion. It's not as simple as trying to copy over the contents of an .app bundle.
