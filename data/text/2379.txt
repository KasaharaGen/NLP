Q: Is there any way to turn off the automatically opening window for a preview in Marsedit? Whenever I open a post to edit it a whole preview window opens up along with it. I find this effect disorienting. I looked in the preferences and couldn't find anything. How do I shut off the automatic opening?

A: Yes - this is a per blog preference.
I found this on the Mars Edit support page...


*

*Double click the blog in the main window to open settings.

*Click the "Editing" pane.

*Find the "Preview Defaults" at the bottom of that section.


Here's a picture showing that you can choose to have it off or remember the last state as well as the default option of opening.
