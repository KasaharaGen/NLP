Q: Mac Mini has loud fan, won't power up My intel-based mac mini (Model A1283, EMC 2336) refuses to boot. When I plug it in, the fan spins up very loudly, but then nothing happens when I hit the power button. I don't get a boot chime, and the power light on the front doesn't turn on.
I've followed the directions here for resetting the SMC, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.
What are my options? Do I need to schlep it in for some applecare attention?

A: The best option would be to systematically go through the manufacturer steps for troubleshooting a mac mini that won't boot. Even if you don't see the power light - do run through the no video steps as well - it might save you a trip or a call with a tech.
Best of luck!
