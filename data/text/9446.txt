Q: Apply display settings for a folder recursively Question
When I change the display settings in Finder, it is only applied for the current folder that I'm in.
I want to apply a display settings for all (sub-)folders in ~/Pictures. 
Since it's only for ~/Pictures, using the option 'Use as Defaults' will not help me. How can I do this?

Solution (thanks to @hobs)
The following tutorial uses an automator workflow. The workflow has to be run again when you add a new subdirectory to ~/Pictures.




A: I think your question fits with this thread and my answer to it:
System-wide finder view preferences
Short answer, it isnt that easy, but if you are willing do to some work you can make it happen.

A: Laborious but should do what you want: open each subfolder, set the display settings you want to use, then check “Always open in * view” at the top of the display settings inspector panel. This will save all the defaults.
