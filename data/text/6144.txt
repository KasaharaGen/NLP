Q: Symlinked services in ~/Library/Services not working in Lion Does anyone know how to make symlinked services work in Lion? I used to keep all my services under version control in SL and symlinked into ~/Library/Services and this stopped working when I installed Lion. Once I 'installed' the services they work but even after they installed replacing them with the symlink doesn't work.
Anyone have any ideas to get this working? Or know why it no longer works?
I am using soft links if that makes a difference.

A: I would hard link a file to make sure it's disabled by design.
You could then decide to go that path or come up with automation to deploy changes to production - something simple like make or rsync or complicated like Puppet.
