A: According to Apple documentation, you can either use eject and F12 as mentioned before, or keep your mouse button pressed.
If you keep option pressed during boot, it should ask you from what disk you want to boot. That might be a better solution.
Are you sure this is the issue though?

A: Did you try to press the eject button while booting ?
Just after you press the power button, press and hold Eject.
