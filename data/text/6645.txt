Q: How to enforce backup of an .ipa from iPad to iTunes/Mac? Usually, all the .ipas are backup up in the ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications folder. I accidentally deleted an .ipa in the folder. Now, after syncing, the app is on iPad but the .ipa is not backup in the Mobile Applications folder. How can I enforce the sync to backup all .ipas to the Mac again?
My iPad is not jailbreak. I want to restore the VLC app (.ipa deleted from Mac) from iPad and install on another new iPhone ...

A: File - Transfer purchases from "device" command in the iTunes menu is intended to move all apps as well as any other purchased content to an iTunes library that lacks those items.

A: Just download it again from iTunes, at no extra charge.
