While in beta, we, Apple Developers with access to the developer portal, are prohibited to say anything regarding the beta iOS.


A: There's a good breakdown of new features over on iLounge
In summary;
Apple TV  


*

*AirPlay improvements (stream some web videos and your own videos)

*iOS Software Number matches other iOS devices

*New On-Screen Keyboard Design


There don't appear to be any changes to Netflix but there's always a chance it'll appear in the final release.  You might have to wait for iOS 5
