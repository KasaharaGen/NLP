Q: How to check whether the Mac OS X installation DVD I have is for my MacBook Pro? I just tried to reinstall OS X on my 13" MacBook Pro with the installation DVD that I have (OS is Snow Leopard, I bought around 2010). I followed all the reinstallation steps correctly, but what I got is a "Mac OS X cannot be installed on this computer" error. I read lots of forums post about the solutions and tried everything, but nothing works. I tried zeroing the partition several times with GUI partition scheme, did PRAM/NVRAM reset. Nothing works.
So there's only one scenario I need to check which is whether the Mac OS X installation DVD that I have is for my MacBook Pro. Can anyone please kindly point out to me how I can check whether the disc is the correct one for my MacBook Pro?

A: It says so right on the disk.

Please don't pirate OS X.
