Q: iPhone/iPad alarm clock app with custom radio stream support Is there a iPhone (or even better iPad) alarm clock app that will play a radio stream of my choosing to wake me up?
With custom stream I mean the possibility to enter a custom URL to a .pls file, and that pls contains a URL to a mp3.
Something like TimeTurner but with the custom stream support.

A: TuneIn Radio. I've not looked back since.

A: Radio Alarm is a great iPhone app that works well with custom streams (.pls file that points to a MP3) and has a lot of well working alarm features.

A: Tunemark Radio is a iPad/iPhone app that support custom streams (.pls file that points to a MP3), but isn't really written to work as a alarm clock so has poor alarm features.

A: Update 2016 (post iOS 8.0):
Bedr radio alarm clock, which is able to run in a background state.
