Q: Signals sent to command-line programs when exiting terminal.app When using tmux, if I CMD-W, or otherwise quite out of terminal, my tmux session persists, as it should.  However, it still lists itself as "attached", whereas on other platforms, (e.g. Ubuntu) when the terminal exits it must signal tmux in some way that it has detached.  (Also works when logged in through ssh and I kill ssh; tmux notices that the terminal connection has detached)
Is there some way to debug this?  I'd like to see what signals terminal.app sends, and compare them with the signals sent on other OS's.
