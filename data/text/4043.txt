Q: What's the best way to use IRC on the mac? Question in the title basically. Not sure what else I can say!

A: The most popular IRC client on the Mac platform is undoubtedly Colloquy (free).  It has a sleek interface and is extremely configurable.

A: Colloquy is nice, but I think X-Chat has always been much, much better. http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11070/x-chat-azure
