Q: TV Style remote that can be mapped to keypresses For a project I'm working on I need to get people to interact with a mac using a TV Style Remote.
I want to map some of the buttons (Left, Right, Up, Down, Red, Yellow, Green, Blue and Select) to simulate keypresses.
Can anyone point me in the direction of something that might be suitable for a machine running Snow Leopard. I've seen several solutions targeting at Windows MCE but none of them have had Mac support.
The standard apple remote, or an iPod/iPad remote app aren't suitable for this project.

A: I've just found Remote Buddy from http://www.iospirit.com/
It looks like it will do what I'm looking for and works with a wide range of hardware.
I'll try to pick up a compatible remote and see how I get on.
