Q: Real tracking app for iPhone? Is there an app that can tell me someone else's exact or general location by entering their phone number, no matter if they give permission or not? (Preferably not.) Or is there some other device, software, etc. that I can purchase? Something that is real and not just for entertainment purposes.

A: Not on the App Store. Something like this is a likely violation of privacy laws as well. There's no way Apple would allow it.

A: The only functionality that you'll find for a non-jailbroken iPhone is the Mobile Me Find My iPhone service.  For Jailbroken iPhones there's Navimote, Undercover Mobile, and quite a few others.
