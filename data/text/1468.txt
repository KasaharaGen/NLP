Q: Connect to Express over Extreme I have an Airport Extreme as my main router in my house and have recently bought an Airport Express to use as an extender.
This is all now set up and working fine, with the Express bouncing on the internet connection for me to use throughout the house. However sometimes my phone will connect to the Express instead of the Extreme, although the Extreme is closer. Is there a way to selectively choose which router to connect to? The problem is that there is a limit to the number of devices that can connect to the Express, and this limit is being reached every now and then.

A: One way of doing this (like they said in the comments) would be to enable allowed Access control and specifying which devices are allowed to access the express. This is an easy solution if your device's are not going to change a lot :)
