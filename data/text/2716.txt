Q: How can I control an app on my iOS device from Mac or PC I would like to take control of my app on an iOS device (mostly an iPhone) from my MacBook Pro or Windows, doesn't matter which one.
I know that it can be accomplished via Veency, and that's exactly what I need - but I do NOT want to jailbreak my iPhone.
Is there a similar legal alternative?
If not - is it something I could develop perhaps, or will I run into some SDK limitations for such a thing?

A: All iOS SDK apps work within a security sandbox, and thus have no access or control over any other apps (with a few tiny exceptions for registered URLs). You could take control of you own app, but no others, including Apple's, on a stock OS device.

A: I found solution using TeamViewer QuickSupport. Install quicksupport for ios on iphone and connect using teamviewer.
I can't test, it requires ios11.

A: Turn on Home Sharing using Remote
1.Connect iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to a Wi-Fi network on the same local network as your Mac, PC, or Apple TV.


*Open the Remote app on your iOS device.

*Turn on Home Sharing from the Remote Settings screen.

*Sign in to the same Apple ID you used on your other devices.
