Q: Mac OS X Wireless Keyboard Power Button I have done everything to trouble shoot my non-working keyboard. I've been using it a year and it is set up correctly There is supposed to be a power button? I sure can't find it!
Thanx!

A: The power button is on the right hand side, it's part of the "tube" at the back and clearly marked with a power button symbol.

I resolved this by rolling some soft household metal sponge [...] into a small ball and dropping it

  touch the casing, this could cause a shortcircuit.
