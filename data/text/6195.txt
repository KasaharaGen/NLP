Q: Mail.app on Lion with Exchange doesn't get updates I've noticed since upgrading to Lion that Mail.app doesn't seem to update the mailbox and synchronize properly with Exchange.
Before on SL, or using Outlook now, they always maintained correct state, matching with my iPhone, or webmail. Now, it seems that Lion gets lost. I have to force a sync, open and shut it, or change folders to get it to resync that folder contents.
Is this just me, or is this a known issue?
Is there a work around?
Thanks.

A: Try the rebuild utility through the app, I had a very similar problem and this resolved it for me. Best of luck.

A: 1) Run the following in Terminal.app:
sqlite3 ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Envelope\ Index vacuum
2) And then select your Inbox, and select Mailbox->rebuild.
Worked for me :)

A: There is a partial work around for this:
Delete (or copy to somewhere else) this file:  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist
That stores your preferences for Mail.app, after deleting it you will loose your preferences with the exception of your mail accounts.
This worked for me but a couple of months later the bug came back and I had to delete the file again.
