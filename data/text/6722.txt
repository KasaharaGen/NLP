Q: Does Time Machine make a backup of Windows if using Boot Camp? I'm using Windows 7 on my Mac. On the Lion OS I installed Time Machine to keep a backup of my Laptop. Does this backup also cover the Windows partition?

A: No, Time Machine does not do this. The only reliable way to back up your BootCamp partition is to boot into Windows and run Windows-compatible disk backup software from within Windows, to back up to a separate external hard drive formatted with NTFS.
Winclone has not been updated in a long time and is not a useful solution.

A: As far as I know, it won't.
Check out Winclone.
