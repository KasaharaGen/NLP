Q: How do I get rid of the sub headings in finder with "arrange be date created" in Lion So I installed Lion and I can't stand the way finder arranges icons arrange by date. Finder makes a bunch of sub headings like: today, yesterday, past 30 days or earlier. These settings have a show all button/coverflow thing. Is there a way to get rid of the headings? Thanks.

A: There's a new toolbar button in Finder, called Arrange. If you choose to arrange by anything in that menu, you'll get the new headings that you've described. To disable this sorting and get the standard click-to-sort column headers back, click the Arrange button, and set it to "None."
