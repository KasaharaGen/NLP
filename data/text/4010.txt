Q: Burning Data+Audio Disc It's been a long time since I've ever had to burn something that isn't just a set of data, or an ISO (via Disk Utility), but now I have to burn a Multi-Session disc.
Are there easy ways of burning a data ISO first, followed by MP3s (as standard Redbook Audio tracks), other than paying $80 for Roxio's Toast burning software?

A: While these instructions on Apple's website (Apple support doc) are for OS X 10.4, they still work in Snow Leopard.  It has been a very long time since I had to do a multi-session CD, but I remember doing this way or in a very similar way. It's worth a try and a CD-R costs a lot less that Toast.

A: I have solved this need by using Burn. Drop dead simple burning and quite a few worthwhile features.
(Not to be confused with Buuurn!)
