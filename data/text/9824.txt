Q: How do I use my Logitech G9x mouse on Mac OS X Lion? I've got Logitech G9x mouse. Gaming mouse. Great mouse. 
Logitech doesn't support it under MacOS X. 
Mouse works perfectly (as far as I can see ) with standard Mac OS driver. (ie right/left/middle buttons and scroll works. What doesn't work are thumb buttons. I've got used to them to go back/forward while browsing, etc. 
Couple options I've tried, none helped.


*

*Logitech Control Center (LCC v.3.5.1-28) - did not recognize mouse. Expected.

*USB Overdrive - no support for OS X Lion with repots on kernel crashes from users of OS X Lion. didn't try, as it's not stable solution. 

*Steer Mouse didn't recognize G9x on Mac. But did recognize couple other mices I had (ie mx revolution, vx revolution)


Option left: Write own driver. How? 
Did I miss anything? Any other drivers out there, I didn't find? (I found a lot of enhancers for magic mouse, or whatever it's called)

A: Use Better touch tool. Freeware. You can assign macros to any button with this wonderful tool.
