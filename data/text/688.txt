Q: What is the best key remapper tool? I use international keyboards which have ` (~ with shift) next to Z key. I'm used to having `/~ key next to 1 (currently, this key produces § or ± with shift, which I don't use at all). My goal is to remap §/± key to `/~.
I have found several key remapping tools for Mac OS, so I want to ask which one do you have best experience with. (I use Mac OS X 10.6)

A: great question... I've been looking for a tool that will allow me to emulate TouchCursor for Windows on the mac for a long time.  Tried Ukelele, DoubleCommand, and some others that I can't remember right now :)  KeyRemap4Macbook seemed to be closest to what I needed, but I could never get around to configuring it how I wanted it.  Your mileage may vary.
Check out this page that gives some of the aforementioned programs and start playing :)

A: Ukelele
