Q: What file systems can Snow Leopard read? I just got a MacBook Pro for my parents, and I need to get their files from a Linux desktop machine that most likely has either reiserfs or ext3 file systems.
I would like to know if Snow Leopard can read these files if I put the HDD in an external HDD case??
Thanks

A: It might be easier to connect the machines on a network and use rsync, nfs or ftp   to copy data, no extra software would be needed.
If you want to do this you will need MacFuse which allows OS X to read other file systems. A tutorial for ext3 is on this blog.

A: If you are planning on doing this a lot, there are commecial packages too:

There is a free alternatives also though through MacFuse/FUSE:

A: Mac OS X can read (but not necessarily write):


*

*HFS+ (Mac OS X default format, in plain, journaled, case-sensitive, or journaled/case-sensitive varieties)

*NTFS (but not write, by default)

*FAT (32 and 64 as seen in Christian Correa's comment)


I would expect it can read but I haven't tested it:


*

*HFS (the older Mac OS file system [Hierarchical File System])

*UFS (Unix File System; older versions of OS X could format and be installed on UFS partitions)


I know for a fact that OS X will not read:


*

*ReiserFS

*ext* (any of the various versions of the ext Linux file system)

*just about anything else


Check out the Mac OS X column at the incredibly complete Wikipedia article comparing file systems.

A: Disk Utility can format a new hard drive using the following formats: 


*

*Mac OS X format

*Mac OS X format (Journaled)

*FAT32 (MS-DOS)

*FAT64, also known as exFAT


I believe those would be the same file systems that the operating system can read.
