Q: install windows 7 32-bit using boot-camp on snow-leopard I have Snow-Leopard running on my MacBook. I want to install Windows 7 32-bit Professional. I have already purchased copy of Windows from Amazon. I never'ed install Windows on my MacBook till date, so I don't know what to do, and how to install it.
Please share your experiences of installing Windows using Boot-Camp.
I need screen-shots or video that can help me with installation.
