Q: What to do with broken iPhone 3G? A friend order an iPhone 4 to replace his iPhone 3G which has a cracked screen. He offered it to me. 
I have AT&T on a family plan with no text or data. What should I do with the phone?
I'm open to suggestions, but I'm considering...


*

*fixing the screen and then selling it. I'd put that money towards purchasing the iPhone 4 with a data plan.

*fixing the screen and keeping it.

*selling without fixing the screen.


I guess I could keep it without fixing the screen too, but...

A: You can buy very cheap screen replacements on ebay (about AU$30). I have fitted one of these myself, it is not too hard.

A: I sold mine without fixing it and got a nice price on ebay.

A: use it as a External HardDrive.
