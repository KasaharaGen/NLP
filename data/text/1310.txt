Q: How can I type Chinese on MacBook Pro? I would like to know how to type Chinese (simplified), using Pinyin, on my MacBook Pro. 
I went to System Preference > Language & Text > Language, moved Chinese (simplified) on the list right after English, and then under the Input Sources tab, I check Chinese simplified and English. 
After all these steps, I still have no clue how to type Chinese. (When I open TextEdit, I don't see any language selection.)

A: After select pinyin in your input language you can open any editor like textEdit:

when you start typing you see the box (like below box) and can select your desire word.


A: For this and other useful info, there's a whole site:
