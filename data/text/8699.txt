Q: Alternative to iTunes Album Art I'm looking for an alternative to iTunes' Album Art. I liked it so far but since the upgrade to Lion / latest iTunes I see some annoying bugs.
To be worth considering, the alternative I'm looking for must have at least these three features:


*

*Automatic lyrics download and saving in the ID3 tag;

*Automatic cover download (iTunes is confused when the album title is missing);

*Display cover/title/artist on the desktop.


Any suggestions?

A: For the lyrics part, I would recommend Get Lyrical. It can actively tag songs, tag specific songs, or tag a playlist. It gets all of its lyrics from Lyrics Wiki. This is a great little application and I highly recommend it. It has a simple, clean interface that is really easy to use:


A: Have you tried Corripio Artwork Finder or Album Art Thingy ?  They do cover art and lyrics.

A: There is www.itunescovers.com, export your iTunes library as XML file and upload it there, they find almost every CD cover available!

A: Tagalicious is a paid for app that:


*

*Works seeminglessly with iTunes.

*Finds Album Art & Song Lyrics

*Organises your music with the right information & tags


It maybe expensive, but it may also be worth it where other apps have let you down in the past.
