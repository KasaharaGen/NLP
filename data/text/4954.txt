Q: How to control apache service on OS X (start/stop/restart/graceful restart)? I have Apache installed on OS X and I want to know what command I can use to:


*

*start apache

*stop apache

*restart apache

*gracefully restart apache


Also I want to know if the commands were successful or not.
Apache seams to be installed as org.apache.httpd or at least this is what sudo launchctl list|grep apache shows.

A: I use the apachectl command
sudo apachectl stop
sudo apachectl start
sudo apachectl restart
sudo apachectl -k graceful

Hope this helps
