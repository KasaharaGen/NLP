Q: What is the wattage of the speakers in a 2011 MacBook Air? I have recently purchased a MacBook Air and the speakers sound tiny. Does anyone know how many watts the speakers in the 2011 Macbook Airs have?

A: The simple answer is - not many.
The iFixit teardown of an earlier model (mid-2010) suggests 1-2 watts. The teardown of the 2011 model says nothing has changed since then.
