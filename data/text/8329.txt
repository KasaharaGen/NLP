Q: Is there an app to ping IP's periodically to check latency? I'm sure I came across a really nice app that would ping a list of sites or IP addresses every x mins/hours and send alerts when it could not ping.
But I can't find the app back, anyone know of any good ones?

A: How about a web service that will do this for you?
Check out host-tracker.com.  It will ping an IP address (or http-get or traceroute) for you from a collection of sensor sites.  It looks like it will email you error notifications.
I haven't used the site, so can't speak to how well it works.


A: I'm not sure if this sends alerts, but it can monitor up to 250 IP addresses at whatever interval you like.  It can display the host, status (as green/yellow/red) and ping time.  
On the app store for $1.99:
