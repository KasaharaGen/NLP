Q: iCloud: How can I create a calendar event for next 3 days for a specific time? Is there a quick way to make calendar events for 3 days in a row for like 8am to 4pm without having to make 3 seperate events?
Eg.  Make event for 8am to 4pm and repeat for next 3 days ONLY.
Can't see anyway of doing this using the iPhone interface or the iCloud interface.

A: Create an Event, and then select "Repeat => Every Day" and click "Done" - you'll now see a new option below "Repeat" called "End Repeat" where you then choose e.g. a date 3 days from today.



A: Create a new event in iOS 5 Calender and select "Repeat":

Set repeat to "Daily" and go back to "Add Event" dialog. Now you can select either an end date for the repetition or set it to "forever":
