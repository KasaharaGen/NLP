Q: How to contact Apple about connection issue on bugreport.apple.com? I have been trying to log into their bug reporter system (bugreport.apple.com) for about a month. 
Every time I log in, I get redirected to an error page, which tell me to report the problem. The thing is, I have reported the problem through the email-address they provided in the error page and also through the "Report Login Issue"-link at the login page. 
I have only received an automated message, which tell me they received the message and I haven't got any other update (and I still can't log in).
I have waited almost a month, what should I do?
Here's a screenshot of the error I get when I log in:


A: I tried connecting with Safari (6.0.2), and it wasn't working:

When using Chrome (versions 15 & 25), I am asked to sign-in using my Apple ID on this page: http://bugreport.apple.com/ 
I have no problem at all: 

Make sure you are using the latest update of your browser. Or use a different one such as Opera, Firefox, etc.
Take note of this, from the page, where you enter your Apple ID credentials:

Note: Safari is the suggested browser for use of the Bug Reporter.
  JavaScript and Cookies must be enabled to access the Bug Reporter.
  Idle time to disconnect is 120 minutes.

If you have tried with different browsers, and it still doesn't work. I suggest you try repairing disk permissions in your disk utility, if you are on a Mac.
If it still does not work, try downloading the newest Safari, and reinstall it. You can also try this link to the login-page.

A: Have you tried the form on this page: Bug Reporter Connection Problems - Apple Developer?
