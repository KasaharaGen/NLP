Q: How to increase font size of Eclipse globally? I'd like to know how to increase the font size for Eclipse so it adjusts the whole GUI to not look so darn small on my screen.
For NetBeans there is the --font-size switch which can be set in netbeans.conf, is there something similar for Eclipse?
(In case it's useful, I'm on Snow Leopard.)

A: Solution for Eclipse Oxygen at MacOS High Sierra (Dec 2017)


*

*Open terminal and run commands:
cd /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.2.1.v20170809-1435/css

vim e4_basestyle.css


*Add a style:
* {
    font-size: 14;
}


*Restart Eclipse to apply changes.

A: As far as I know, there's no way to increase the font globally. In Eclipse's Preferences, navigate to General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts.
Dialog font is the font used in the dialogs, and Text Font used in text editors, etc.
I don't know how to increase the font for the rest of the GUI, though.

A: Go to Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts, expand the "Basic" folder and select "Text Font" and change that to whatever size you like. 
For Eclipse Neon:
To Increase Ctrl +
To reduce Ctrl -
for Macs, use the command key, not the control key


A: For eclipse luna :
edit
eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.0.1.v20141126-1957/css/e4_default_gtk.css
and add at end of file :
* {
  font-size:14;
} 

This will make eclipse keep same font if you switch workspaces

A: Inside the Eclipse.app is a setting for the font size. To make the fonts globally larger edit Eclipse.app » Contents » Eclipse » eclipse.ini and remove the line 
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts
from the file. Save the file and restart Eclipse.

A: I have Eclipse installed in a Linux machine. A while ago I did a Linux update and it messed up the fonts on the entire system. All the fonts got larger. So, I went all over the place resizing the fonts for each application.
Guess what?! On the next Linux update, the fonts got back to normal. However, I had to go back and undo all the font resizing that I had previously done on every application. So, when it came time to reset the fonts in Eclipse, I couldn't remember exactly what I did. I went to the following location:
Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Basic > Text Font > Edit

No matter what I did on this setting, the font remained the same.
I finally figured out what the problem was. I had also resized the fonts on the following location:
Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Structured Text Editors > Structured Text Editor Text Font (overrides default: Text Font) > Edit

Once I edited this setting, the fonts on Eclipse went back to normal.

A: NOTE: For those coming from Google, this change has no effect on later MacOS/Eclipse versions of El Capitan and Mars, respectively. See this related question: Yosemite: How do increase font size of Eclipse globally?

A: You go to colors and font and go to the java drop down and find java editor and edit the size and it should work as it has for me.

A: eclipse on Mac, for the font in the tools bar, you have to go to the system preference->display->resolution, and change the system font.

A: window --> preference-->general-->apperance-->colors and fonts-->basic -->text font

A: Menu: window -> editor -> zoom in/out
