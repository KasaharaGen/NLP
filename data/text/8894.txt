Q: How to put MacBook Pro to sleep when the lid is closed and you remove the power? I think I have a common use case that is not properly handle by Lion.
If I close the lid and remove the power supply, my macbook is not going to sleep mode and stays awake draining the battery. It's like having the Caffeine active.
In fact, I do have Caffeine started but it is inactive.
This happens quite regularly, do you know a solution for this?
