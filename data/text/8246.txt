Q: How can I sync Reading List with Windows? Is it possible to use Safari's Reading List on my Windows machine and have it synced with the one on my Mac/iOS devices?

A: According to Apple's support docs, Safari 5.1.1 for Windows will sync the Reading List via iCloud. 

Safari 5.1.1 includes support for iCloud, a breakthrough set of free cloud services. iCloud stores your Safari bookmarks and Safari Reading List and automatically pushes them to all your devices.

I believe you would need to have Safari up to date. Then, install the iCloud Windows control panel and configure it to sync Safari content. 

Then, enable iCloud on all of your Mac/iOS devices, and you should be good to go.
