Q: Lion - customize toolbar In Snow Leopard you could right click an application toolbar icon and select "Remove item", this is no longer possible in Lion. If I select "Customize toolbar" I get the customization panel, but it's not possible to do any changes.
Anyone know if this is a bug or intentional?
Any way around it?

A: âŒ˜CMD-drag to get the item out of the toolbar.

A: Have you tried, when in Customize Toolbar, to drag the items out of the actual toolbar? It works for me in Safari.
