Q: Finding iPad games that can be played over the internet What is the best way to find new iPad games that can be played over the internet? (Not splitscreen, not bluetooth, not WiFi, only the ones that can be played over larger distances)
(I know there are a lot of game review sites out there, but none of them seems to have the filter options I need.) The answer could be a set of search terms I could use, or a review site, but I'm looking for a source to find these games.

A: Go to Game Center.
Select the Games section.
You will see the "Find More Games" button there.
Or open App Store>Games>Game Center to see a list of Internet based multiplayer games.
