Q: Keyboard shortcut to sleep a Mac I am looking for a quick way to sleep without closing the lid, or using the mouse.
If it matters, I have Lion version OS and a MacBook Air. 

A: Press the power button, then S.
As described in this thread:
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3273071?start=0&tstart=0
The power button displays the Sleep/Restart/Shutdown dialog.  If you then press S the Mac will sleep.

A: Keyboard shortcut is Option+Cmd+Eject (the Eject key is at your keyboard upper right corner).

A: Keyboard Shortcut

Sleep Mac while it is running


A: I was totally happy using Karabiner but:

Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment.

I got bored of waiting so I solved by myself. 
What I need? 
I need a command line to sleep mac, and this is pretty easy:
pmset sleepnow 

Who can I run the script? This is more boring, but not complicated:


*

*open automator and create a new service





*

*select 'run shell script' and write the above command 





*

*save with name "sleepService" and your are in!


Now the easy part: open System Preferences->Keyboard and type your custom shortcut!


A: If others do have a keyboard with an eject key, you can just press Command ⌘+Option ⌥+Eject ⏏.
Other shortcuts:
Control ^+Shift ⇧+Eject ⏏ - Put displays to sleep
Command ⌘+Control ^+Eject ⏏ - Restart
Command ⌘+Control ^+Option ⌥+Eject ⏏ - Shut down
If others like the OP have a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a power key in place of an eject key, substituting the power key for eject should work in Mountain Lion and later versions of OS X, but not in Lion.
Since Mavericks, another option is to just press the power button or power key. It now puts a Mac to sleep instead of showing a dialog with different options.
If you don't have a keyboard with an eject or power key, you can use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <item>
    <name>test</name>
    <identifier>test</identifier>
    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::S, VK_CONTROL, VK_OPTION, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>
 </item>
</root>

Or create a workflow like this in Alfred:


A: You can assign any unused key combination (like fn⌘⌥F12) using System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Application Shortcuts
Click the + button, then under Application, leave All Applications, under Menu Title enter Sleep, and under Keyboard Shortcut, press fn⌘⌥F12.
Note: For the step "under Menu Title enter Sleep", the Sleep is according to your language. For example, under Traditional Chinese, you should enter 睡眠.

Another option, if you're more Terminal-inclined:

*

*⌘space

*Type Terminal

*push Enter

*Type sudo shutdown -s now

A: Press the power button. Assuming you haven't reconfigured its behaviour, it should pop up a dialog with options to Sleep, Restart, or Shutdown the laptop. The "Reopen windows when logging back in" checkbox has keyboard focus by default; hitting the Tab key twice will put focus on the Sleep button - hitting the Space bar will then put the MacBook Air to sleep.
(Note that hitting Return will activate the dialog's default action - namely, to shut the computer down.)
Not as quick as a single keyboard shortcut, but faster than the mouse and without closing the lid. :)

A: For everyone without a mac keyboard, I advice you to install Karabiner.  
Once opened, you can go under "Change Key" tab and search for sleep:

With this option checked, now you can:


*

*prompt restart/sleep/shutdown dialog: CtrlAltDel

*force immediately sleep: ShiftCtrlAltDel

A: Add below to karabiner complex modifications. You may adjust the shortcuts as you wish. They map to the original mac shortcuts for sleep screen and sleep computer. 
Currently it is ctrl + option + command + button prior to 1 on keyboard (grave_accent_and_tilde)
Other is ctrl + option ... you know the rest.

                        }
                }

        ]
},


A: Using Karabiner (previously named KeyRemap4MacBook), you can remap your F19 key (or any other F key for that matter) to make the computer sleep using the following private.xml:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <item>
    <name>F19 to Sleep</name>
    <identifier>Sleep</identifier>
    <autogen>
        __KeyToKey__
        KeyCode::F19,
        KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L
    </autogen>
 </item>
</root>

To use a different F key, simply change all occurrences of F19 to something else.
F19 works best for me since it's at the top right edge of the full-size wired Apple keyboard, making it hard to hit it by mistake and easy to find in the dark.
