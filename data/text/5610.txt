A: Additionally, if you hold "Option" while in the Finder's Go menu, it'll add a Library entry. Useful to know how to get there if you don't need constant access.

A: chflags nohidden ~/Library

If you just need to browse into it on someone else's computer, open a Finder window, press cmd+shift+g and then type ~/Library.
