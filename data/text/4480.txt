Q: Change Account Password to Blank I recently changed an account password by accident, and was wondering how to set it back to a blank password via the shell. I have root privileges. Please help :)
passwd USER doesn't accept blank passwords

A: The passwd command rejects the idea that you can have a 0 length password. 
Instead use dscl which is more accepting of the notion that the password is nothing.
dscl . -passwd /Users/foo

You can press enter to make the new password blank and then may get an error and have to enter the old password if you are not root
Once you authenticate (or are root already) the blank password will be set for the account in question. 

A: You can set the account password to no password using the Users and Groups Pane in System Preferences.

A: macOS no longer allows this using the System Preferences and this is why.
macOS and iOS turn on sharing of all your photos by default so that Apple can keep all the photos of billions of people on their servers.
Additionally they by default turn on iCloud end-to-end encryption for some specific things on your devices and that end-to-end encryption is secured using your local device login password.
Apple wants you to store all your life on Apple servers and they cannot do that if you do not have a local device password. So that is why you are not able to NOT set a password.
