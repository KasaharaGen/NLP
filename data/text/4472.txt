Q: How to increase "tracking speed" beyond the maximum? For a Macbook Pro, I've set trackpad settings for Three Fingers to "Dragging":

However the tracking speed is too slow, and often it's impossible to drag for a larger distance due to the size of the physical trackpad.
How do we increase the tracking speed beyond the maximum allowed?

A: The value of the preference is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist and can be changed with something like defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 5.0. The normal maximum value is currently 3.0. Applying the changes requires logging out and back in.

A: Mouse Curves is a preference pane that allows you to customize the tracking speed of the mouse and trackpad.

A: For those who come here searching for mouse speed up (as me), change the command/property mentioned on the answer of @user495470 to com.apple.mouse.scaling. 
So:
defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 5.0

is what you're looking for.

A: BetterTouchTool does that, and lets you add application specific gestures as well!
In BetterTouchTool, open Preferences. In the left bar under Advanced Settings choose either Trackpad or Magic Mouse. There is a slider that adjusts the tracking speed.
I don't think I could use a mac without it, at this point. I have my browser-tab-management and finder shortcuts mapped to multitouch gestures.

A: Ordinary trackpad-dragging can be done in segments, the same way mouse-dragging can be done in limited space, by lifting & repositioning {the mouse; your fingers} and making another swipe.  In your prefpane, enable one-finger click and drag, and you won't even need to press down.

A: As mentioned before, the file is in ~/Library/Preferences/.
But preferences will be found in more than one file.
.GlobalPreferences.plist
com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist
com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist
com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist
Note that .GlobalPreferences.plist is invisible.
Mouse speed is called scaling in .GlobalPreferences.plist.
Setting scaling past 3 with defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling 5 has no effect immediately and may require a logout.
file://~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist
file://~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist
file://~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist

A: If you turn inertial scrolling on, you can, once you've started a drag gesture, keep two fingers steady and flick with the other one to inertially "drag" the window around your screen(s).
