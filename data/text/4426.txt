Q: iTunes freeze when on podcasts tab I have a problem with the latest itunes 10.2  When I hit itunes podcast tab it freezes. I found a workaround by creating new library, but it's annoying that every time I had to recreate my library to just got freeze again in new library.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this?

A: I found a possible workaround myself. Firstly cut off internet connection of your computer, then open iTunes, hit Podcasts tab, then iTunes will hang for a while but not complete freeze, delete suspected podcasts that may cause freeze, lastly reestablish internet connection.

A: Look a this answer. The two problems are oddly similar, even though it's not the same app.

A: Switch to "List" instead of "Unplayed, my podcasts and my stations".
