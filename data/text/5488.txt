Q: “Show Help Menu” keyboard shortcut & full screen apps in OS X 10.7 if you press cmd + shift + / focus moves to the search field in the help menu of the current application. This seems to be broken when the frontmost app is in full screen mode in 10.7. 
Is there a workaround to this?

A: Great catch! It's certainly a bug from where I sit.
I filed a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com on this - feel free to do the same if you want it to have more attention!
I can't think of a way to work around it even using something like FastScripts to try and intercept the key press before it gets ignored.
