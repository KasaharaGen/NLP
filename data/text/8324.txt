Q: Compiling git on Lion gets warnings about SHA1_Init is deprecated; what is the replacement? I compiled Git 1.7.7 from source and while doing so, got warnings about SHA1_Init and other related functions being deprecated on MacOS X 10.7 (I'm using 10.7.2 and although I have XCode 4.2, I am compiling with a home-built GCC 4.6.1, but that only changes details in the warning messages).
The header is /usr/include/openssl/sha.h; it contains notices such as:
int SHA_Init(SHA_CTX *c) DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_7_AND_LATER;



*

*Does anyone know where it is documented why SHA1 is deprecated by Apple and what the proposed replacement is?

Grumble: I can't yet create new tags 'sha1', 'openssl' and 'deprecated' which I consider might be appropriate.
