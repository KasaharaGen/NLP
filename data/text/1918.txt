Q: How do split panes in Terminal work? I tried to open a split pane to run another command but instead it displays the same in both panes and I can only interact with one of them. I thought it would split the view so I could use the two panes independently like two windows.
I have the Visor installed but I don't think it would interfere.
Terminal - version 2.1.1
Visor custom (84d1873) based on 1.5


A: It's meant to be like that. See this Super User answer:

You're misinterpreting the feature. It's not meant for two separate
  terminals. It's intended to allow a
  user to see two different view points
  in the same terminal. For instance, if
  you have 3000 files in a directory,
  and you perform an ls command, that
  output is going to be very long.
If you use the split pane, you can
  scroll through that long output
  without having to flip back and forth,
  possibly losing your place along the
  way.
If you want two terminals, use tabs,
  or separate windows.

I would add that, for two separate terminals, you can use separate tabs as well.

A: You should really have a look at screen (thatÂ´s an already installed command line tool, not a separate application), which gives you the ability to split your Terminal into two (or more) separate ones. I use that with Visor and it works like a charm. Have a look around here, there are quite a few tips on how to use "screen" on a Mac.

A: Also don't over look tmux. Its like screen but more features I believe.

A: iTerm 2 supports split panes with independent shells in each pane, not one linked shell.
