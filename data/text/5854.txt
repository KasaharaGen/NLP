Q: Is it possible to switch between spaces with Command+Number in Lion? In Snow Leopard I could switch spaces by pressing âŒ˜+Number. Is there a way to turn that on in Lion?

A: Yes you can. Just changes the shortcut setting in the System Preferences>Keyboard>Keyboard Shortcut. You will find Mission Control section for shortcut, and there is entry called Switch to Desktop.
You could define your own shortcut here.
