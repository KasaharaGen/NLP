Q: Do MacBook Pros have support for the Remote Control? Do the new (2011) MacBook Pros work with Apple's Remote Control?
I'm little confused because the Apple Store offers me an Apple Remote when I try buying a new MacBook Pro, but I don't see any information about support for that remote in the MacBook Pro's description.

A: From the Manual for the 13inch, here is a picture that shows you where the IR port is located.


A: Yes it does support it. You can verify this information because when you go to the apple store and select a new model, one of the accesories you can add to your purchase is the apple remote. They wouldn't add that if you couldn't use it :)
I assume the IrDA port is there @ the front of the machine, possible hard to see in the official pictures. 

A: Yes it does. If you have the dock which supports it try not to put them close as it's the closest IR connection to you that picks it up!
