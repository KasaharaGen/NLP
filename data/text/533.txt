Q: iPhone/iPod Touch App Review Sites and Payola Some of the iPhone/iPod Touch app review sites require developers to pay them to have a review posted. This raises obvious concerns about the independence and objectivity of the reviews.  (See this Wired article for more information.) Requiring payment for product reviews is not illegal, so the only way to turn back this trend is for consumers to ignore these sorts of reviews.
So, I would like to have a list of app review sites, along with a note as to whether they charge for reviews, or have any other conflicts of interest.  Vote up the ones that you find most useful.
If you are a developer who has been asked to pay a fee by one of these sites, please provide details.
I want to keep this list focused on apps for iPhone and iPod Touch.  If you want to list review sites for other devices, please create another question.

A: TheiPhoneAppReview.com and AppCraver.com are mentioned by the Wired article as sites that ask programmers to pay fees.
