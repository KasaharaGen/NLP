Q: iPhone 3GS, ATT MicroCell, iOS 4.0.1, failure to connect I was a very happy customer of my microcell until the upgrade to 4.0 and the subsequent patch. Now, at best, I can force an M-cell connection by flipping to airplane and back. I have completely reinitialized the M-cell. Is there way way around this except to whine to AT&T and wait for someone to fix something?

A: Try resetting your network settings. Many iPhone connectivity issues can be resolved with that.

A: I have had 3 MicroCells from ATT. The first lasted 29 days and then could not be re-synced, the second lasted 6 days and could not be re-synced. The third could not be re-synced from the outset. I finally took it back for credit. The serial numbers for all three were close enough together to be from the same manufacturing batch. I believe there is a component failre -- of the infant mortality variety -- in the cell circuit. In all three the GPS sync was not a problem.

A: Most recent advice from AT&T for iPhone 4 (assuming 3G, 3Gs, and 4Gs) and MicroCell connectivity.  


*

*Unplug MicroCell for 30 seconds.  

*Plug it back in.

*Turn off iPhone for 30 seconds.

*Turn it back on.

*Reset Network Settings on iPhone.  (Under Settings -> General -> Reset Network Setting)  This will cycle the iPhone (turn it on and off automatically)  WARNING:  Resetting this will require you to rejoin your network (if wireless) and to re-enter your password for the network.  Make sure you have it before you do this!!!

*Wait until Friday when AT&T will call me back and explain why the iPhone won't force connect to the MicroCell when I get back to my house.  Or when a random 1 bar of edge network signal is picked up and permanently disconnects it.
At the end of the day, the only success I've had is putting your phone into Airplane mode for a second and then turning Airplane mode off.
Take it or leave it, this is the best I've got right now.
