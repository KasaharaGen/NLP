Q: iTunes Utility - Merging Libraries I would like to merge three separate iTunes libraries.  Here is more information:


*

*Currently have 3 separate iTunes libraries on 2 laptops and and dekstop.

*Want to merge all three onto the desktop (i.e. it has all content), while maintaining the other two laptop based libraries as-is.

*I want to avoid getting a slew of duplicates within the merged library.

*I am not concerned about maintaining the library (i.e. playlists, etc.) on desktop.

*I am not concerned with maintaining perfect sync, so could repeat the necessary procedure periodically to remerge libraries.


I am ok with using the command line, Python or applescript if that's the way to go.

A: You can sync libraries one-way with rsync:
rsync -av --force --delete --size-only ~/Music/iTunes /Volumes/johndoe/Music

A detailed writeup is here: Keeping 2 iTunes Libraries in Sync
I actually use this technique myself.
Creates a "carbon copy" of a library on another machine which you can then sync to reflect changes.
Works best with two Macs, never tried it with a PC.
