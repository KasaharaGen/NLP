Q: Editing Hosts File to Redirect URL to different IP Address When I edit my hosts file to redirect a URL to a specific IP address, nothing happens.  My hosts file looks like this - 199.204.138.195 zionica.com this is in the directory /private/etc/hosts.  I am not all that familiar with the Terminal nor it's commands so I'm having difficulty troubleshooting my problem.
The one thing I can think of is that I followed the following tutorial in an attempt to have SwitchHosts work in Firefox. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchhosts/reviews/286862/  Is there a way to reverse these steps?  Would that even solve my problem?

A: Note that zionica.com and www.zionica.com (or any other subdomain that comes before the word zionica) is a different domain, and the line as listed will not trap everything automatically by listing only the Second Level Domain.
www.zionica.com
www is a third-level domain, more commonly referred to as a 'sub-domain'.
zionica is the second-level domain. This word/placement on it's own generally does not have a more specific name.
com is a Top-Level Domain (TLD). Just like co, cc, org, net, ca, jp, uk, me, info, etc. (Everything except etc is a TLD.)
You can stuff multiple names into a single IP address line, so this is valid:
199.204.138.195 zionica.com www.zionica.com

A: Try running  dscacheutil -flushcache as it sounds like it's not correctly doing flushing the cache to update it.
