Q: How can I export a video to WMV format in Lion? I used to use Flip4Mac, but because QuickTime X doesn’t provide a plug-in mechanism for video exports, Flip4Mac doesn’t work with it.
How do I export videos to WMV in Lion?

A: According to this chart from Telestream site you can use Compressor 4, QT7Pro and MPEG Streamclip (never used Episode 6 so don't know what it is). You can probably install QT7 from here.
