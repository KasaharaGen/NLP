Q: How can I keep bugs out of the MacBook Pro's hinge vent? I've noticed that some flying bugs have an irritating habit of crawling into the hinge vent on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009).
I don't know what possesses them to go in there, maybe it looks like an inviting hidey-hole, but they obviously end up dying from the heat. I'm paranoid they'll eventually clog something. Bless the designer for the nice design, but it's next to impossible to fish dead bugs out of there! Ironically, because of the silent design there's also no huge gust of hot air to persuade them not to try climbing in there.
The problem is made worse when there's a light above the table drawing them in, but even without it the screen is a bright enough draw. I've seen them crash into the screen (or fall from an above light), and then make a mad dash straight into the vent. It's infuriating!
Has anyone else experienced this problem with bugs and that hinge vent? How did you de-bug yours? My only workaround so far has been to surround myself with tons of other lights on to keep them as scattered as possible...
Edit: Looking back at this question I'm disappointed that I forgot to include any regional info. At the time I was in a house in the country in Queensland, Australia. Bugs inside the house are the norm rather than the exception. I may have to wait until Summer again (in December) before I can actually test to see if this was a seasonal thing for the bugs, as I haven't been bothered by them again since then.

A: Hmmm....I have a pc and it's bug free.

Ok, ok....you might try flushing the vent openings with canned air while the computer is off.  Turn the can upside down so that you can actually get that super cold dangerous liquid in there.  Maybe there's some kind of scent that's drawing them in (is it the same species?).
