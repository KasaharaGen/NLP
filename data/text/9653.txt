Q: How do I assure that all files from a shared HFS+ drives are always writable by all users? I have a shared drive on a Mac and I keep having problems accessing different directories.
For example, while logged on the server as root I create a new folder aaa on this drive.
Now, I discover that a normal user cannot write to this directory.
Is there a way for me to change the default permissions/ACLs so I prevent this from happening in the future.
I am looking for a one-time solution, not running chmod or chown each time.
Details: 


*

*it seems that root is not member of staff group because when I do ls -l I see group _unknown listed for files created by root.

*By default the files do get only xr write for the group (drwxr-xr-x), how can I change so the group will have the same rights as the user, by default?

*Can this be changes per mounted volume or directory, or changing this would affect the entire system? Risks?


A: Get Info on said drive and checking Ignore Ownership might help you.
