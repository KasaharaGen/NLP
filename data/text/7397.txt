Q: How do I use the STIX Font in Mac OS X 10.7 I just found out that Mac OS X 10.7 ships with STIX fonts (Scientific and Technical Information Exchange format). Can someone explain me how I can make use of these fonts or where there is a tutorial on proper use of these fonts?

The mission of the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange
  (STIX) font creation project is the preparation of a comprehensive set
  of fonts that serve the scientific and engineering community in the
  process from manuscript creation through final publication, both in
  electronic and print formats.


A: These fonts should get used automatically by standard marked-up text that calls for them.  Check this test site with FireFox 4 and up:

Info on documentation of the fonts is at
