Q: How do I open a file from Spotlight in Finder? When I search for something e.g. a PDF file, in Spotlight and has i displayed in the search results list. How can I open the file in Finder? If I click on it, the file is opened e.g. in the pdf reader, but I would like to know where on the file system it is.
Any suggestions?

A: Hitting ⌘+↩ does the trick.
