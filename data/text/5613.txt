Q: Will older versions of iLife (like 06 or 08 or 09) run on Lion I'm looking and don't see any official word yet from Apple - I wondered if any web sites have reported whether these older versions work a little or at all (or perfectly well with only some little errors).
The Roaring Apps table lists only iLife 11 versions and my attempts at the top 20 results for several google searches shows a lot of content farms gaming the results.

A: iLife '08 is running fine on my OSX 10.7 computer.
Most non-PowerPC apps will run fine in Lion, so I expect all the versions you mention will be fine.

A: I don't know from experience, but there are some conversations about it out there. Check these sites:
