Q: MacBook Pro unresponsive for a few minutes after opening the lid, AirPort trying to reconnect to wifi I have a problem every time my 2010 MacBook Pro wakes up after I opened the lid.
The symptoms are as follows:


*

*The display is completely normal, I can see the latest program I used, the top bar menu, the dock, everything

*Moving the mouse is ok, and so is typing

*Clicks have no effect

*AirPort is trying to connect to a network

*Sometimes the network I usually use can't be found and I have to turn AirPort on & off to make it reconnect


This is really annoying!
I use a 2010 MBP which runs Snow Leopard 10.6.8. The problem has occurred ever since I bought it.
Does anybody have the same problem? Is there any remedy steps I can take?
Any help is appreciated,

A: Changing the network channel solved the problem!
