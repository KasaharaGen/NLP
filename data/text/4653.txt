Q: How many HD video minutes do I get per 1GB of free storage? I have 7GB free. If I give that to someone to record, what sort of ballpark figure would I get for a HD video recording? There may be about 10 individual videos being recorded over a couple of hours, if that makes a difference. Maybe just one hour long one.
I just want to know a rough figure but ideally with some maths so I can work it out myself.

A: The iPhone 4S takes video at 1080p and 30 fps and initial tests are showing that video takes 200MB per minute. At roughly 12 GB per hour, what seemed staggering a year ago is now quite quaint with the iPhone 4 recording at less than 5 GB / hour.
MacWorld reports that an hour of iPhone 4 video is 4.8 gig.

The iPhone records its 720p HD video at around 10 megabits (Mbps) per second. That translates to about 80MB per minute, as we noted above, or a staggering 4.8GB per hour. (Hope you sprung for the 32GB model!)


A: I just made a 15.5 minute test video with my iPhone 5S. File size is 1.31 GB, or 85 MB/minute. 7 GB of storage would handle 82 minutes of video.
Of course the complexity of the video and audio should have an effect on the compression, so this is just a rough guideline.

A: It's impossible to estimate without looking at the footage first, or at least having a description of what will be shot (a crowd of people running around at Grand Central or 2 people sitting on a bench), the lighting conditions (night, with no lights, or day), the way it will be shot (on a locked tripod or over the shoulder, panning left and right like a maniac), etc...
