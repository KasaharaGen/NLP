Q: Will iWork '08 support autosave and versions? Will iWork '08 work support autosave and versions? I really only use iWork like twice a year, and don't feel like buying a new one. 
EDIT: Wait! It supports app resume though! Yay! Does all app support app resume by default?

A: I don't believe iWork '08 will support those features.
