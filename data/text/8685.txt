A: Like Davo says, use the on screen keyboard when you can not use or remember the key combo.
Start -> Accessories -> Accessibilty -> On screen keyboard. Then slide it mostly out of the way while you can still click the print screen key with your mouse pointer. Edit away the on screen keyboard from the shot later if you want to.
