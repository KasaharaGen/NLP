Q: Transfer file between iPhones using Bluetooh Can I transfer data between two iPhones via Bluetooth?

A: Yes. 
There's an AppStore app called Bluetooth Fileshare ($0.99), but it has very low reviews. Also, check out Bluetooth Photo Share (free) if you're only interested in transferring photos.
If you have a jailbroken iPhone, you can use iBlueNova ($5.99), but there might be better/free ways to do file transfer if you're already jailbroken.

A: If you jsut want to transfer images/contact details etc Bump is a good app, it also works cross platform too.

A: Why not use AirDrop? You can transfer a lot of information pretty fast and don't require any new software to be loaded?
