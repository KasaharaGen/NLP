Q: Is it possible to download a podcast directly to an iPod Touch without jailbreaking? Specifically with the iPod Touch that was released in September 2010, is it possible to download a podcast directly to the unit. The answers that I've found so far involve jailbreaking, which I'm not interested in doing.
I would like to avoid having to use my main computer at all for managing podcasts, if possible.

A: You could always use a third party app like PodCaster.

A: On the iPhone which is more or less the same thing; in the iTunes application there is a podcast section under "More"
