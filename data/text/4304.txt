Q: how can I convert the values of a table into percentage values rather than absolute values? In Numbers, how can I convert the values of a table into percentage values rather than absolute values ? 
The percentage are computed per column. The sum of the cells in a column is 100%.
i.e. http://d.pr/NNwn

A: If I'm not mistaken you could do that more or less easily: 
Say for example column comedy. 
The total is 534 (sum). 


*

*132 (1st row) is the 24.71% (132 x 100 / 534). 

*3 (2nd Row) is the 0.56%â€¦ 

*1 is the 0.18% 

*398 is the 74.53%.


The sum of 24.71+0.56+0.18+74.53 == 100% (minus rounding, add more decimals for more precision).
So if you add a final ROW with the SUM  (below technology for example) you can cause each cell to perform a Cell * 100 / TOTAL_OF_COLUMN and get your %.
What am I missing?
