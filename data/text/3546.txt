Q: Memory upgrade for MBP I'm looking to upgrade my 15'' 2011 MBP from 4 GB to 8 GB. The memory upgrade on the Apple Store is 200$, apparently it can be done for ~100 $ quite easily.
I've seen this 2x8GB kit from Crucial: Crucial 2x4GB memory kit.
Do you think it's a good choice ? Any better ideas ?

A: The Crucial kit is one of the better ones out there.  I've used their modules in the past.  However, on my new MBP, I decided to get the 8 GB from Apple.
I'd go with the Crucial if you want good quality and great value.
Here is a video showing installation
