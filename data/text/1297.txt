Q: Is there any way to watch Hulu (or Hulu Plus) on the new Apple TV? I was hoping Airplay might do this, but when I turn it on in the Hulu Plus app, it only streams the audio to the ATV.

A: Unfortunately, it seems that AirPlay is audio only for third-party apps for the time being, and there's no other way to get Hulu Plus on the Apple TV.

A: When AirPlay support for Safari is added (supposedly in 2011 - see below), you may be able to do this.
