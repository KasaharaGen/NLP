Q: Mac blogging client similar to Windows Live Writer Can someone suggest a really good blogging client for Mac OS? 
I am looking for something having similar functionality like Windows Live Writer (on Windows).
Blog details: WordPress (installed on Windows).
I have a Mac laptop at home, and am trying to decide on a blogging client for WordPress.

A: I haven't had any exposure to live writer, but maybe you might want to give MarsEdit a try. It can interface with many different blogging systems.

A: Other than the MarsEdit, You may also want to try the Ecto, or MacJournal
