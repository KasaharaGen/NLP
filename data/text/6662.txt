Q: How to search better in App Store As an example ...
If I wanted to see all commercial airplane simulator games out there, how would I accomplish this without going to see title by title?
http://itunes.apple.com/au/genre/ios-games-simulation/id7015?mt=8&letter=A&page=2#page
As using iTunes I can only see this


Is there an external website / application that we can easily search what are we looking for?


A: Not entirely sure if it fits the bill, but a great alternative App Store search app is AppShopper. It lets you do far more advanced searches and really helps pick up bargains and special offers too!
