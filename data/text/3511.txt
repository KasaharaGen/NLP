Q: Invoke QuickLook in Open/Save dialogue windows A handy tip I discovered by accident.
Highlight any file in an Open/Save window, press the space bar and voila! there is your file in all it's glory. 

A: Well thank you! :D
This will certainly be useful.
Just as a note to everyone who sees this, it apparently only works on the window, not on the dropdown. I cant get the quicklook in the Save As dialogue.
