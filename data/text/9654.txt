Q: FrontRow or App like FrontRow on Lion Is FrontRow available for Mac OS X Lion or is there some third party app which does roughly the same?
I particular like about FrontRow being able to use it with my Mac Remote and I love to watch trailers / dvds. iTunes integration is not that much of importance to me, but would be a nice to have.

A: You can either try to get Front Row running on Lion, or try Plex.

*Front Row was discontinued in OS X Lion; that’s probably why you can’t find it. That said, there’s nothing to stop you running it, if you don’t mind a few limitations. Ralph Perdomo has some instructions for Front Row on Lion (http://www.mac-hatter.com/blog/frontrowenablerforlion), although they require you to stay on iTunes 10.3, which doesn’t work with some iOS devices. If you’re really attached to Front Row, this probably works, but I haven’t tried it.

*Plex (http://www.plexapp.com/mac.php) also seems pretty decent; I know a lot of people who use it and are very happy with it. Sort of like Front Row, but it pulls content from lots of other places, including iTunes. This support page suggests that they support the Apple Remote, as you wanted. You might like to check that one out.

A: I highly recommend Plex for this - I use it to play movies and music off my Pro, via gigabit, to an old MBP connected to a 40" LCD.
I can confirm it uses the Apple Remote, and works really, really well.
