Q: Can you create shortcut in Lions Launchpad? As it says in title. I want to add one for Eclipse, to have all in one place.

A: Assuming you still have the Launchpad icon on your dock try dropping the app you want to be added to Launchpad on it.
Haven't tried it myself, but I recall reading about it somewhere.
