Q: Apple RAM for MacBook Pro vs other brands 
Possible Duplicate:
Apple-Certified RAM? 

Apple RAM for the unibody MacBook Pro's typically has a large markup to it. I am wondering if it's different than Crucial or other brands in quality..

A: I have also used Crucial memory in my MacBook Pros and have never had an issue with it.
Apple's support doc gives the memory specs to match against and does not require "Apple" RAM.

A: No different from a brand like Crucial. In fact I have had the experience in the past of adding Crucial RAM to a Mac system and the system profiler reporting the exact same manufacturer code and part number for the new module as the already existing ones
