Q: Growl notifications with Mail.app? Is it possible to configure Mail.app to use the growl notifications for incoming mail ?
Maybe there is an external script doing that too ?

A: You need to download GrowlMail, however every time MacOS X is updated the version of GrowlMail becomes outdated and won't run (under Snow Leopard, at least). 
I think that the current version of GrowlMail doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.6.7 at present. Details of why it keeps breaking are here. It is annoying but seems unavoidable.

A: Growl is great, but there's a standalone extension that adds way more functionality to Mail.app. It's called Herald: http://erikhinterbichler.com/software/herald/
Herald is continuing the awesome tradition of Mail.appetizer, if you remember that one from a few years ago. It is superior.

A: I outlined my method of using Growl in conjunction with Apple Mail, mail rules and AppleScript here: Is there any way to get a pop-up notification on my iPhone or iPad when mail arrives?
The code for the AppleScript is also included in the answer I provided.
