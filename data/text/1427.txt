Q: What is a good indestructible iPad case for toddlers? Does anyone know of any iPad cases that are so indestructible, that you would entrust a 3-year-old with an iPad?

A: Check out OtterBox's Defender product line. I don't own any of their products, but I've heard from others that they're close to indestructible.

A: I don't think there is one. The glass-front of the iPad is way to big for any case to make handling it completely secure.
If I had kids, I would just stay with them and observe them while they play with my gadgets.
