Q: iPhone 4 car kit for sound and video recording, and charging I need a kit that I can mount in my car on the dashboard where I can do the following with my iPhone 4G:


*

*Use GPS

*Record Video from the forward facing camera (toward me) or the rear facing camera (away from me / through the front windshield)

*Make phone calls hands free (using the speaker phone or the headphones kit that comes with the iPhone or with a Casette Adapter for iPhone)


Is there a mount that I can use for this?

A: Or if you'd like to save some money, check this search query at DealExtreme: iPhone dash mount - there is a huge range, and for great prices too. 
I've purchased plenty of things from them before, and it's all been surprisingly good stuff, especially considering the price.
