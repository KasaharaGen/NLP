Q: iPhone Dead, No Charger Someone dropped their iPhone near my door. The neighbor picked it up, phoned me, and told me it has my number in it so it's probably someone I know.
But now, the phone is dead, and I don't have an iPhone charger to charge it. How can I turn this thing on?

A: Go to the nearest Apple store and ask to use one of their chargers. From my previous experiences, they are usually very helpful.

A: As popular as iDevices are I would think that you would be able to find someone with one that is close by... heck I can think of 5 people at work, off the top of my head plus myself...
