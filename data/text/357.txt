Q: Create bookmark folders on iPhone or iPad? Is it possible to create a new bookmark folder using iOS? I share my bookmarks between four devices (using MobileMe) and it would be useful to be able to structure them in a useful way.

A: Here's how you do it in iOS 4.1:


*

*In Safari, hit the bookmarks icon

*Press the "Edit" button in the lower left

*In the lower right, a "New Folder" button appears. Press it.

*Type in the name of the folder and hit "Done" on the keyboard.
