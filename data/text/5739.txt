Q: Any DvdFab/DvdShrink comparable program for Mac? I want to rip a dvd (and/or blu-ray) to an ISO, but remove some of the features on the disk (i.e. menus, extra features).  DvdFab and DvdShrink for Windows allow users to do this.  Any similar programs for Mac?

A: RipIt is the best I've seen. You can try it free, it is paid software with a novel guarantee. If you can't rip a title, they will buy that title and fix their software for you.

A: Yup, it's called Mac DVD Ripper Pro, it works great on my Snow Leopard MacBook Pro, and it's Lion-compatible according to the RoaringApps website. It costs $19.95 at the moment, and the free demo works on 5 DVDs, website is here:

FYI, the RoaringApps Lion app compatibility table is here:

A: How about HandBrake?
