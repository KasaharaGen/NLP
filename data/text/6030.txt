Q: Can I safely delete the Classic System folder when running Lion? I still have a folder called "System Folder" that belongs to the Classic environment. It takes up almost 400MB on my disk. Since I'm running Lion, can I safely delete the entire folder?

A: Considering the Classic environment was phased out versions ago, I think it would be completely safe to delete a folder belonging to the classic environment.

A: It's probably safe to delete it, unless you're like me.  For example, I still keep a directory of pictures in the Appearance directory that I use for wallpaper.  Old habits die hard. :-) You might want to check if you have anything similarly quirky.

A: Absolutely. Everything equivalent that Lion needs resides in the new "System" folder (and others) so you can freely delete your old System Folder. 

A: I did a clean install of Lion and there is no "/System Folder/" there, therefore I believe that you can safely delete the folder "/System Folder/" however make sure you do not delete the "/System/" folder, otherwise you'll be left with an unbootable system.
(Of course you have a working backup, right ;-?)
