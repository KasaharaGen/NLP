Q: How do you install Adobe AIR on an ipad Adobe AIR does not appear in the App Store - this is Australia, on an iPad 2.
Are there geographic restrictions - surely it isn't sideloaded?

A: Given your comment on Adam Rice's answer. I believe that you're mistaken about how one would use Air with an iOS device.
You don't actually put Air on the device. You write your app with Air, then use Adobe's packager to turn it into a native iOS app.

A: You don't.
There aren't geographic restrictions: there are universal restrictions. As is the case with Flash—or pretty much anything that can interpret arbitrary code—Apple is not going to allow Air onto iOS.
