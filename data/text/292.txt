Q: Is it possible to sync Google Chrome bookmarks with Safari? Is it possible to sync Google Chrome bookmarks with Safari?

A: Use Xmarks worked OK for me except for Firefox where it duplicated the book marks each time I used it.
Althougn now in Mavericks or because of a later version of Firefox it works

A: Another solution: on Windows machine install iCloud Control Panel (http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1455) and check option "Bookmarks" which sync your iCloud Safari bookmarks with Chrome, IE and Firefox.
P.S. Yes, for this solution necessarily need a machine with Windows
