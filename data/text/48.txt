Q: iPad virtual keyboard text entry: Can I disable the automatic upper-casing that takes place after I end a sentence? When using the iPad to type a note, for instance, every time I type a period, the iPad assumes I want to start the next word with a capital letter.  It also assumes I want to start typing with a capital letter in some text fields on web forms.  Is there any way to turn off the automatic SHIFT that is taking place, so there are only capital letters where I explicitly want them to be?

A: *

*Go to settings

*Go to general

*Go to keyboard

*Toggle and disable auto-capitalization
