Is there any way to always display menu bar in full screen mode in Lion?

A: I don't think so.
An alternative way is like, create a new Desktop, move the application you want to full screen into that new Desktop, and make that application screen as big as the Desktop.  So, you have a dedicated Desktop for that application, full screen, and with the menu bar.
