Q: Window manipulation software

Do any window managers allow me to snap windows to the sides of the display? 

I was wondering if there is software out there that will make OS X windows act like Windows 7. For instance, you can "bump" a window at the top of the screen and it will fill the screen. Or, "bumping" the left/right will make the window become half-screen.

A: I just found a nice app for these functions! It's called cinch and it is aviable in the appstore for 7$ (but you can also use the demo)

A: An alternative to Cinch that is less mouse-based and more keyboard-based is DoublePane. It is available in the Mac App Store. It provides you with easy keyboard shortcuts to place windows side-by-side, full screen or back to their original positions. It is inexpensive and works as advertised. Hope this helps.
