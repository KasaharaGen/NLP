Q: How can I open port 443 in Mac OS X 10.6? I have a local apache running on my macbook pro and I need to run a SSL website on the local host. I have everything configured in Apache, but can't open port 443 on mac. I tried to add ipfw rule to allow 443 but it doesn't work. 

A: make sure 443 accessible from local and configured.
$ netstat -an|grep 443

allow 443 in ipfw
$ sudo ipfw add allow tcp from any to any 443


A: Open file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
Look for line with listen 80
Add line           listen 443 
Save and restart apache using          apachectl graceful
Check for any error in http.conf using apachectl configtest
