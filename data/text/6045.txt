Q: Prevent Apple Double Format Files on Remote Share/Disk I have a web application on a local Linux Apache server that scans a folder for new files and then processes them.
I have an SMB share to this folder and I use Path Finder to copy files over from my Mac (10.6).
The problem is that when I copy files over a whole lot of "._filename" resource fork files get created on the share and then the web application gets confused when it encounters them. I could fix the web application to be a bit smarter and ignore them, but this is also annoying when archiving and copying to external drives.
I have managed to turn off .DS_Store files and I did see a similar question with an answer, but it seemed to be dealing with NTFS Streams and a nsmb.conf file.

A: There is an application called BlueHarvest that fully automates the clean up of these files.

Alternatively, you can use terminal:
cp -X /sourcedirectory/ /volumes/destinationsmbshare/

Finder
Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems. For some types of copy/move routines, ._ (dot underscore) files are required. 
File system
If you prevent creation of ._ files at the file system level, you make that file system partially incompatible with at least: 


*

*Apple Finder

*Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011.


(For any use case that involves Office 2011 saving to a file system, you must allow ._ on that file system … and so on.)

For more detail please see my answer to an older question, Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?:

*Purposes of .DS_Store and ._ files
