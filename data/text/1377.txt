Q: Having Remote Desktop in Full screen view Is it possible to have Remote Desktop running in Full Screen mode ? Like it is possible to have with Real VNC, for instance. 

A: 
In 3.3.2 you can have it running full screen by clicking the fullscreen icon; but the client will only appear in full screen mode if it has the same resolution. Smaller resolutions will be surrounded by a black box. 
I haven't tried this: but clients with higher resolutions will probably full the screen if they have the same aspect ratio, but they might look a bit funky.

A: As an aside - "Screen Sharing" actually is just a VNC client.  You can a different VNC client to connect to the remote Mac as well, doesn't have to be screen sharing.
