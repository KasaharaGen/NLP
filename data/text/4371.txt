Q: Address bar in Safari gone! The address bar in my safari broswer has disappeared... I have quit my safari browser and reopened it, but the problem persists. This is what it looks like  I have no idea why this is happening, but i use safari as my main browser so it has all my bookmarks, etc so i can't really just stop using it. Please help, thanks.

A: With the introduction of Safari 6.0, the command key sequence changed for this from command + shift +  |  to command + option + T.
It's also the first item under the view menu, 'Show Toolbar' or 'Hide Toolbar.'
edit: in Safari 7.0 and OS X 10.9, this feature is still available through View > Hide Toolbar or View > Show Toolbar, however there is no command key sequence.

A: Right click in the empty area > "Customize Toolbar" > drag the address bar back up.
You probably accidentally command-dragged it out.
