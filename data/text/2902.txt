Q: Changing Chrome's User Agent? Is it possible to change Chrome (or Chrome based browsers) user agents on OSX? I dont see a menu or preference option for doing so.

A: This link shows how to do it using Terminal. The Terminal command that opens Chrome using the Safari user agent string:
open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app   --args -user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_3; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.19"

I tested this, and it works with the current version of Chrome. You can find various User-Agent strings here.

A: ScriptNo

...is an extension for Google Chrome which brings some of Firefox's NoScript extension functionality in a user-friendly fashion to Chrome.
It also features the ability of user-agent spoofing.
