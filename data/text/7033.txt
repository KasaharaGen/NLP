Q: What do the new Terms and Conditions for the iTunes Store mean? In the new Terms and Conditions for the iTunes store, it says that the following has changed:

Notification of an additional type of previously purchased content
  that may be subsequently downloaded to certain computers and devices
  as an accommodation to you, subject to existing association rules; and
  that such content may be played back on certain devices that are not
  subject to existing association rules, with limitations.

What does this mean?

A: It means you can download TV shows you've purchased in the past for different Apple devices, though it may not always be available to download at all times.
