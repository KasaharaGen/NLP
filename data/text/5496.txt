Q: How can I delete "Passenger" from my "System Preference"? About 2 years ago I tried and installed Phusion Passenger Preference Pane for OS X and now I need to delete its "Passenger" icon from my System Preference. There's no uninstall option, how can I delete it?
I use Mac OS X 10.5.8



A: Just right click the icon and select remove. (it will be moved to trash which you can empty to get rid of it completely)
