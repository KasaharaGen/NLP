Q: Does iWork support OpenOffice filetypes? I was thinking about getting iWork as a replacement for OpenOffice. 
Since I usually saved my files to the OpenOffice format (OpenDocument), I was wondering if it's possible to read these files with iWork. Most important would be reading of .odt (Text) and .ods (Spreadsheets). The ability to write these files isn't that important.
Saving the files to MS-Office first isn't an option though.
I also noticed that Quick-Look displays .odt files on a system that doesn't have OpenOffice installed so there's probably already some OpenDocument support built into OS X?

A: I just created some test documents (.odt, .ods, .odf) in OpenOffice and I was unable to open them in iWork. I was able, however, to open the .odt in TextEdit, which probably accounts for the Quick Look compatibility you mentioned.
