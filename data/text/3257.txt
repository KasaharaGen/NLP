Q: Calendar alert sound on the iPodTouch isn't loud enough is there some "mobile" way to make it louder? Calendar alert sound on the iPodTouch isn't loud enough is there some "mobile" way to make it louder?

A: As far as "volume boost" or "overdrive" type features are concerned, I don't think there is one. You could always get a battery powered external speaker.
When I'm out driving I usually plug my iPhone into my car stereo and listen to music / Pandora. It quiets the music (but doesn't pause) to play notification sounds, so it's quite audible.

A: I would just change the ringer on it to something louder. You can make it different in Settings -> Sounds.

A: Head over to Settings - Sounds and check whether the volume of the ringer is on its loudest. 
On my iPod there is a different volume for my music and one for my ringer (FaceTime :)
