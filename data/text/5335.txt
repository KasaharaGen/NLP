Q: Keyboard remapping in Lion? I've used keyremap4macbook for the last few years to turn the right Alt key into a forward delete. Unfortunately, the tool has stopped working in Lion.
Does anybody know of a keyboard remapper that already works in Lion?

A: Turns out I had an old version.
The new, officially Lion compatible version from the keyremap4macbook homepage works fine.
