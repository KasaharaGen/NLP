Q: How can I use Google shortening service (http://goo.gl) in Twitter for iPhone? I tried to configure Google service as custom URL shortening service by adding this url http://goo.gl but it's not working.
Any idea ?



A: You need to add a wildcard to the URL to tell the application where to insert the original URL.
Your custom url should look like this: 
http://myshortener.com/shorten?url=%@

However, it looks like this isn't as simple as this on goo.gl. I'll update when I find a way without any proxy-site or other things.
