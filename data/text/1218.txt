Q: Run Command Line Script from Finder's contextual menu I have a shell script that deletes exif data from images.
I would like to right-click the folder with the images and execute the command from the context menu. How can I do this?
The Shell script is:
exiftool -all= -overwrite_original test

where test is the dir with the images

A: If you're using Snow Leopard, you can create a Service, and it'll show up in a submenu of the contextual menu (as well as in the Services submenu of the Finder menu).  To do this:


*

*Run /Applications/Automator.app

*Choose the Service template

*Set the Service Receives Selected pop-up (above the workflow column on the right) to "Files and Folders"

*Find the Run Shell Script action in the second column (the search field at the top can help), and drag it to the workflow column

*Set the action's Pass input: pop-up to "as arguments"

*In the template script that appears, replace echo "$f" with exiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$f" -- the script should now look like this:
for f in "$@"
do
    exiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$f"
done


*Save the Service with some descriptive name
