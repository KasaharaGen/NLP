Q: How can I remove the Finder icon from my Dock? I've started using Forklift as a Finder replacement, so I don't need Finder in my Dock. In fact, I would much rather have Forklift be the farthest left icon so I don't accidentally click on Finder.
The usual method of dragging the app out of the Dock doesn't work, and neither does command-dragging. The contextual menu doesn't allow you to remove the icon.
Is there some way to, on Lion, remove the Finder from the Dock?
Perhaps there's a database or plist file I can change?

A: There is no easy way to do this, but there is a little hack :)


*

*Navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/

*Backup DockMenus.plist

*Open DockMenus.plist in your favorite text editor with root access

*Find section finder-running and add new sub-section
<dict>
    <key>command</key>
    <integer>1004</integer>
    <key>name</key>
    <string>REMOVE_FROM_DOCK</string>
</dict>

or just Download my version of DockMenus.plist

*In plist editor file should look like this:


*Open Terminal and run killall Dock. 

*Right click on Finder icon in Dock - Bingo!
 
p.s After Dock restart (manual relaunch or mac reboot) you need manually remove Finder icon from Dock 

A: It works for me on HighSierra (10.13.6) with SIP disabled.
I have used the following command to edit the .plist file:
PL="/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/DockMenus.plist"&&
sudo -- defaults write $PL finder-running -array-add  '<dict><key>command</key><integer>1004</integer><key>name</key><string>REMOVE_FROM_DOCK</string></dict>'

Check result with sudo defaults read $PL finder-running.
If it looks fine run sudo chmod -v +r $PL; killall Dock.
Here is the Italian formatted version of that AppleScript:
tell application "System Events"
    tell UI element "Finder" of list 1 of process "Dock"
        perform action "AXShowMenu"
        click menu item "Rimuovi dal Dock" of menu 1
    end tell
end tell

Thatâ€™s all, I hope it is useful as a quick complete recap.
