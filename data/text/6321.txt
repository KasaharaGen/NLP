Q: What is the best dropbox compatible iPad app for MS office documents? It's pretty simple. I just got an iPad and want to get the best app to edit word documents that I have saved in my dropbox. There are many options: pages, quick office, docs to go, office2.
I am looking to be able to browse documents within DropBox and tap edit to open them in the editor. I'll make a few changes and expect to be able to tap save and have it automatically update DropBox. 

A: I'm a professional writer, I've tried out a bunch of these apps, and I prefer Dataviz’s Documents to Go Premium, which creates and edits Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). The great thing about the Premium version (and justifies the extra $6 over the basic version) is that it connects with the Dropbox online storage service. Documents to Go does a good job of editing Word documents, including maintaining styles, etc.

A: My father uses DocsToGo and he´s happy. But he doesn't have a mac. But he said that it works very well for him.

A: Documents To Go now trumps QuickOffice after QO dropped support for Dropbox. Also has a more friendly and flexible interface. 

A: Quickoffice is a great app, but it no longer supports Dropbox.
