Upgrading stuck with a 3014 error. Any help highly appreciated.
Update: Apple says error 3014 tends to appear when there is not enough free disk space on your Mac. Actually I have only 6GB left on my hard drive, I will try to free more space and try upgrading again.

A: Today, it means the Apple server is overwhelmed.  Try again tomorrow.

A: The 3014 upgrade error was resolved by freeing up disk space on my mac.

A: iTunes always logs an error when this fails - in your case, the text has the following tips:

Error codes in the 3000 range generally mean that iTunes cannot contact the gs.apple.com server on ports 80 or 443. This may be because out-of-date or incorrectly configured security or firewall software is interfering, an old version of iTunes is installed, an entry in your hosts file redirecting requests to gs.apple.com (see error 1004 above), or because of your Internet proxy settings.
