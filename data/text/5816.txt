Q: Getting "not eligible to build" error when updating iPad 2 to 4.3.3 I'm trying to update my iPad 2 firmware to 4.3.3 but iTunes is giving me a "not eligible to build" error. I have tried editing my host files, but to no avail.

A: *

*Download 4.3.5 instead

*Update your Java by going to software update. Which OS x version did you have previously?
