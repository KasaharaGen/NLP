Q: How can I use Sparrow to send iCal e-mail notifications instead of Mail.app? I am really annoyed how iCal uses Mail.app to try to send e-mail notifications. It always pops up Mail.app and I do not want it to at all. How can I make iCal use Sparrow instead to send e-mail notifications/reminders?
I tried this: http://gidogeek.com/post/6037637963/ical-sparrow
But that didn't work for some reason.

A: There is a solution to your issue but it requires a little AppleScript jiggery pokery.
Johan Bruning posted an AppleScript for this on GitHub. He's included instructions for installing it in the README which is also visible on the project's GitHub page.
In his blog post about the script he writes, "I am happy to report it works like a charm and my iCal now finally sends e-mails trough Sparrow."

A: It is still using Mail.app because the script from github is the original. You need the other one which seems to be missing. Someone will need to contact the author to let him know that it is not showing up.

A: As mentioned, I'm not sure about the specifics of your question/input, but I can confirm that the modified script does not function as the author intended (or confirmed as such). Apple Mail is still used to send notifications of iCal events even though I have completed the script workaround originally mentioned.
