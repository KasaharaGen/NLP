Q: iOS app to transfer images, photos to another phone via Bluetooth Is there an app that can help me get connected to bluetooth in mobile phones manufactured by companies like nokia, samsunng, etc

A: The iPhone 4 does not support the Bluetooth OPP profiles which you need for standard device to device transfers. All you have available are 


*

*HFP (handsfree)

*PBAP (Phonebook access)

*A2DP (advanced audio distribution)

*AVRCP (av remote)

*PAN (Personal Area Network)

*HID (Human Interface)


Peer to peer comms are possible over BT but the app has to implement the protocol stack itself

A: There is word out on a jailbroken app in development called Celeste that should be able to do that and is rumored to be release soon.
If you are still on iOS3 you could try iBlueNova.

A: You can use iBlueNova; it is a commercial app that you have to pay for. Alternatively, you can jailbreak your iPhone and maybe then you can send pictures and files to other phones without needing a commercial app.
