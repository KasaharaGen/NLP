Q: Xcode 4.1 not downloading - Lion I am trying to download Xcode 4.1 from the Mac App Store (I am on Lion, and I have Xcode 3 installed). The problem is that the download bar barely moved, and after being stuck there for an hour it reset to 0%. 

A: You can remove the partial download by searching for Install in spotlight, then return to the purchased section and re-download the installer.
A reboot will ensure it's not paused or some temporary error has caused the slowness.

A: If the App Store download doesn't work, you could download (for free) the Xcode dmg directly from Downloads for Apple Developers.
