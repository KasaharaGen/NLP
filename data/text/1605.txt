Q: Freeware for extracting 7zip files? I've used The Unarchiver for this purpose, but it doesn't support extracting encrypted 7zip files. Can anyone suggest any other freeware for this?
BTW I'm using Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8

A: Softonic has a nice list of 7Zip for Mac utilities. Some are freeware. 

A: Some unofficial p7zip packages for Mac OS X exist, you can try them.

A: I've been using 7zX for unzipping 7zip archives. It works with passworded  and encrypted (with -mhe=on) archives. http://sixtyfive.xmghosting.com/products/7zx/
