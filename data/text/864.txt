iPads in the corporate world

Has anyone remote desktop into a Windows-based corporate network with an iPad? What has been your experience? How do you address the issue of multiple domains? Is this even possible? 
Currently, I just connect my laptop to a network cable and remote desktop from one domain into another domain to get to my desktop computer into a different location.
Is this possible with an iPad? How would my regular network cable connect to an iPad?

A: If you’re talking about accessing a Remote Desktop via a RDC Client, There are a lot of applications that work fine. I’m personally using iTap Mobile RDP and it’s fantastic.

A: To answer your networking question: You can connect an iPad to a computer, or to a Wi-Fi connection (or both), but you can't connect an Ethernet cable to an iPad.
