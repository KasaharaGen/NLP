Q: Can't shift+select in Finder in Lion 10.7.1 In previous versions of Mac OS X, to select a whole row of files, you select the file which comes first in the row and then select the last file with a shift+click.
When I try this procedure in icon view in Lion, it behaves as if I would select the files separately.
What changed? Is there a way to restore the old behavior?

A: Problem solved: Seems to be a feature when you try to shift+select files in icon view
