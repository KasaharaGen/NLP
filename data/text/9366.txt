Q: I want to hear sound of push notification when sound is turned off (like iOS alarm clock) When I receive a push notification no sound is played when the sound is switched of on the device (with switch on side of iPhone). 
When I add an alarm event in the iOS clock I do hear the sound although sound is switched off.
Can I force to play sound with Push notifications when sound is switched off?

everybody thanks for the response (this was a programming question)
with regards,
Frank
PS I don't know what is meant by fixing up my accept rate but I'll have a look into that...

A: You can't, the push notification is handled by the iOS. If the user muted his device there is no way force it to play sound on receiving a push notification.
The reason the alarm can play a sound is because it is not bound by the apple rules for app s from the app store.
