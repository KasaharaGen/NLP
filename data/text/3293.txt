Q: Is there a way to use Skype on iPad with audio chat only? I'm having first version of iPad and a USB headphone. is it possible to use skype on iPad? I'm on Wi-Fi.

A: I was using Skype on my 3rd gen iPod for audio calls, so I wont think you'll have have any problems using it on a 1st gen iPad.

A: You cannot use USB Headset with an iOS device, however, you can use Skype on your iPad with the iPhone headset or with the integrated mic and speaker.
