Q: Could aluminium dust inside a Macbook Air create a short circuit? I have a Macbook Air and I'm very happy with it, except for the fact that it made a creaky noise. It turned out the bottom plate wasn't screwed on properly and I had to reseat it (I tried to let a Genius do this, but out of the three Geniuses I visited, no one of them had  the proper screwdriver and wanted to take my Macbook for repair or switch it for a new one, I refused this because I don't want to live for a week or more because of such a stupid problem). 
So I bought a special pentalobe screwdriver and screwed the bottom plate off. I noticed there was some aluminium dust inside the Macbook Air because the plate has been moving a little and has been scraping onto the body. 
Could this dust create a short circuit theoretically? 
One little problem is that one screw (of the 10 screws) doesn't tighten anymore, because the bottom plate has been screwed on wrongly in the first place. What kind of glue is the best to use to attach the screw? Of course it must be possible to unscrew it at some point when I want to install a new/bigger SSD.
This might sound terrible to the Apple fans who don't want to mess with their machines, but I don't think getting it repaired by a Genius or switching it with a new one solves anything, because this creaking problem is very common and it might start all over again.

A: Loctite make a range of semi-permanent gunks for "gluing" screws in place.  A good hardware shop (on-line or in real life) would help.
There would have to be a lost of dust for it to be a problem. 

A: Aluminum is a conductor, so it is theoretically possible that a trail of aluminum dust could create a short circuit, but I've never encountered any reports of this causing problems in a computer.
