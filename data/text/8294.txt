Q: Create multiple bookmarks on iPad/iPhone home screen at once I have a list of about 10 bookmarks I want to create as iOS home screen icons. Are there quick ways to do this?
And is there a way to edit them once they're created?

A: I would nope and nope, at least without jailbreaking.
You can only create bookmark one by one and name them as you want.
Once they are created, the only way to rename them is to create a new one and delete the old one.
Jailbreaking allows to rename any apps, so I think web apps, too. I'm not sure about editing home screen web apps.
