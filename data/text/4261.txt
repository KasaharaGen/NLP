Q: What's fastest: iPhone 4 tethering with bluetooth, usb or the new hotspot feature? I'm going to use the internet on a MacBook 5,2 and I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.3.1 and it's jailbroken (and using TetherMe), if it makes any differences.

A: Fastest to slowest:


*

*USB

*WiFi hotspot

*Bluetooth


Keep in mind the power draw of the options. From most battery efficient to least:


*

*USB (It helps that it's also charging at the same time.)

*Bluetooth

*WiFi


A: Bluetooth with iPhone's specifications has a max. throughput of 3 MBit/s. So this could be a bottleneck if you get higher 3G speeds.
