Q: Why don't my arrow keys work in vim under iTerm? They work just fine if I use Terminal and start a vim session, but under iTerm I have to resort to using H-J-K-L to do left-up-down-right movement.
In both Terminal and iTerm TERM=xterm-color. My .vimrc is quite lean and there are no key bindings set in there that would causing this problem.
iTerm v0.10.

A: The following worked for me.
In iTerm2:


*

*Profiles -> Open Profiles...

*Edit Profiles...

*Keys tab

*From Load Preset... drop-down, pick Terminal.app compatibility


A: Try the following:


*

*From the Bookmarks menu item, select Manage Bookmarks....

*Choose the Default bookmark and click the edit icon.

*Change the Keyboard setting to Global.


A: This is how I fixed:
nnoremap <silent> <ESC>^[A <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <ESC>^[B <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <ESC>^[D <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <ESC>^[C <Nop>

Note: 
The "^[" characters must not be typed, instead you get them by doing: âŒƒ-V and pressing the corresponding cursor arrow position (up,down,left,right). 
Tested with: iTerm2 (Build 1.0.0.20140629)

A: I was able to get this sorted out with iTerm2 Build 3.0.15 and the following excerpt from my .vimrc:
" Map alternate key combination for Esc.
noremap <c-[> <Esc>
" Map arrow keys for nomal mode.
nnoremap <silent> <Esc><Up>A <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <Esc><Down>B <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <Esc><Right>C <Nop>
nnoremap <silent> <Esc><Left>D <Nop>

HTH.

A: The fastest (and probably best) way to solve this is to switch iterm profile keymapping to "Natural editing" preset.

*

*Go to preferences

*Go to profiles

*Go to keys

*Go to keymappings

*From preset dropdown select natural editing preset
