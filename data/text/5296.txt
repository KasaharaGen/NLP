Q: How can I rename a folder in Lion's Launchpad? I created a folder by dropping one icon on top of another.
Now I want to rename that folder, since the default name, "Utility" isn't the one I want.
According to all advice I find on the internet, I should open the folder and then double-click the title in order to rename it.
But, when I double-click the title, nothing is happening. Is there a lock somewhere I have to turn off?
This is what I tried:


*

*Double-Clicking

*Right-Clicking

*Ctrl-Clicking

*Option-Clicking

*Command-Clicking


What else?

A: Ok, I did a google search and came across a page where others are having the same problem.
The reply by etresoft - https://discussions.apple.com/message/15661045#15661045 - basically says to kill the Dock application and it should restart automatically, and then it should work.
I did that, started Activity Monitor, found Dock, and force-quit it, it started right up again, and afterwards renaming worked as expected.

A: Once the folder created (with the name Utility) you click (once) on the folder to open it, 
once opened the name of the folder appears in bold + the different apps inside that folder.
To change the name, click on the name (shown inside the folder) to change it.
