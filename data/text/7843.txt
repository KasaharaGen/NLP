Q: Mac App Store stuck with app update It's been like this for months:

A friend of mine downloaded Angry Birds on his account, then signed out. Then a week later I said "I'm never going to play this." and deleted the app, however, the update still remains.
Hitting update returns "Unknown Error".  Attempting to purchase Angry Birds again or re-sintall it on any account (even my friends) returns "Unknown Error", and then "The app store encountered a problem. Please try again later. (4)"
How can I get it to go away!? It won't display my other app updates either! My update tab is just broken and stuck on Angry Birds.
Here's what I've tried:


*

*Using AppZapper to remove App Store pref files. Works for a moment, then if you hit the updates tab it refreshes and goes back.

*Re-installing Angry Birds

*Changing accounts and trying the above.

*Signing out of iTunes
Nothing works. Am I doomed to see that update forever?
