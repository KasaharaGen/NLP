Q: Jailbroken iPad stuck at boot screen and looping I have a jailbroken iPad 1 with iOS 4.2.1 


*

*I replaced hosts file under /etc/ and resprang    

*the iPad stuck at blank screen   

*I restarted by pressing both power and home key  

*Now the iPad is stucking and looping at apple logo booting screen


Currently,    


*

*I can access the file system using iPhoneBrowser 1.9.3 and     

*iTunes 10.2.1 recognizes the iPad. 

*WIFI interface seems to be up but SSH is not up


Now, I have replaced the modified hosts with original file.     
Still the screen never reached the lock screen.    I doubt it is file system error and in this circumstances how can I check my iPad for file system error? Is there a way?

A: The obvious answer is to re-install the OS and then ssh in to run fsck.
Have you looked into a program like PhoneView that will let you mount iOS device as an external drive and use Disk Utility (if you have a Mac) or fsck? The FAQ for PhoneView has a windows software recommendation that does about the same things if you prefer that OS on the desktop.
(edit: I don't know of any free alternatives that mount the file system)
