Q: Does adjusting the volume in iTunes alter audio quality? Will setting the volume adjustment to 100% change the quality of the song?
Furthermore, if I change the volume adjustment back to 0%, will any quality be lost?


A: Setting the volume to 100% will not affect the quality of the audio playback.
