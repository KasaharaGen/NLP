Q: How can I reduce the time it takes to sync my ipod touch I have a 64 GB ipod touch with about:


*

*20 GB of music on my external hard drive

*20 GB of photos on my external hard drive

*About 50 apps


It now seems to take over 40 minutes for my ipod-touch to do a full sync regardless if there is anything new or not (pics, etc) to sync


*

*How can i find out what is taking so long?  Is there anyway to view a log file or something to highlight if a specific app or something else is driving this slowness

*I see things going on (like copying Genius results, etc).  Is there a way to control the sync process and turn any of these features off) to try to make it faster.
Also, itunes.exe basically runs at 95%+ CPU during the sync process.

A: From everything I've read, photos do seem to be the biggest factor in long sync times. 
Exhibit A: This blog post suggests to not sync photos:

If I have photos unchecked, everything syncs and it's fast (7 seconds).

You can give that a shot to see if your sync time improves (as a troubleshooting measure)
Exhibit B: Apple Support suggests that importing the camera roll can improve sync times
Worst case, as @hobs mentions, you can restore your device as a new device from a backup (see this Apple Support page for details).

A: Try Process Explorer http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653 and turn on the Columns for Performance > I/O History and see if you can visually see which process is doing a heavy I/O load (or none at all) in addition to the CPU troubleshooting you're already observing.
Also do you have iTunes 10.5 already?  It significantly improved performance on Windows finally.
