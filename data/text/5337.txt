Q: Is it safe to upgrade all outdated port when upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion? My Mac running Snow Leopard has several MacPorts based open source software packages installed. Upon the upgrade to Lion, all my ports are listed as outdated. 
It's safe to upgrade them en masse?

A: macports.org currently says:
"Note for Lion users: There is no official release supporting Mac OS X 10.7 yet, but you can test the MacPorts 2.0.0 release candidate if you like."
I usually don't upgrade to a new major version of OS X until MacPorts has released their first official support for it.
I agree with Jerry Jacobs that you should probably back up your /opt hierarchy before attempting. Then you could try doing sudo port selfupdate to see if that upgrades you from 1.9.2 (or whatever) to the 2.0.0 release candidate.  If it does, then you can try sudo upgrade outdated.
I wouldn't try doing a sudo upgrade outdated on Lion without at least being on the 2.0.0 release candidate of MacPorts.

A: The best thing you can do is to copy the /opt/local directory to a other directory, and then upgrade everything you installed with macports. If it fails you still have your old ports in the backup directory.

A: I just upgraded to Lion yesterday. Port 1.9 stopped working until I upgraded Xcode to the newest version (4.1). After I upgraded Xcode, port (1.9) started working again.
