Q: MacBook Air Mid 2011: headphone plug makes weird noises If I turn a headphone plug around in the headphone jack, it makes really loud and weird creaking noises. I just want to make sure that my Macbook Air isn't the only one which does that.
I already had a close look into the jack, but nothing seems to be wrong with it.

A: There is no such sound coming from mine. Sorry to say this - but it sounds like you have a repair coming your way.
It might still just be the headphones though - have you tried with different sets??

A: That sounds like possibly the Inductor for your audio rail has gone bad, if you are competent with electronics you could locate the inductor on your board, schematics are widely available, with a multimeter you can measure the inductance, if its simply your inductor that has gone bad its a easy fix, have you tried it with any other headphone?
