Q: How to know which iOS apps are restricted to a country? I'm actually using an US iTunes account, but I'm interested in switching my country to another (as people suggest here) to my original country to be able to use my credit card (with address in my country).
The problem is that I may have apps only available in the US App Store, and probably I don't really care about those apps but I would like to know which are those apps to be sure if I could live without them.
Do you know how or where to check that?
If it's something automatic, would be great, but if I need to look each of my apps it's not a problem at all.

A: I don't know of anything automatic - but you can browse the iTunes store here:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/browse
This is the US store - if you browse to your app, and then replace the 'us' part of the URL with the country code for the store you want to check (e.g. 'fr' for france, 'ie' for Ireland, etc) - you'll either get brought to the entry for the App in that country, or get an error message that the app is not available.
I don't think you'll find a huge number of apps that aren't available.
If you use Apple TV, do consider that the films/TV choices in other stores may be much more limited.
You might want to consider keeping two accounts rather than changing. It can make management a little more inconvenient, but you'll have a bigger choice of things to buy/rent.

A: You can switch between accounts whenever you want. All the existing apps and data will remain on your iPhone when switching iTunes App Store account.
