Q: How do I stream Mac audio to Linux computer? is there any way to stream audio from my Mac to my Linux computer (my av receiver is connected to that)?

A: I think VLC can stream the audio over the network - take a look at http://www.videolan.org/doc/streaming-howto/en/ 

A: If you don't want to pay money for AirFoil, you can use SoundFlower on the Mac and ESounD or PulseAudio's ESounD-compatible module on the Linux machine. This article explains how to do that.

A: You can use AirFoil ($25) for Mac to stream the sound to AirFoil Speakers for Linux (free).
This software works great.

A: This guide worked for me http://tdotc.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/sound-matters/
Summary:
Install Soundflower in your Mac.
# open network port 16002 to receive raw data for PulseAudio (in your receiver)
while true; do nc -l 16002 | pacat --latency-msec=1; done

# connect the audio input on OS X to a remote raw sound sink via esdrec and netcat (in your Mac)
esd -tcp -bind ::1 & sleep 2 && esdrec -s ::1 | nc <SERVER> 16002


A: With XBMC installed on a Linux machine and without any other software on my Mac, I can stream anything I want.
To do this:


*

*Configure XBMC as an Airplay receiver : go to System > Services > Airplay and enable Airplay (I do not use password)

*On your Mac, Open Audio Midi Setup

*Right click on the Airplay item on the left side and choose “Use this device for sound output” from the Action pop-up menu.


Now, anything you play on your Mac should output to your Airplay device.
To reverse back to normal output (e.g. on a MacBook), right-click on another output (e.g. the standard speaker or integrated output) and choose “Use this device for sound output” from the Action pop-up menu.

A: Use ShairPort on the Linux box.
Everything can be setup within minutes with zero software installed on the Mac, which is what I wanted.
Install from PPA
This should work pretty straightforwardly on any Debian-based distro.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dantheperson/shairplay-sync
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install shairplay-sync

Install from source
These instructions are valid for Debian, and worked on my raspberry pi within minutes. Other distros/OS may need to adapt the packages to be installed.


*

*Install Alsa:
apt-get install alsa-utils alsa-oss libasound2 libasound2-plugins alsamixer


*Install PulseAudio:
apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils


*Install perl SDP. Follow instructions on the perl-net-sdp repo

*Clone & install ShairPort:
git clone https://github.com/hendrikw82/shairport.git
cd shairport
sudo make install
sudo cp shairport.init.sample /etc/init.d/shairport
sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/shairport
sudo update-rc.d shairport defaults


*(optional) Rename your receiver (like the room name):
vim /etc/init.d/shairport

Change/add the following:
DAEMON_ARGS=”-w $PIDFILE -a AirPlayName”


*Start all the services (PulseAudio, ShairPort, etc)

*You can now redirect your audio output to your new ShairPort device by alt-clicking the sound icon on your Mac.


All of these instructions were found on this blog post and copied here briefly in case the link goes down.
