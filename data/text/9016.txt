Q: How to backup iPhone to iTunes for the first time (data stored on the iPhone, not on iTunes) I've upgraded to Lion OS X on my MacBook a while ago, but never connected my iPhone to iTunes for quite some time, however, there is no backup data on my iTunes but my iPhone has everything I need it to be transferred and backed up to my iTunes, but I cannot do this because I wanted to sync my iPhone, iTunes gave me a warning:

If I click "Sync Apps", will my iPhone apps be wiped off? Thus, causing no backup data to my iTunes.
How can I transfer my iPhone data to my iTunes without iTunes wiping my iPhone with no apps stored on iTunes?

A: Yes, if you do a direct sync, your apps will be wiped out. You should transfer the apps to the new iTunes by doing this:

Files -> Transfer Purchases from iPod

This step should transfer your apps to iTunes. You can also see this Apple.SE post for a similar situation. After transfering purchases, you should then be able to sync with the new iTunes without losing your apps. The same situation holds for music.
