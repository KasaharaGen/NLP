Q: iPhone 4, only emergency calls I bought new Neverlock (sim free) iPhone 4 with 4.3.5 firmware. Then I would like to return it to factory settings and click "Restore" in iTunes. But after restoring i received unlocking device with "only emergency calls" message. What can i do now?

A: You bought one? From where? I ask because once you've restored in iTunes if it's a properly unlocked device it'll let you straight back in, emergency calls only means it's not been registered against a network, or unlocked.
