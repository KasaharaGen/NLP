Q: ipod touch apps won't start after update I updated my 3rd gen iPod Touch to 4.3.3, and now almost none of the apps will run - they appear to start, and then exit back to the desktop.
A double-tap on the home button shows them running, but switching to them produces the same results.
Is this a known issue?  Any way to fix it?

A: I would recommend following these steps to restore your iPod Touch: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1414
In short, when you connect your device, go to the device's Summary tab in iTunes and click the Restore button.  It should prompt you to back up your device first.

A: I encountered this problem, and it seems to be solved after entering the app store, and clicking Update All.
