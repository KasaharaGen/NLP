Q: Why my MacBook Pro 15" (2011) power adapter turns orange? I bought an early-2011 MacBook Pro 15" (highest-spec model) in June. It's running Lion.
I have a problem which happens occasionally. My power adapter (while plugged in) from time to time (particularly when I play games) turns orange and shows me on the bottom of the screen that there is "0:09" or "0:10" minutes left. However, when I push on the battery menu icon for the detailed information, it shows me "99% Full".

A: It could be that your battery is defective.
If you go to System Information > Power, what do you see under "Battery Information" - "Charge Information"?
Mine says:
Charge Information:
  Charge Remaining (mAh): 4693
  Fully Charged: Yes
  Charging: No
  Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 4744
Health Information:
  Cycle Count: 219
  Condition: Normal


A: I have read it somewhere before (here) that on some heavy loads (especially GPU loads), 2011 MacBook Pro charger may not supply enough charge. There are no official confirmations, though, as far as I know.
Please check, however, that the "0:09" minutes are referred to the remaining time and not the "remaining time until fully charged". I suppose it is the latter. 
I may also point out (but only as a last thought) that if you keep your Mac always under charge, the battery may stop charging at certain times to preserve lifetime. 

A: First, unlug your Mac and use it until the battery is at  2% or 3%. Then, shutdown your Mac and plug in again. After that battery should be fully charged.
