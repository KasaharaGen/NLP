Q: How to copy Apple Calendar Server data to a new installation? I have recently reinstalled my Mac Mini server. It was acting up after the upgrade from SLS to Lion Server, so I reinstalled with Lion.
I can't figure out how to properly migrate calendar data from the old installation.
I have tried copying /Library/Server/Calendar and Contacts/ from the old installation to the new one, but that makes no difference I can see. Can anyone help me figure out how to do it?
