Q: how do i access my @me.com email account I just set up a new @me.com email account through iOS5 beta and was wondering if there was a way to access through the web, or if anyone knew the imap server info. It looks like they are using some custom token system for auth on the phone.

A: At iCloud.com you can see your mail, calendar, etc :)

A: Go to iCloud.com and enter you full username and password ensuring you include@me.com e.g.. username@me.com

A: When you are in the iCloud.com, if you see findmyphone, just click the Cloud logo on the left of your "My Devices" and you should be directed to a main menu where you can access your mail calendar and all these
