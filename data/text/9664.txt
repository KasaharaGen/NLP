Q: How to disable Preview from opening up the last couple items viewed? osx lion When I download a PDF and open it in Preview on OS X Lion, Preview opens the last couple documents that I viewed. It seems to arbitrarily open anywhere from the last document to the last x documents.  
Does anyone know how to disable this feature?

A: To stop only Preview from doing this open up Terminal.app and enter:
defaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false

To re-enable this at any time enter:
defaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true

If you want to turn off the resume-on-load feature for all applications you can go to System Preferences -> General and at the bottom of the screen uncheck the option Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps to prevent any application from doing this.
