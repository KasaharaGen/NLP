Q: In Safari, is there any keyboard shortcut to *hide* the Web Inspector? In Safari, when the Develop menu is enabled, I can make the Web Inspector appear by hitting ⌘⌥I. However, when I hit that again, the Web Inspector stays where it is.
Is there any way I can hide it with another (or somehow the same) keyboard shortcut?

A: According to the apple website, there is no hide shortcut. Sorry.
