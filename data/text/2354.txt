Q: Transfer OS X Dashboard Widgets Between Computers Can anyone tell me an easy way to transfer my dashboard widgets from one OS X computer to another?  If there was a way to keep their positioning/settings too that would be great.

A: macOS does not have the /Users/[user]/Library/Widgets/ folder on a fresh install. Simply create the Widgets folder and place your widget file in it. Your widget will appear in the Dashboard.

A: Widgets are saved at /Library/Widgets/ and /Users/[user]/Library/Widgets/
If you copy /Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist that will copy your Dashboard configuration.
Each widget will have it's own configuration file in /Users/[user]/Library/Preferences/, for example widget-com.apple.widget.weather.plist
