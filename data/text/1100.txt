Q: How do I make a game controller an active input device on my Mac-mini? How do I make a game controller an active input device on my Mac-mini?

A: If you have a Playstation 3 controller, your Mac can recognize it as a bluetooth device and if you pair it with your computer you can set it up to be used as a game controller for your Mac.
I have only tried it with SNES9x, and it DOES work with that app. Playing Super Street Fighter with a wireless PS3 remote is pretty bad ass, I must say, haha. 
Not sure what else it would work with, but I am sure you could map the buttons and set it up to work with other games and services once you pair it.
Good luck!

A: Yeah, it might be an Snes9x issue; I had thought to try the controller with other programs (in part to see if it would work, in part just to play with it), but I hadn't downloaded any games for my NES simulator yet (Nestopia), and I couldn't get Steam to load (I'm not a gamer at all (any case anybody couldn't tell by my asking about simulators for old Nintendo consoles), but my sister had bought me a cheap game on Steam, though I hadn't played it much).  Just now, after Mark's reply, I decided to download a game for Nestopia, and when I checked its options I see it has a link to an emulator enhancer that allows it to work with controllers.  That same site had its own SNES simulator (the BSNES), so I downloaded that one, and my controller now works with both.  So, that's cool.  Thanks for your help, guys.
