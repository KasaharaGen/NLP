Q: adjust battery-warning-level of magic mouse How can I adjust the level at which Mac OS warns me about the battery of my magic mouse?
I always have a lack of batteries, so I would prefer if the battery warning comes up at 15 or 20%, so I could work the rest of the day with the almost empty batteries and put them in the charger before I go to sleep. 
Right now, if the warning occurs in the morning I have a problem.
I tried to steal the batteries out of my girlfriends camera or her wireless keyboard, but she does karate and defends her batteries.
Buying another set is not an option.
A way to get the battery level via applescript, shellscript, automator, whatever would be applicable too.

A: This thread has some scripts that can help you.
It seems that you wrap the results of this shell snippet in a nice AppleScript:
ioreg -c BNBMouseDevice | grep BatteryPercent


A: In my macOS Sierra 10.12.6, there is no BNBMouseDevice. Script which works for me is:
ioreg -c AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService -r -l | grep BatteryPercent | sed 's/[^[:digit:]]//g'
