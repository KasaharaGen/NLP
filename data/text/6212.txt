Q: Macbook Aluminum wakes up - Lion Updated I have recently updated my macbook with Lion. Now it keeps on waking up in my bag for some unknown reason. Here is what i get in the console.
An Unknown USB Device (Port 4 of Hub at 0x4000000), may have caused a wake by being connected
I'm not sure what is at the port 4 of Hub? Also what i have discovered is that my bluetooth module apparently is not connected!? What would cause this to happen?
This is from system info:

How do I find what is at port 4? Could it be bluetooth module?
