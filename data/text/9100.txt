Q: How can I stream all audio from my imac into a PC on the same network? I would like all iMac sounds to go through my network into my PC speakers. Is there an available solution for this?

A: Should be possible with AirFoil, but I've only personally used it to send audio between two Macs. They have a Windows version as well, though.
