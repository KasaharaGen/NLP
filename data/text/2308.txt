Q: What iPhone apps are available for sending bulk SMSs? What iPhone apps can I use for sending bulk SMSs?
Hopefully something very simple to get started with....

A: Built-in Group Messaging
On any iPhone with iOS 4 you can enable group messaging which will allow you to message a group and for responses to be sent to the whole group:


*

*Open Settings

*Tap Messages.

*Finally, flip the Group Messaging slider to On.


Other soltions include:


*

*Mass Text Message

*Beluga

*textPlus

A: MassTextMsg app in the app store.   The only one I found that is simple, pulls your contacts from you address book, and doesn't force you to sign-up for an account or a different phone number.
