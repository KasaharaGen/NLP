Q: How to copy paste Xcode warnings? Is there a way to copy paste the content of this warnings in Xcode ?


A: Yes.  If you go to the Issue Navigator (cmd-4), you'll see a list of build warnings and errors.  You can select one from the list and hit cmd-c.  You'll get something like this:

/Users/dave/Developer/Cocoa/EmptyFoundation/EmptyFoundation.m:180:15:{178:2-178:6}{178:2-178:7}: warning: conversion specifies type 'unsigned long long' but the argument has type 'NSUInteger' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wformat,7]


A: I know it's possible in Xcode 4.  Just click the warning (or error), then press Cmd ⌘-C to copy.  It will copy the file path as well, but the warning/error text will be at the end of the string.

A: Click on your error or select the section and on your Apple Keyboard, tap the following : ⌘ + C to copy it and ⌘ + V to paste it.
