How can I use NTFS partitions? 

Hi, I just bought a new external HDD, It went well on my PC but I can't delete/move files on it from my macbook.
PS. Im running OS X 10.5.8 on my macbook

A: You need to install 3rd-party software for this, by default OS X just support reading NTFS not writing.
download and install NTFS-3G and MacFUSES.
