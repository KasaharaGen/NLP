Q: How can I resize a window that doesn't have the grabbing part on the bottom right? I have Hulu desktop running and I want to make the window smaller, there are no lines which are usually present on windows for resizing on the bottom right corner, though. On windows I could right-click the title bar and choose size for these kind of windows, is there any way to do something similar on a Mac?
I tried pressing the green button on the top left, but that doesn't do anything.

A: Hard to find free softwares for this, I only found a donationware :


*

*Window Wrangler
Otherwise, you can have paid solutions :


*

*Cinch, which a nice and useful windows manager.

*MondoMouse

*Zooom/2

A: I use MercuryMover for move or resize windows with keyboard.
MercuryMover is a utility designed to help you keep your hands on the keyboard. Installed as a System Preferences panel, MercuryMover makes it possible to move and resize windows using just the keyboard.
