Q: How to convert .mdf/.mds to .iso? I have an old Alcohol 120% CD/DVD image file that I'd like to convert to an .iso image. I have tried simply renaming the file thus (disregarding the 4 KB .mds file):
video.mdf --> video.iso.
This sort of worked. Most of the video played perfectly (in VLC) but then the final three minutes were silent with a blank screen.
How should I go about doing this?

A: You can use very simple command line program mdf2iso for this.
it is available via MacPorts (for example).
PS: This utility can be also used in any Linux, *BSD and Windows systems

A: Handbrake is able to read quite a lot of video formats. It shares a bunch of libraries with VLC anyway so you may be able to convert your files as well. 

A: Another way, if you only need to mount the image, is to use DAMON Tools for Mac. Not free but if the trial expires it can be uninstalled/reinstalled using AppCleaner.
