Q: Is it possible to queue songs on the iPhone? I would like to queue up songs on my iPhone like I can on my desktop music player. Is this possible with iTunes, or is there an alternative music app that will let me do this?

A: You can create an on the go playlist directly on the iPhone that acts like a queue. Alternatively you could create a playlist in iTunes then import that to the iPhone by dragging the list to the phone icon. Any missing tracks would be imported.
