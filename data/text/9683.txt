Q: How can I make a file un-hidden permanently? I have some files that were hidden on a PC. Now they live on my Mac. How can I remove the hidden property on each of these files?

A: In Terminal defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE, relaunch  Finder. After that you'll see all your hidden files in Finder. 
Now type 
chflags nohidden

into Terminal and just drag&drop file that you want to unhide on the line. Enter.
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE will reverse Finder back to normal.
