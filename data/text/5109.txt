Q: Change Firefox tab-switching  keyboard  shortcut To move to the next tab in most browsers, you use ctrl+⇥.
Then, to close it, you have to reach over to ⌘+W.
I don't like switching modifier keys like that; I'd prefer to just use ctrl for both.
Is there a way to change the shortcuts so that both shortcuts use the control key? It would be great to switch this globally, but otherwise a solution for Firefox would be fine too.

A: This is the definitive answer. Here are two official FireFox add-ons (plugins) that let you modify or define your own keyboard commands and shortcuts.

A: This is not an exact answer to your question, but you can also use ⌘+1, ⌘+2 etc for visiting each tab, as well as ⇧+⌘+] or ⇧+⌘+[ to go to the previous/next tab.

A: If you go in to System Preferences, you can then choose "Keyboard & Mouse" where you will be able to re-wire shortcuts. I'm writing this from my iPhone, so I can't give you detailed instructions, but googling "mac change keyboard shortcuts" gave me lots of guides describing how to do it, among which this one from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2490#l4

A: I belive in Firefox you can use ⌥+⌘+←/→ to view the open tabs.

A: To change a keyboard shortcut that appears in an OS X application's menu:
System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts
Click the plus, and type the name of the command exactly as it appears in the menu, and choose a shortcut. (e.g. "Close Tab" and ⌘+W)
I would recommend, however, using the OS X standard for changing tabs, ⌘+⇧+[/], since you don't have to take your hands off home-row typing position. I believe it works for Firefox and most other tabbed applications.
