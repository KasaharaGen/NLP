Q: Running flash on MacBook Air V1 I run applications that use Adobe Flash.
This causes my MacBook Air (1st generation) to heat up and end up becoming unusable. 
Someone suggested running flash after creating a new Windows Partition, because Mac OS-X does not support Flash very well.
Will it help to run Flash that way?

A: I have found that Parallels and VMWare are painfully slow on a 1st gen MBA. You could use Chrome when you need Flash as it runs a browser-specific instance of Flash rather than calling the system Flash instance. Flash is very CPU-intensive so it may very well heat up the machine more than normal â€” I seem to recall mine always being pretty hot on the bottom.
John Gruber has a great article on removing Flash from OS X and then just using Chrome when you need it here - http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome

A: It's actually Flash that does't support OS X very well.
But simply running Flash can't make your MBA so hot, what kind of applications are you using with Flash that demand such huge heat-ups?
You could try installing a Windows partition, but I suspect that it won't lessen your problem.
I think your problem are the applications oyu are using with that laptop, as it doesn't have active cooling and can't handle too much CPU/GPU heat.
