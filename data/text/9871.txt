Q: Dual boot Linux and Lion on FileVault 2 disk I have Mac OS X Lion installed on FileVault partition. On the same disk I've installed GNU/Linux. When I boot my MacBook I can only boot Lion.
How to boot Linux?
In case you need here is more details about my setup.
MacBook Pro 13" (8,1) - MC724LL/A (2.7 GHz)

Microsoft Basic Data is in fact Linux Ext4 root partition, no idea why on diskutil listing looks like that.

A: Installing rEFInd and following the included instructions does work for me using OS X 10.8 with FileVault2 and Debian GNU/Linux using grub-efi.
In short: Use a protective MBR and install rEFInd to the efi system partition (esp) (use rEFInd's install.sh --esp). Rename the refind folder on the esp to BOOT and rename the efi file aswell to allow faster loading of rEFInd.
In Debian mount the esp, create a subdirectory debian in /efi/EFI, load the efivars kernel module and install grub-efi.
Make sure you read also the general instruction on that page regarding installation.

A: *

*First solution: In order to boot a Linux-Partition, download and install rEFIt: http://refit.sourceforge.net/ 
You should sync the partition tables afterwards.

*Second solution: Hold ⌥ while booting. Then choose Macintosh HD or Windows (=Linux in your case)


A: According to a blog post, I got refit to work with my filevault 2 encrypted macbook:

  
*
  
*Download rEFIt ( version 0.14 at this time ) on the official rEFIt website
  
*Open the .dmg file, but don’t run the bundled installer
  
*In the following steps, we’re going to mount the hidden EFI partition, copy and activate rEFIt:
  

    $ sudo mkdir -p /efi
    $ sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /efi
    $ cp -r /Volumes/rEFIt/efi/* /efi/EFI
    $ sudo bless --mount /efi --setBoot --file /efi/efi/refit/refit.efi --labelfile /efi/efi/refit/refit.vollabel


Note that the /efi/EFI folder already contains the Apple bootloader. If I where you, I wouldn’t remove it :-p
Note that rEFIt takes 25 second to show up.

That should allow you to select your linux boot partition
