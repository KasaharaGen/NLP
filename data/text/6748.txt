Q: How to capture a screen shot of all spaces Regularly I use more than 4 spaces in my Macbook Pro ( lion/10.7.1 ).
Can I get a screenshot of all spaces at one time ?

A: screencapture ~/Desktop/1.png
osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to key code 124 using control down' # ctrl-right
sleep 0.5
screencapture ~/Desktop/2.png
osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to key code 123 using control down' # ctrl-left
# montage ~/Desktop/1.png ~/Desktop/2.png -tile 2x1 -geometry +2+2 ~/Desktop/`date '+%y%m%d%H%M%S'`.png

montage comes with ImageMagick.

A: If you can get all Desktops to completely show on one screen, then yes.  That will be a trick that will make you famous.  8-)
I suspect the only such screenshot you can get of all spaces at once is to capture when using Mission Control.
You could cobble together a screenshot by combining the individual shots in Preview, or stitch them together with a photo app, and then taking a picture of the result.

A: I don't think so, but you can click F3, view all the desktops in the mission control, and then use Command-Shift-4 to capture that screenshot.
