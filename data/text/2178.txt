Q: Mac App Store works like trying to open iTunes via browser Greets everyone.
I've updated to 10.6.6 but my Mac App Store doesn't behave well - see screen below:

It seems to be constantly trying to open iTunes for some reason. BTW, I'd logged in iTunes with my Apple ID, but this didn't help.
Any ideas?

A: *

*Go to your home folder. (your user name under places on the left hand side)

*click on Library

*click on Preferences

*delete "ByHost" which is a folder. 

*delete "com.apple.appstore.appstore.plist" which is a file.

*delete "com.apple.storeagent.plist" which is also a file.

*restart

*empty trash

*open Mac App Store and it should work. 


If you're worried about deleting files then just make a copy somewhere else before you delete them.
