Q: DVD to iMovie converter for Mac 10.4.11 First of all, is there such a thing? All I want to do is be able to import film clips from DVDs into iMovie so I can make groovy youtube videos. Any suggestions for a Mac 10.4.11 user?

A: I use HandBrake. It's free and open, and works nicely.

A: You have so many choices on OS X. Here it goes, take a look at this tutorial link for your question answered step by step.
Other excellent (and easy!) software to use are:
-iRip it from The Little App Factory
-Permute from Fuel Collective
-iFlicks from Jendrick Bertram
I translated the last one in French for...French users ;)
Hope this will help you!

A: MacTheRipper also does a decent job of this, although the author makes it deliberately hard to get hold of. You need to join the forums at http://www.ripdifferent.com/forum to get download instructions.

A: Rip the DVD to an iMovie supported video format such as mov or mp4.
