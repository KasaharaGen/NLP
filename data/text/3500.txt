Q: Any way to make multiple files stop hiding their extension? How can I make multiple files show their extension at once? Any finder setting and/or terminal command would be nice.

A: Not sure what your goal is, but you make Finder show all extensions by default by selecting Show all filename extensions in Finder -> Preferences -> Advanced.
