Q: Add a second signature in iPhone/iPad Mail I have 2 email accounts on my iPhone and iPad, a work and personal.
I have edited a signature for my work account but can only seem to have one signature. 
I also use Mail.app on OSX which lets me change between accounts that automaticly reply/send with the correct signature.
The iOS app doesn't seem to match a signature to an account rather it looks as though it attaches the signature to the iPhone.
Is there a way to add another signature to Mail?

A: iOS only supports a single signature, but you can use iOS 5's new text Shortcut feature to manage multiple signatures. The feature is in the Settings app under "General | Keyboard | Shortcuts".
Add a shortcut for each signature, e.g. wsig = Work Signature and psig = Personal Signature
Shortcut only supports single lines of text, so I get around this by having my default sig be my name plus a new line, then I type the shortcut text on the blank line after my name.
