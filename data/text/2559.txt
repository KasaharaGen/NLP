Q: Anyone know when iOS 4.3 is due to come out? Anyone know when iOS 4.3 is due to come out?
I'm hoping to buy an iphone and use the wifi 'tethering' feature that apparently is part of ios 4.3 to replace our home internet connection, and am wondering when this is coming out?
Thanks all

A: It will be released when Apple feels like it's ready. It's anyones guess at this point. Apple almost never gives out release dates for it's products.
Like IntuitionGQ said, you can always Jailbreak it
