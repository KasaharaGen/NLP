Q: how do I access iTunes Visualizer options? I'm using iTunes 10.4 and under "menu > View > Visualizer >" there are two options, "iTunes Visualizer" or "iTunes Classic Visualizer" there's also a greyed out "Options..." menu.
The last time I used visualizer (a while ago) there were several cool visualizers to choose from like plasma shapes, and bouncing balls, and stuff.  I don't see any of that here.
Where are these options?  Were they removed?  And why is "Options..." greyed out?
Thanks!

A: Have you upgraded to Lion?
As per this support thread it seems the extra visualizers require 32-bit mode:

Right click on iTunes.app in your Applications folder and click "Get Info". In the window that appears, click "Open in 32-bit mode" at the bottom of the "General" pane.
This is a work-around, not a fix, and I have filed a bug report with Apple.
