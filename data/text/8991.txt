Q: How do I reset Apple's Mail, in Lion, to default settings? I have been having a bunch of email problems and want to start over.  I have deleted all the IMAP accounts from Mail.  What other files do I need to delete, hidden and otherwise, to make Mail (and only Mail) just like a clean install?

A: The following directories should be empty:


*

*~/Library/Mail

*~/Library/Mail Downloads

*~/Library/Application Support/Mail

*~/Library/Caches/Mail

*~/Library/Caches/com.apple.mail
The following files should be removed:


*

*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist*

*~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.mail.savedState

A: In addition to the folders mentioned by Patrix, I discovered that Apple Mail (at least the OS X 10.9 Mavericks version) is using another folder, at:
...../Library/Containers/com.apple.mail
After I had tried to do a clean restart of Mail by disabling (re-naming) all the folders that I thought that it was using (and having done a Force-Quit of the process "cfprefsd" in my username, to further reset caches), my Mail froze on trying to start up.
When I also disabled the folder in Library/Containers, the Mail application was able to start up.
