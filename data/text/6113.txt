Q: How to join audio tracks into a single audiobook? I am looking for a solution to join entire CD to a single audio file, preferably with chapterizing functionality.
Usually, Join Toghether should do the job but this solution doesn't work anymore with Lion and I am looking for a solution that works with Lion.
I mention that most of my files are in AAC Lossless format and I don't want to convert them to something worse. I tried Audiobook Builder but it seams to not be able to build lossless files.

A: Rogue Amoeba's Fission will do what you want. It costs US $39 but it has a limited trial demo you can download. It is a lightweight lossless audio editor. The publisher reports no compatibility problems with Lion.

A: Instructions for this are documented on my blog:

Uses open-source or free software, and the command line.

A: My personal choice for all audio editing is Sound Studio. I acquired it in its Freeverse days, but it is now distributed by its developers, Felttip. It's priced at $29.99, and is available on the Mac App Store, with a 15-use demo download available from the Felttip site.
It's only now, while checking links for this answer, that I see it's now reached Version 4 (I've been using 3 for some time, and do not recall receiving notification of upgrade availability). My experience with Version 3 has been unchanged since upgrading to Lion.
