Q: How do I move a contact on the iPhone from one group to another? I have about 20 contacts on my iPhone that is in the wrong group. How can I move them to another group?

A: Orbicontacts worked very well for me, and it is free

A: I have been using Copytrans Contacts - the difference between this app and I would say most of the rest is that:


*

*You can use it to add/edit/remove contact groups on your iPhone via your computer





*

*You can easily move iPhone contacts between groups via drag/drop




A: The Speed Names app will do it. How could they have missed doing this in iOS 5?
All those clever people at Infinite Loop and no one wants to move a contact from one group to another? Or perhaps they have no friends?

A: I had the same problem. I found this page looking or a solution. I wasn't satisfied with the above. So I did the following:


*

*Email the contacts to yourself (share contact).

*In the contacts app, make sure you are in the proper group (for me, my gmail account with exchange)

*Import the contact. It should be adde to the group you selected in the previous step. 

*Now go check the contact is in the correct group, and if so, delete the one in the old group.


A: it will work to email yourself the contacts but you need to be sure to first go to the settings menu/mail,contacts,calendar/look down the menu under contacts for default account and set it to exchange.  then it will save the contacts you email yourself in exchange.

A: You need to use your AddressBook application for that and sync the iPhone again.
There is no Group support but for reading on iOS.


*

*you can't create groups

*you can't move to and from groups

*you can only create a contact in a group if a group exists
－ Windows user can edit your group through iCloud.com/contacts

A: There are several apps that can do this, for example VisuContacts.

A: ContactMover costs $4.99 and EasyGroup crashes. Though the interface is terrible, HachiContact works and is free. Oh, and it hasn't crashed on me yet.
I've been able to add groups, remove groups, and even move contacts between groups. I still don't understand why this functionality isn't built into the iPhone OS.

A: The [ContactMover][1] iPhone app does this. [1]: http://www.immense.net/contactmover/

A: This is similar to Jason's answer but quicker as it's more integrated.
You'll need two Apple devices (such as an iPhone and an iPad or possibly a Mac).  I've gone into details but it's actually easy and reliable.
In the following instructions we'll be moving contact(s) from source group 'A' (selected on the iPhone) to target group 'B' (on the iPad).  It doesn't matter which device is used for what role; in the end, both devices can still show contacts from both groups, if so desired.

*

*Ensure iPhone and iPad both have Bluetooth enabled. On both devices go to Settings -> General -> AirDrop and ensure either "Contacts Only" (or "Everyone") is selected.

*iPhone: open Contacts, click on 'Groups' (top left) and select only group 'A'; do the same thing on the iPad but select only group 'B'.

*iPad: go to Settings -> Contacts and make sure group 'B' is set as "Default Account".

*iPhone: select a contact you want to transfer, tap "Share Contact", then select your iPad with the AirDrop symbol (blue circles over white background).

*iPad: click "Save" on the top right hand corner of the contact card that has just appeared.

*(optional but advisable): iPhone, click 'Edit' on top-left of the contact card you have just transferred, scroll to the bottom of the card, press 'Delete' and confirm deletion.  If you don't do this, you'll end up with duplicates (one in each group 'A' and 'B').

*Repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 ad nauseam.

Once you're done transferring the contacts, you may re-select the groups you care about in the Contacts app of both devices (step 2).  It may also be worth checking that the Default Account (step 3) is set to something sensible on all your devices if you find that new contacts land in the wrong group.
These instructions refer to iOS 15; this likely works similarly on older and newer versions.

A: I am using a free iPhone application to manage groups of contacts.
