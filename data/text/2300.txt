Q: Leopard Mail app keyboard shortcut I've recently switched to Chrome for developing and have thus started using the build-in Developer Tools instead of my previously preferred Firebug workflow. Just today I found a keyboard shortcut (Command-Shift-I) that jumps straight to Inspect Element rather than just opening the Developer Tools like Command-Option-I does.
The problem I'm having is that this shortcut also opens the Mail app, which I do not use. I've looked in the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences and I don't see the aforementioned shortcut anywhere. Anybody know where I can disable this shortcut?

A: Command + Shift + C  Will open up the inspector, and let you click an object to Inspect.

A: hotkeys for Chrome on Mac OS X (from here):


*

*Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + I to open Developer Tools

*Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + J to open Developer Tools and bring focus to the Console.

*Command ⌘ +  Shift ⇧ + C to toggle Inspect Element mode.
