Q: Thunderbolt -> Triple Monitor Mac Mini? It seems the new Mac Mini uses both HDMI and Thunderbolt, but bandwidth limitations of Thunderbolt may prevent using 3 daisy-chained Thunderbolt high resolution monitors such as the newly released Apple Thunderbolt 27" Display, limiting you to two instead of three.
If this correct:
1. What occurs to the 3rd monitor in a triple daisy-chain? Black screen? Reduced available resolution up to the bandwidth limit of Thunderbolt?
2. Are there HDMI to mini-displayport adapters for connecting the HDMI output of the Mini to the Thunderbolt input of an Apple Thunderbolt 27" Display? Would that even work?  

A: If you get the Mac Mini with the AMD graphics it can support three monitors.
From MacRumors

Mac mini (Mid 2011): Two Thunderbolt displays. Mac mini with AMD graphics can support a HDMI compatible device on its HDMI port when using two Thunderbolt displays. 


A: The limitation is not in the Thunderbolt, but in your graphic card.
I believe the third display will have a black screen if you don't have enough power from your graphic card.

A: Apple recently posted a knowledge base article on this subject.
The bottom line is there is no currently available Mac that can power more than two thunderbolt displays. You may be able to use third-party hardware extensions to increase this number.
