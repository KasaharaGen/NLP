Q: What is the best widget for song lyrics? I'm looking for a widget that can


*

*Show the lyrics of the current playing song

*Get the lyrics online if there is none on the music, and save it

*Nice designed


I used to use the Harmonic widget, but it seems it was abandoned

A: SaveThoseLyrics (Freeware)
It looks like it does the same thing as Harmonic.
LyricSearch (Free)
Allows you to search for lyrics by song. (Don't think this is what you are looking for)
Canto Pod (Free)
Allows you to search for a song, then add it to your iTunes library. (Don't think you are looking for this either)
LyricSearch and Canto Pod were lyrics widgets that I found. As I already said, I don't think that's what you are looking for, but I put them there in case you did want to search by song, rather than the current iTunes song. I hope this helps you out.
