Q: Scrolling Settings - "Throw" I was trying to change my scrolling settings to keep the screen from scrolling when I take my hands off the touchpad.  Right now, if I do a two-finger scroll, and take my fingers off the pad while keeping my hand moving, the screen continues to scroll, like a throw.  I would like this behavior to stop.
I have a MacBook Pro running Leopard
Thanks!

A: You can remove the inertia for the two fingers scroll, just select "without inertia" under Trackpad inside the System Preferences :


A: In your Trackpad system preferences panel, under Two Fingers, change the "Scroll with Inertia" option. That should stop it.
