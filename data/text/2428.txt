Q: Are There Any Text Browsers for iOS? I want a text-only browser on my iPod. It is not jailbroken (nor do I wish to do so), and it is running iOS 4.2.1. Does anyone know of a way to install any text browser on iOS without jailbreaking? Any of these text browsers would be awesome;
Lynx, Edbrowse, w3m, Elinks, Links, Emacs/W3, Net-Tamer, WebbIE, etc

A: You could go on your iPod to a website like http://pizzaseo.com/tool-lynx.php to emulate the behavior.

A: You could use Atomic Web Browser and turn on Web Compression (uses Google mobilizer). This should leave you with a minimum of graphics on the page.
