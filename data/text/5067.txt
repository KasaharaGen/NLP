Q: How can I change a filetype’s “Kind” value in the Finder? There are several filetypes that get a generic “Kind” description (if viewed in Finder’s List View) based on the program used to open them.  
I’d like to add descriptions for some file extensions so that they are not of the Kind “[editor] document”.  
Is this possible?
If so, how?

A: /path/to/default/app/Contents/Info.plist → CFBundleDocumentTypes → CFBundleTypeName:
<key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>
<array>
    <string>adb</string>
    <string>ads</string>
</array>
<key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>
<string>ADA</string>
<key>CFBundleTypeName</key>
<string>ADA source</string>

Modifying files inside application bundles invalidates the code signature and changes aren't necessarily respected by updates.
