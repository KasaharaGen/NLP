Q: Software/utility to completely erase cookies/cache What software (or using any other in-built tools) can I use to clear (by clear, I mean scrub from the disk) the cache & cookies in browsers, without affecting the bookmarks etc. I use firefox 4.
Does deleting them from the browser and running disk util to write zeros on the free space do the trick? Also, this is a shared laptop, so not much chance of drastic steps.

A: The easiest way is to use a free (or paid) utility to do it for you.
Onyx is a free one that does the job, you have an option to clear your browser's different values: 

Cocktail is a paid ($14.95) nice utility too, that does what Onyx does and the UI is a little bit more elegant and give you some more flexibility:

Of course, you will have to make sure that you securely empty your thrash if you really want to make sure nobody has access to deleted stuff. 
Cocktail has a nice option that may interest you in this regard:

â€¦which should cover your secure concerns :) 
(if OnyX has a secure delete, I couldn't find it in the preferences).

A: I have used Cocktail for many years and I am quite happy with it. It has many other useful features.
