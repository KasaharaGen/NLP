Q: How do I edit Managed Client preferences without them getting replaced? Specifically I would like to edit com.apple.applicationaccess.new.plist. (Which is in /Library/Managed Preferences/[username]/), but when I restart the computer my edited preferences are replaced with the old version.
How do I go about editing them for good? I only have command line access via SSH.

A: Turns out that the master copy of com.apple.applicationaccess is kept in /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/[user].plist. Editing that solved the problem for me. Thanks to Lyken for helping me find this on this question.

A: Managed preferences are set up by the administrator of the Open Directory / Active Directory, so short of unbinding your mac from all of these servers, you will have to live with the changes imposed on that mac or keep changing them when you log in.
Do you really need to stay connected to the servers if they are making changes you can't get them to reverse?
Launchd would be a good tool for you to add a script that makes those changes for you when you log in, but that's just automating a workaround and not resolving the issue. Similarly, launchd can be used to implement Managed Preferences on boot as described in this short video seminar. You might have to check into launchd on the mac to see if someone implemented a similar restriction using Workgroup Manager.
