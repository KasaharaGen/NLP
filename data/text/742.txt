Q: Create new file from contextual menu Is there a program I can download to add an option to create a new file to the contextual menu of finder? NuFile doesn't seem to work in Snow Leopard.

A: If you are happy using a toolbar button instead of the contextual menu, you can use New Text File Here from Jonas Wisser. Just drop it into Finder's toolbar.
Note: As of OS X 10.11.4 this program no longer seems to be working.

A: Path Finder also adds a contextual option for creating new files, but it's shareware.  Lots of other cool feature though.

A: New File Applescript with Toolbar Icon
Found this open source gem. Can either use the .App or add the Applescript manually. Will add a New File widget to the Finder toolbar.


A: This also works pretty well if you're willing to spend a bit of money:
