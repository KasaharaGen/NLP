Q: Are there any free alternatives to finder? Relatively new to the Mac world, I still find the 'Finder' not really that user friendly.
What free alternatives to Finder exist?
*I mean really file browsers, not application launchers like Quicksilver, Launchy etc..

A: muCommander is a free Finder alternative, if that type of application suites you. (Dual-pane Norton Commander like).

A: I don't know the good free alternatives, but PathFinder is the best file manager I have ever used, and probably one of the best desktop apps I've ever used. The features I use most


*

*Bookmarks and multiple tabs

*Multiple panes 

*Side panes with folder shortcuts

*Drop stack


Most importantly, it's not clunky (relatively) and is very reliable. It was worth every cent I paid for it.

A: Here's some free alternatives
Xfolders and MuCommander are free.

A: Another free alternative is xtrafinder http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/

A: Moroshka file manager (free) - in beta, however, but it may suit your needs: 
I have not yet used it, so offered under advisement (no reflection on product, though!)

A: Finder uses spaces and sub-spaces to organize our information. An alternative or a complementarity would be the use of TIME to organize our information. Here is a video presentation : hipSpace 
Edit: ok, I am the developer of hipSpace, but my app really answers to that question. Just "Save asâ€¦" your files in the "hipSpace" folder, that all ! When there are too much files in the space, Release them. It will be easy to retrieve them using the Time navigation (rather than the space navigation of the Finder).
