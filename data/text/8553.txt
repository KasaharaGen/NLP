Q: Transfer Videos From iOS5 Device to Computer Wirelessly: Possible? It seems that the majority of my device's content can now sync wirelesslly to my computer either via wifi sync or iCloud photostream.  Notably, photostream does not encompass videos.
Is there a way to transfer videos from your iOS5 camera roll to your computer wirelessly, or does this still require a hard line, cable transfer?*
*I tried to get around this using Dropbox sync over wifi, but the 4S's HD videos were too large for the Dropbox app to handle.  

A: I haven't tested it with videos, but I've had some decent results using PhotoSync. I think it's $2 or $3 on the app store, with a free Mac side client. Transfers photos and videos to/from your iOS library wirelessly without using iTunes. It also supports albums in iOS 5.

A: The Eye-fi app does this, but it requires you have an Eye-fi account, which requires you purchase an eye-fi card.  They can be had relatively inexpensively now.
An advantage with eye-fi device, though, is that all your pictures and videos will end up on your computer, whether taken with your camera or iOS device(s), automatically.  It's a decent solution for getting everything from several camera sources into one spot.
The app is free, but you have to purchase the eye-fi device to get the account that will enable your iOS device to transfer its own photos and video automatically.  Shopping around, you'll probably find one for around $50.
