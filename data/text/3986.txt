Q: Will an Apple Airport router work better with my Macs? I recently upgraded from Windows to a Mac, and now I have two Macbooks. Would they work better with my wireless if I got an Apple Airport a/b/n router? (I couldn't find anything about this on Google or anywhere else.) 

A: It's not so much that AirPort routers will work "better", but I can guarantee that setup of AirPort routers when using Mac computers is much easier than other routers.  The AirPort Utility really makes setup a breeze!
This comes from years of experience as a network admin and having personally owned/used at least one of just about every major brand of home router.  If you can afford an AirPort router, you won't regret the purchase.

A: The Apple Airport router will work better in the sense that it allows you to use some additional features, including "Wake on Demand" (included with Snow Leopard):

The Wake on Demand feature of Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard lets your Mac continue to share items (such as music, printers, files, or your screen) when it is asleep.
