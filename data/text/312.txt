Q: MobileMe on iPod Is it possible to change the default myname@me.com address to by myname@mac.com?
I'm part of a lot of mailing lists with the "mac.com", but iPod seems to send email with "me.com" ...

A: If you had @mac.com before and have same name @me.com ->mac.com is aliases of your me.com account
If you have only @me.com account you cannot

A: If you set up that account with @mac.com in the Apple ID section - it will default to that domain rather than @me.com.
