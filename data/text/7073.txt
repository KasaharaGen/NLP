Q: How do I disable the Control+Shift+Down Arrow Hotkey? I have a new Macbook Air with Lion and I'm using Excel in VMWare Fusion and it has a hotkey for Control + Shift + Down Arrow. 
Every time I try and use this key combination instead of doing what it's supposed to do for Excel it's getting intercepted by Lion. 
Is there a way to disable this hotkey globally or perhaps just when I'm using Fusion?

A: To reassign the key globally, go to System Preferences » Mission Control and under Application Windows, where it currently says ^↓, assign another key (I used F10, à la exposé).

A: To remove the shift augmentation follow the steps outlined in this answer to a similar (but with much less Google juice it seems) question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115698
