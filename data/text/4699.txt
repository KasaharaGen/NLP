Q: Is there any network monitor software with a notification area icon? I often use my laptop in the subway / office buildings where internet connection may be laggy / absent for some period of time. Is there any network monitorying software that can constantly monitor my network connection quality (for example, by sending ping to google.com every few second) and display a green-yellow-red icon in the notification area so I will know if i have a normal internet connection or not?
Google search doesn't show any such software :(

A: Try PingMenu: https://github.com/kalleboo/PingMenu


A: One solution is to use GeekTool. You'll need to write a small shell script, which would be a separate question.

A: I fully agree with @mankoff. Using GeekTool would definitely work for this situation. Even though you have lots of windows open there is a setting on GeekTool for keeping it above all windows. 

This is how you would make the script stay on top of all windows in the GeekTool interface.
GeekTool is the perfect choice for this situation although you would have to write a shell script as @mankoff said. You will find a great article on getting started with GeekTool here: An article from App Storm on GeekTool.
Here is the website for GeekTool. There, you will find the download button: GeekTool's website
What version operating system are you running?
@zzz said this about the shell script for GeekTool: "The 'shell script' for GeekTool would be "ping -c 1 -W 1 8.8.8.8""

A: Dashboard widget:

Or, what is wrong with opening Terminal.app, and run
ping 8.8.8.8

and reduce terminal app to 5 line high... :)
If you want, you can make the Terminal window:


*

*translucent

*sticky

*float above other apps


with the http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/
so, you will get exactly what you want... ;)
If you save the ping into ping.command, you can start it with doubleclick. etc..etc..
