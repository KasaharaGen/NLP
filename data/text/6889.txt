Q: Sync iCal and contact with Windows Mobile 6.5 in OSX Lion How can I sync iCal and Address Book with Windows Mobile 6.5 in OS X Lion? 
I would prefer a simple solution. I very much don't want this information on the Internet and am willing to wait for my Windows Mobile to be in the same location as my mac for syncs to happen.
I have tried The Missing Sync but it does not support Lion.
