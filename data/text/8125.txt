Q: After iOS 5 update can't open Photos.app Camera works and stores somewhere photos. But I can't open Photo.app...
I have tried many things to solve this problem:


*

*Quiting Photo.app

*iPhone restrat

*iPhone restore


Image Capture doesn't sea any photos as well.
All the same.
Do you have any ideas how to troubleshot this.
Thank you in advance.

A: Symptoms of what happens when you attempt to open the iOS Photos app would be helpful in troubleshooting this issue. If it opens and then immediately closes, it's crashing. If you've tried an actual restore of the OS, the only way that app will continue to crash is if you continue to restore from the backup, which will preserve the problem. Restore the unit, decline restoring from the backup, and test further.
