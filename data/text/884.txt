Q: How I can save a screenshot of an iPhone application? I want to take a screenshot of an iPhone or iPad application to share.
How is that accomplished?

A: Press the home button and the sleep button simultaneously. Newer phones have the sleep,on the side instead of the top but save images the same. 
This will save a picture of the current iPhone screen to the "Photos" application. From there, you can either email it to anyone you want or sync it to your computer.

Assistive touch also works on newer iOS versions.

On iOS 11 screen recording might be if use for capturing transient events where your reflexes or the device itself isnâ€™t responsive enough at the correct moment.
