Q: Do you still need to convert video for iPhone 4 (and now iPod Touch) Short of the filetype (alot of what I have I don't believe is supported by either device) Do I need to convert movies specifically for them? Or can I load them as is?

A: iTunes will convert some file types for you. For those you want to convert yourself (custom resolution, bitrate, etc) I like to use Handbrake. I'm also experimenting (right this moment actually lol) with AVIDemux. 
But to answer your question, I guess it depends on what the original file type is. Here is the spec sheet from Apple.

Video formats supported: H.264 video
  up to 720p, 30 frames per second, Main
  Profile level 3.1 with AAC-LC audio up
  to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in
  .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats;
  MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by
  480 pixels, 30 frames per second,
  Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to
  160 Kbps per channel, 48kHz, stereo
  audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file
  formats; Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) up to 35
  Mbps, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames
  per second, audio in ulaw, PCM stereo
  audio in .avi file format


A: Try an app called OPlayer. It plays just about anything, straight from a webserver or  iTunes file transfer.

A: PunyVid
Converts videos specifically for iPhone/iPod.

A: There is an iphone-app called yxplayer that can play many more video formats than are supported natively by iTunes/iPod/iPhone. However, playback often judders, the UI is quite minimalistic, and it does not remember last playback position etc.
