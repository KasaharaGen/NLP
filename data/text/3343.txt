Q: Edge resizing on Mac Finder windows? One of the few ways I think Windows beats the Mac is in letting the user resize a window from any edge or corner, not just from the bottom-right corner. 
I haven't found any software that enables this functionality on the Mac. Does such a thing exist?

A: Afloat, a free product by Infinite Labs, will let you resize a window by pressing âŒ˜ + Control + Right Click.  Divvy would also work, but Afloat is a free solution.

A: One of the new features that arrived in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the ability to resize a window from any edge.

A: I know you are looking specifically for edge resizing, but one option would be to use software that lets you set up predefined window sizes/locations that you can apply to a window.
For example, Divvy lets you create presets or drag your mouse against a small grid to locate the window.  I'm just getting started with it but it seems useful.

A: Although this does not answer the OP's actual question (namely, resizing from window edges), since Afloat ended up been mentioned, I wanted to point out another app similar in purpose to Afloat is Zooom/2.  It has the advantage of letting you choose the key bindings for resize (and other) behaviors it implements.  It's not free, but it works.  (I've used both Zooom/2 and Afloat, and have no ties whatsoever to any of the developers.)
