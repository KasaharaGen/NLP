Q: Mac ports installation of gcc46 failing due to architecture problems When trying to install gcc46 on OS X 10.6.4 using port (MacPorts 1.9.1) i get the following errors:
artemis:foo$ sudo port install gcc46
Error: Cannot install gcc46 for the arch(s) 'x86_64' because
Error: its dependency gmp is only installed for the arch 'i386'
Error: and the configured universal_archs 'ppc i386' are not sufficient.
Error: Unable to execute port: architecture mismatch

MacPorts was freshly installed on the 10.6 system.
Any suggestions on how to resolve this or how to install gcc46 for i386?
(Previously asked and as of now unanswered on SuperUser.)

A: For some reason the universal_archs configurations was wrong. An answer on SuperUser now worked:


*

*in /opt/local/etc/macports/ copy macports.conf.default to macports.conf

*make sure universal_archs in it is set to x86_64 i386

*now go for clean installs, e.g. by following the migration instructions

A: Try installing first gmp only with the universal variant :

sudo port install gmp +universal

Then reinstall gcc46.
