Q: OS X Lion multiple Spaces annoyance I like to set my desktops a certain way for work.
I noticed that when I command-tab around my Spaces, it seems to switch around the order of desktops when I access with ctrl+arrow.
This is really annoying. For example I set my two terminal and coding/debugger screens to be adjacent, then I alt-tab to my email and all of a sudden the email screen is sitting between my two work screens.

A: Did you try checking the obvious?
