Q: When Organized by Conversation, Mail's Inbox sometimes sends out to wrong recipient When Lion's Mail Inbox is set to "Organize by Conversation", an odd behavior often occurs. If I hit Reply to the latest email from my correspondent, the recipient in the new email is me, not this correspondent. 
I'm aware that any of the emails in the Conversation can be individually highlighted (seen as a blue line around that email), and that if this blue line is around one of the correspondent's emails, hitting Reply definitely sets the new email to be sent to this correspondent. However, if nothing is blue-highlighted, and I hit Reply, the new email is set to be sent to... me. Which of course isn't the objective.
Whew, that was harder to explain than the issue, but I hope my question is clear!

A: There are at least half a dozen threads on Apple Support about this, and was a bug that has been fixed as of 10.7.2. 

A: when the individual message is highlighted (as you said the blue box around that message), move the mouse to the separator line between the header and the message body, there is a float toolbar appear, hit the reply button there.

Meanwhile, Mail.app will organize all related message in the Conversation mode (as set in the preference), so the message you sent out (in the Sent box) will appear in the conversation.  So, if the message you sent is the 1st message in the conversation, when you hit reply without any message highlighted, Mail.app will set sent to.... you.
