Q: Can I convert a HFS+ volume to HFSX (case sensitive) without extra software tools? After upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion with added volume encryption along the way, my boot partition wasn't case sensitive any more. Is there a way to convert it back to being case sensitive without reformatting? I know that iPartition claims to be able to do this, but I'm a little hesitant to shell out money for a tool that I'd probably use exactly once.

A: Sadly, no. 
Your money or your time surely will soon be spent.
