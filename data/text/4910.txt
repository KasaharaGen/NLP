Q: How can I prevent iPhoto from opening everytime I plug my iPad/iPhone? How can I prevent iPhoto/Photos/Image Capture from launching everytime I plug in my iPad/iPhone?

A: The way disable this in bulk using terminal or a script:
defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool YES

This sets a flag to tell the system to not activate ImageCapture or Photos or iPhoto when a hot plug of an iOS device is detected. The benefit here is you pre-emotively disable the connection as opposed to reacting to each single device after an app has launched and the specific device is connected.

A: Do this:


*

*Plug in your iPad/iPhone

*Open Image Capture

*Select your device ("devMikePad")

*Press the triangle in square symbol in the lower left corner.

*Select "No application" in the menu.


Here is a picture showing what to look for on Snow Leopard or Yosemite.


A: iPhoto:
Preferences > General > "Connecting Camera Opens ..."
set it to "No Application"
added:  How to do this with the new Photos app
Connect the iPad/iPhone
Photos:
Import
check or uncheck "Open Photos for this device"  

A: On Yosemite, it was driving me nuts and the above answers helped some, but I still had to dig around a bit. Here's my own clarification:
Connect your phone and open Photos.


*

*Drop down the View menu and

*Select Show Sidebar (changing the option to Hide Sidebar as shown in my screenshot)

*Select your phone in the now visible sidebar and uncheck the box labeled "Open photos for this device"


I looked through all preferences, settings, and help menus I could find and found nothing. So thanks for the help!
