Q: Can I override the error AutoCAD gives about my older video card? I have a macbook 2,1 upgraded to 4GB ram and 500 GB hard drive. When installing AutoCAD, it complains that i have an older video card. Granted, that is true, I only use autocad for 2d purposes only. Is there a way to override that error?

A: Thanks to Asmus's suggestion I found that if you remove your graphic card's model from the file unspt_gfx_cards you can install AutoCad. So to recap:


*

*Copy the .mpkg package out of the DMG file to some place like your Desktop

*Right click on the package and select 'Show Package Contents'

*Browse to Contents/Resources/unspt_gfx_cards

*Right click unspt_gfx_cards and open with textedit

*Remove all lines that contain Intel or GMA(for your macbook) and save

*Double click on the .mpkg to install without hardware restrictions


Not sure if you will have any problems running Autocad but at least you should be able to install it.

A: Yes, that would work but you still won't be able to use it as it will give a WHIP error.
Solution: Buy a new i5/i7 Mac, or use BootCamp to boot into Windows XP or 7 and run from there.
