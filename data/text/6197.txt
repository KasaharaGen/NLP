Q: iPhone 3G 4.2.1 Unlock Is there any way I can unlock an iPhone 3G with Firmware 4.2.1 and baseband 05.15.04?
I correctly installed Cydia and Ultrasn0w (under iOS 4.1.2 or something like that if I remember right) via JailbreakMe 2.0.
The Unlock seemed to work, but I accidentally updated to 4.2.1.
Is there any way I can fix this?

A: How about the legitimate way through AT&T:

A: You can find out how to jail break and unlock your 3G on mac here. You may need SHSH blobs, but I didn't see where in the tutorial. I think SHSH blobs are only for downgrading.
