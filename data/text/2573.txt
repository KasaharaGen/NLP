Q: deactivate growlmail rss notification Is it possible to tell growlmail to stop notifying me on RSS feeds and just show me the new mails I get?
It is getting really disturbing when I get some 30 or more RSS Notifiers when I'm working!

A: If you want just notifications on the new mails you have in your Inbox(es), then there is a setting for that in GrowlMail configuration tab. Not in Growl System Preferences, but in Mail.app Growl Mail preferences.
