Q: Rhapsody + Mac OS X I've been using the music service Rhapsody for over a month now, and I really like it on my iPhone.  Unfortunately, I spend most of my time in front of my computer, programming.  I'm kind of so-so on the web client for Rhapsody, and I particularly would like to be able to download songs to my Mac.  I don't have access to a (legally obtainable) copy of any version of Windows, so VirtualBox/Parallels/etc. is out.  Wine doesn't really work with the Windows Rhapsody client.  Has anyone else encountered and/or solved this problem?  Switching from Rhapsody to some other service isn't really an option either, since so far, at least, no other "all-you-can-eat" music service has an iPhone app with downloading allowed.

A: Spotify has all that, but I’m not sure if you can use it in your country. Have you tried it?
UPDATE I found out that you’re in the USA, and Spotify only works in a few European Countries… unless you’re a “Premium” user; the catch is that you need to create your account from within Europe. I.e.: if you are european and want to travel, you can “take your music with you”… if you’re not a free user. Otherwise you can only use Spotify for 14 days until you return to your country.  sorry about that.

A: What about Napster? They have an iPhone and a web client and their pay scheme and service is similar to Rhapsody:
