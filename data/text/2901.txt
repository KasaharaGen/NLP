Q: Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts? Is it possible to connect a single Dropbox Mac app with two or more Dropbox accounts?
Assume I have corporate and private account. How can I use a single dropbox app for them?

A: You can't do it out of one copy of the app, but it seems that you can duplicate the app. You can see (somewhat complicated) instructions here:

I haven't done this personally, but this looks like it should work.

A: I do this with one copy of Dropbox. For my secondary account, I run an automator script on login that sets:
HOME=$HOME/Desktop/SECONDARY-DROPBOX /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &
I end up with two dropbox icons in the menu bar. I configure one to be alternate black/white icon so I can distinguish visibly between the two.

A: My (less complicated?) fix to this was...
I have two Mac accounts:
Robert, Corp a/c
Bob, Personal a/c
Dropbox installed on both Accounts synching to 
/Volumes/Working/Websync/Robert/Dropbox
/Volumes/Working/Websync/Bob/Dropbox

From a Terminal window in the Bob account
bob$>su Robert -c /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox

You'll be prompted for password for Robert
Dropbox will run something like
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python27.zip
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-darwin
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-mac
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-tk
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-old
/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload

Open a new terminal shell 'Cmd-T' and then run Dropbox for Bob
bob$> /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox

I'm running Dropbox v2.8.2 on Mountain Lion
Thanks to Mark for his answer to this Can I start an application as another user without actually switching users?

A: You can simply do that using multiple OS X accounts, running the same copy of Dropbox in each of them.
