Q: When will the iPad get threaded email messages? I use my iPhone and iPad to check emails, and would really like to have the threaded email functionality on my iPad the same as it is on my iPhone? Will this be available in iOS?

A: That's one of the features of iOS 4.2, which will be released in November.
