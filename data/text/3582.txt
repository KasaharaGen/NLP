Q: Ordering prints other than through iphoto I would like to order photo prints off of iphoto through phanfare because I like their quality of prints better than iphoto/kodak. Is there a way to do this?

A: Phanfare have an iPhoto plugin
http://www.phanfare.com/apps.aspx#Iphoto
So you can export to them directly from iPhoto.
