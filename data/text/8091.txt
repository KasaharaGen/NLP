Q: iBooks ePubs lost all cover art after iOS5 update After I upgraded to iOS 5 on my iPad 2, iBooks no longer shows any cover art for ePubs that I have imported. Anything that is from the iBook store shows art fine, along with PDFs.
Is there a solution to this?

A: Yes, I found that if you remove the books from the iPhone, then add them again via sync the cover art should return.

A: Try removing all iBooks form the iPad and the re-sync them again that fixes it.
