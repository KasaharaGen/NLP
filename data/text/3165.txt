Q: macbook pro 2011 13" doesn't detect external display I have a miniDP to VGA adapter, and its worked fine until this morning, I woke up and shook the mouse, but only the internal MacBook screen worked, not the external monitor. I tried to reset SMC and PRAM but it did not help. What might be wrong?
