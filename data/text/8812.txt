Q: LilyPond on Lion Did you succeed in installing LilyPond on Lion? How?
After downloading the (precompiled) LilyPond, I am getting:

In plain text:

LilyPond Error
An unexpected error has occurred during execution of the main script
ImportError:
dlopen(/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/objc/_objc.so,
2): Symbol not found: _objc_sync_notify
Referenced from:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/objc/_objc.so
Expected in: /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib

And yet I duly have:

ls -l /usr/lib/libobjc*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  1997152 21 Jul 01:27 /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       15 21 Jul 01:28 /usr/lib/libobjc.dylib -> libobjc.A.dylib


A: The problem is solved in the development version, download from LilyPond Development Page and use at own risk.
