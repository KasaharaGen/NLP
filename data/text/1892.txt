Q: View Image Full Screen On occasion I need to look at an image at fullscreen so it doesn't have anything else around it to distract me. Is there a way to do that? I can't seem to find a way to do it with preview.

A: You can use View -> Slideshow to do this in Preview

A: Additionally you can use QuickLook (spacebar) and click the FullScreen button :)

A: ⌥␣ in Finder opens QuickLook directly in full screen. There's also Sequential, a small app basically meant for viewing folders of images in full screen.

A: *

*Go to a folder with pictures

*Press Command + A to select all pictures

*Press Option + Space bar to view all images in full
screen

*Press Arrow keys to view next/previous picture

Note: Do NOT press Command + Backspace because It deletes all selected pictures!
