Q: MySQL Preference Pane control for MySQL installed via Homebrew I have installed MySQL via homebrew: brew install mysql. I'd like to get the MySQL preference pane hooked up to my installation of MySQL through homebrew. How can I achieve this?

A: See my answer to your question at superuser.com.

A: My understanding is that you can't get the MySQL Preference Pane via homebrew.  But if you download the 64-bit DMG file from MySQL's community server download page, it includes an installer, preference pane, and startup script.
