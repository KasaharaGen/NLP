Can I upgrade to Lion straight from 10.5.8? 

For us 10.5 users, is the only path a two step upgrade to 10.6 then 10.7?
Also, is there a hardware compatibility chart? My mac is an older macbook, not sure if it's even supported by Lion.

A: According to this page, you need to get on Snow Leopard before installing Lion.  It also gives hardware compatibility requirements, which are basically that you have an Intel Core 2 Duo (note: NOT Intel Core Duo), Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor in your Mac.

A: Please consider not only the technical but also the legal issues: Lion's license agreement requires that you own a valid license for Snow Leopard before installing Lion.
