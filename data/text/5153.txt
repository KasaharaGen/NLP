Q: Split bootable ISO I am a user of Windows and I want to use MAC OS X. I have an ISO image of MAC OS X but the size of an ISO image is more than 7 GB which is not writable on single DVD. I don't have dual-layer DVD writer. So tell me any solution to split the image in 2 parts. And after splitting  it can boot also. I mean to say that when first DVD have finished installation, system will ask for second DVD. Thanks in advance

A: Try putting the ISO image on a USB Drive. Or you could network boot it.
