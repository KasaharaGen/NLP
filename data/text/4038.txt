Q: Any REAL good Mac/iPhone combo IM applications out there? I am looking for a combo of two IM applications, one for the Mac and the other for the iPhone. The main features I am looking for are as follows:


*

*supports MSN (Microsoft messenger)

*has Push Notifications on the iPhone

*has a unified session (will explain below)

*doesn't have stupid bugs (Trillian will not let you copy with âŒ˜C)

*does not ask me to email someone that is invisible/offline (instead of messaging)


Unified session - I want the two apps (iOS and OSX) to share the same session, so when I leave the one and fire up the other, it should have my chats already there, exactly as I left them on the other device.
I have tried Meebo and Trillian thus far.
Meebo not being a Mac application did not feel right (not even when I applified it using Fluid) but its unified session (in the cloud) was pretty good. The iOS app was good.
Trillian is a great application on both iOS and OSX but has some stupidities built in (like the copy to clipboard bug I mentioned earlier).
What I'm actually looking for is something better than Trillian.
PS: since I'm a developer, open-source is a plus

A: I'm not sure about the unified session requirement - I've never seen that in any IM client.
However, I find Adium (http://adium.im/) is the best Mac IM application (and it's open source!).
As for the iPhone, have you considered IM+ (http://www.shapeservices.com)?  It works quite well for me.

A: You stated that you've looked at Meebo, and it has worked fairly well for me, though I've found IMO.im to work better for unified sessions. Again it's not a Mac app on the desktop, but you can pop-out the session and get a semblance of a native application.

A: Have you heard of SkyChat?
It's pretty awesome, and it works on both iPhone and Mac. I use it all the time!
Plus, as a developer, I know that the nuts and bolts in this open-source bad boy are up to scratch.
