Q: How can I gift an iPad app from iPhone OR via Web? I would like to gift an iPad app to my friend. I don't have iTunes installed on my work laptop and right now I don't have my iPad with me. 
All I am trying is checking it on App Store on my iPhone, but the search is not listing the iPad version, instead it's only showing iPhone version of the same app.
I also tried via browser, but no luck.
Do I have to wait until I go home and do it from either iTunes on my Mac or iPad? 
Looking for some solution!

A: At the moment, you have to use iTunes to gift an application for iPad.
If the application is universal, then you can gift the app with your iPhone.
