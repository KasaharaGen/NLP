Q: Is there a way to get the OSX battery icon to display both percentage and time? I am working on a 2006 MacBook with Snow Leopard. 
The battery level indicator has the option to show Time or Percentage remaining. I would like to show both.

Is there a way to enable this?
or
Can you recommend an app that will do it?

A: iStat Menu
offers to display both percentage and Time. http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/
When running SL, you could get the old free version. However, it does not contain the battery menulet: http://mac.brothersoft.com/istat-menus-2.0.html
