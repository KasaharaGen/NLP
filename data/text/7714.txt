Q: Where can I find drivers for Windows 7 on an iMac without Boot Camp Assistant? I have OS X installed on my 27" iMac and want to dual boot with Windows 7. I installed rEFit and then installed Windows 7. Now I need the drivers that normally get installed with Boot Camp Assistant. Does anybody know where to find them? I can't find them on Apple's site.

A: They are on one of the installation disks that comes with your iMac. Also, I'm pretty sure the drivers get installed if you download and run a "Bootcamp Software Update for Windows"  from Apple's support site. They are usually 200MB or up downloads that come packed with drivers for windows, so give it a try in case you can't find your cds.

A: They should be on the installer file for Windows that is linked on this Apple Support article. If your Windows is 64-bit, then check out this article. Hope this helps.
