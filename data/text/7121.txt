Q: Is users' discussion/chat on Jailbreaking allowed in an Apple-approved app? We have a 'web service' iPhone app where users can generate new content (which is publicly viewable) by uploading texts.
So, wanted to confirm: is it okay if they discuss/chat on benefits or on how to jailbreak?
Will the Apple take action once they find out? Or considering it to be user generated content, it will be ignored?
EDIT:
The app is not specifically meant for discussing Jailbreak. The app has many categories, including a "general chat" category, where it is being discussed by the users.

A: Unless Apple is hosting the user-generated content and the discussion of jailbreaking is in violation of the terms of use of that site, I don't see how Apple could take any action  against such a discussion.
There are certainly people using various Facebook, Twitter, and other public communication apps on their iPhones to discuss jailbreaking.
