Q: Can a Non-Thunderbolt device (like a mid 2010 iMac) connect to a Thunderbolt Display? I've been browsing different forums for this answer and the closest answer I could find was a post on this Stack Exchange. 
However this post is still a 'may be' it won't work and it targets the general question 'Non Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt ?' which I would understand to be negative.
My question is more on the display side, since the thunderbolt technology carries both a display signal as well a pci express signal, can a non-thunderbolt diplay with a simple display port still carry that signal to a thunderbolt cinema display ?
Thanks for your knowledge on that matter.

A: No, it cannot. That's the reason Apple is still selling the non-thunderbolt 27" display, for the devices like yours.
Source: Apple Online Store, where under system requirements it says:
System Requirements
Thunderbolt-enabled Mac computer, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac

A: You will find the requirements on the Apple website

System Requirements Thunderbolt-enabled Mac computer, including
  MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac OS X v10.6.8 or later

There is a good article here on the connectivity of the Thunderbolt displays that may help you understand
