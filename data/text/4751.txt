Q: Which Trans Music Manager equivalents exist for OS X? I have a Denon DP-200USB turntable that converts analogue records (LPs) into MP3s (one MP3 per side) and stores them onto a USB memory stick.
This lovely piece of kit comes with some software called Trans Music Manager (PDF) that will automatically split tracks (based on silence between tracks) followed by naming and tagging them using Gracenote. 
Sadly this software runs under Microsoft Windows, for which I don't have a licence.
Are there any solutions out there that can do this easily under Snow Leopard? Free and open-source software is preferred, but paid-for alternatives would be considered.

A: I haven't personally tried it, but AudioSlicer may be a good candidate

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI application
  for Mac OS X that finds all silences
  in an audio file and allows you to
  split it into several smaller audio
  files and to name/tag them properly.

Doesn't seem to do the Gracenote tag fetching, but you could use Jaikoz (tag from MusicBrainz db) or SimpleTagger (tag from Amazon db) for that.

A: Open in QuickTime Player and save as iPhone.
