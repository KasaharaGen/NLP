Q: How to recover an iPod Classic that won't turn on and doesn't appear as a drive? A friend of mine asked for help with an iPod Classic that isn't working.
It is an 80GB iPod Classic, model A1238, that doesn't give any signs of still being alive. It won't beep or light the screen, doesn't matters what I try.
I have tried to reset it (turn the hold switch on/off and then hold the middle and menu button) but it did nothing, and so I couldn't put it in disk mode either.
Right now I'm trying to charge it from a power adapter, but I don't expect it to help.
I had already tried to charge it from a PC, and from a MacBook Pro.
Anything else I could try, before sending it to repair?

A: Here's something that worked for me:


*

*Put the iPod into a ziploc bag and seal it tightly.

*Put it in the freezer overnight.

*Take it out in the morning.


I thought that it was just an urban myth, but as the iPod was apparently dead, why not try it? I was (pleasantly!) shocked to see it start up again the next morning.

A: Assuming that you've tried resetting while the iPod is connected to a power source, there's really not much else that can be done. The Apple Store, or an Authorized Apple Service Provider, is pretty much your only option at this point.
Also, how long has the iPod been doing this? If it was subject to extreme conditions for an extensive amount of time, or if it suffered liquid damage, it may be broken beyond repair (or repair may be cost-prohibitive, assuming it's no longer under warranty).
