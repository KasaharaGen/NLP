Q: Use SDK 10.5 in Xcode 4.1 on Lion I just upgraded my machine to Lion to see if the project works on the new OS, but I else need to support users using the program on machines running OS X 10.5, but Xcode 4.1 doesn't come with the 10.5 SDK, where can I get the SDK & how do I install it on my system?

A: That SDK isn't "supported" by Apple on that version of Xcode. You can still try Xcode 3.2.6 on Lion http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/xcode/305884-xcode-3-2-6-on-lion.html to avoid keeping around Snow Leopard for the "supported" version.

A: Download the disk image of xcode 3 (latest version) & found MacOSX10.5.pkg under packages & installed it in the Developer folder, it works great for the majority of stuff (had some problems with a C++ Library but managed to work around it)
