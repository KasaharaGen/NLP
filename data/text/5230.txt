Q: how to stop spotlight indexing an attached camera When I attach my video camera (for the purpose of importing some clips into FCP-X) I noticed that spotlight is indexing the camera (which does show up as an external disk when I connect it, via the USB cable)  I'm pretty sure that there is some contention between spotlight trying to index these files and FCPX trying to import them.  Is there a way to stop Spotlight from indexing the attached disk?

A: System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy  
Add your camera once and it should be remembered.
