Q: nvram -p... strange results I am having problems running the /usr/bin/purge commands on my iMac with Lion since the last upgrade. Someone suggested me that I may be running in safe mode and asked me to type "nvram -p" on terminal. According to this person, I should have any variable listed, but I have these:
efi-apple-recovery (an array)
fmm-computer-name
fmm-mobileme-token-FNM
EFICapsule_result
System AudioVolume
EFIBluetoothDelay

Each variable assigned to a bunch of stuff, specially the first and the third. Is this what I should see typing nvram -p on terminal?
thanks

A: If your NVRAM was set to boot into safe mode, you need a boot-args variable set to -x.


*

*Safe mode on: sudo nvram boot-args="-x"

*Safe + verbose mode on: sudo nvram boot-args="-x -v"

*Clear verbose and safe flags: sudo nvram boot-args=""
The details on these settings are straight from Apple Mac OS X: Starting up in Safe Mode.
