Q: Give iOS Developer Program membership as a gift? Is it possible to purchase a one-year iOS Developer Program membership for someone as a gift? I know the Apple ID of the desired recipient, but couldn't find how to offer the program membership.

A: No. Apple checks each developer's identity by checking with their credit card company, so it has to be paid with the developers credit card.
There are other ways involving faxing ID to them, but that's rather inconvenient.
