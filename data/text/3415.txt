Q: Boot mac with os select option everytime By holding down option key while booting I can select which OS I want to boot into. This is a bit hit and miss for me, sometimes the option key is not recognised and it just boots into my default OS.
Is there a way to boot into the OS select option everytime without pressing the option key ?
Thanks

A: You could install Refit,
which does the job for you.
