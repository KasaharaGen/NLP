Q: How do you access the user library on a time machine backup With Lion 10.7, how does one access the user library on a time machine backup through the Finder?

A: Go to the Finder. In the menu bar, select Go, then hold down Option. Select the "Library" option which appears.
Then enter Time Machine as per normal.

A: If you are accessing your Time Machine Backup with "Browse Other Backup Disks...", like you do if you created a fresh install of your OS, the solution from dan8394 does not work.
Probably because Time Machine can't know that your current Library folder is a newer version of the Library folder in the backup.
However, the solution proposed in a question that was closed as exact duplicate of this one works.
Lri helped me a lot with this answer:

The Library folder is probably just hidden by Finder. You can show all
hidden files by running this in Terminal:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true && osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"'

(Note: The part after the && will cause finder to stop, and you may need to restart it. So be aware that any open Finder windows may disappear.)
Changing true to false reverts the setting.
