Q: How can I implement AirPrint using any mac-served printer using this "DNS-SD" configuration? AirPrint is a function on iOS that allows you to print from your iPad (or whatever) to certain wireless printers.  Sadly, there are only a dozen or so compatible printers.
However, on the article on AirPrint on Wikipedia, the article states that it is possible to make the feature work with ANY printer that is connected to your mac. Specifically, the text says:
"For other printers, AirPrint support can be added to an existing CUPS Server with DNS based Service Discovery, by manually adding DNS-SD printer service discovery records to a name server.[7]" 
The footnote takes a person to a very techie article about DNS stuff:  http://www.dns-sd.org/ServerStaticSetup.html ... but it is not written in a way an average power user could understand.
My question: What is an only-moderately-techie set of instructions that will tell me how to configure this, using this method, so that I can have my iPad print wirelessly to an HP P1102w printer that is connected (via wifi, in fact) to my mac?

A: I know this isn't directly what you asked for, but if you are looking for a non-techie approach to sharing printers via Airprint, you could do far worse than to use Printopia.  It's not free, but it isn't expensive and it works very well indeed.

A: It's not "non" techie, but there's a more detailed explanation at

(I intend to try this, but have not yet...)
