Q: Not able to view video in Safari I am trying to view a video in safari and it says there is a plugin missing. The message I get is:
This page has content that requires an Internet plug-in.
This page contains content of “application/x-vlc-plugin” type. You do not have the plug-in required to view this content.

I cannot view this video on Chrome as well.
Please let me know what I can do to resolve this.

A: My guess is that you need the VLC plugin, available on VLC download page.
