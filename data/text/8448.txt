Q: Mac renames itself automatically - host name is incorrect in terminal I've got a handleful of macs (all with unique names) and on occasion it prompt a notice about saying another computer on the network as this name and adds a (2) or (3) to my mac.  
How can I set the host name from the command line?

A: Yes you can :
sudo scutil --set HostName "YourHostName"
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "YourLocalHostName"

to change the computer name : 
sudo scutil --set ComputerName "YourComputerName"

To check if everything is okay : sudo scutil --get HostName

A: There is a couple ways to go about solving this problem.
The immediate change is to to open up Terminal, and issue the command

sudo scutil --set HostName {your machine name here}

The next thing to do is to 

sudo pico /etc/hostconfig 

Add the following line, followed by Ctrl+O, and then Ctrl+X

HOSTNAME={your machine name here}

Finally reboot
