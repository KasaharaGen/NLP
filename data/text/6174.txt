Q: MS Office always slower on Mac? I have been using Microsoft Office Mac since the 2004 version. Right now, I have Office 2011 running on my trusty 2010 MacBook Pro with a Core i7 2.66 gHz CPU and 8 GB of memory.
Starting with Mac Office 2004, I noticed that it is always slower than its Windows counterparts. For instance, Word opens in a few seconds on a Windows system, but takes ~10 seconds on a Mac.
Is this generally true for everyone? Or is it just a fluke that Office has always been very slow for me on a Mac?

A: Since the Windows version pre-loads some of the apps at boot time, here's how to do a comparison. 


*

*Start with your Mac turned off.

*Press the power button and start your timer.

*Wait for the Mac to boot, then open Word. When Word is open, stop your timer.

*Then repeat the test for a Windows PC, starting with the PC turned off.


Also note that Office 2004 was written for PowerPC chips, but you're running it on an Intel Mac. That slows things down because Intel Macs have to translate all that PowerPC code into Intel code. If you upgrade to Office 2008 or 2011, you'll have an Intel version of Office for Mac, and it should run faster.

A: You shouldn't be very surprised since Microsoft depends on office's reputation as a selling point of windows. Why would they make it just as good on the mac? If you want speed I highly suggest you give iWork a shot

A: Office 2004 for Mac was Microsoft's 1st attempt to get their products across to the Macintosh. To have all the features from Windows still working for the Mac (I guess) they had to work around some issues, especially since Apple was using PowerPC processors, they had to ensure compatibility with those as well, making their 1st product a rather slow one.
Now though Office 2011 for Mac and Office 2010 for Windows (which are literally the same but for different OS) starts as quickly on Mac OS X Lion as it on Windows 7.
