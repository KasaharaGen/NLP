Q: iPhone missing task manager I've updated my iPhone 3G to the latest version (4.1 8B117), but I'm still missing features such as the task manager, background wallpaper, etc. I've tried restoring it a couple times now, even set it up as a brand new phone, but I'm still missing these features. Can anyone shed some light on why this is?

A: The features you mentioned, "task manager & background wallpaper" are not available on the iPhone 3G.  In order to have access to all the features of iOS 4 you need to have it installed on an iPhone 3GS or later.
