Q: Are the LaunchPad icons bigger/magnified in Mac OS 10.7.2? Just upgraded to 10.7.2 and found out that the Launchpad icons had become much bigger / magnified. 
Is this a normal thing or is there something wrong with my installation?

A: *

*Yes, they are bigger.

*No, the size is hardcoded in the actual application.
