Q: Xcode and python and java I just installed Xcode 4. Everything seemed fine, but then, after poking around, I found that the ability to create Python and Java (And probably more) projects was missing. I asked Apple in apple store chat (on their web site) and was told that Python and Java are supported. However, I can't find where to make a Python or Java project - only C based files (and some more miscellaneous files). Does anyone know how to make Java/Python based files/projects?

A: I think Xcode 4 does not support Java or python so I would be interested in seeing what the chat said. OSX does support both.
Xcode was never a very good IDE for java or python so I would always try to use something else (except if using PyObjc)
Look on Stack Overflow for suggestions of IDEs
IntelliJ/PyCharm and Eclipse work on OSX as do several others

A: TextMate is a good editor for Ruby and Python. Tons of bundle's can be added to make it fit your needs.

A: Nothing has changed with Python support; just drop into the terminal:
$ python —version
Python 2.7.1
You can use Xcode’s editor to make .py files, etc.
Check out Quick Python/Developer tips for OSX Lion for more details.
Regarding Java, it’s not part of Lion, but that’s easy to fix—download the runtime for Java SE 6 version 1.6.0_26 from Apple so you can run the programs you’ll be writing and possibly an IDE (like Eclipse) that requires it.

A: I have not tried Python in XCode, but I have successfully built Java projects with XCode 3. When I updated XCode to 3.2, they dropped the Java Templates. I just used Time Machine to get the templates back and added them to ~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Project Templates/Java and now I have my templates and it still compiles. I can't confirm if this works in XCode 4 but you can give it a try. I uploaded the templates if you don't have them and need to download.
