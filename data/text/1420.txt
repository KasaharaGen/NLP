Q: Does iOS 4.2 change the voltage on the camera kit USB? I want to use my happy hacking keyboard with ipad.
I just read an aritlce about changes on ios 4.2. One of changes I noticed was that voltage changes for camera kit on ios 4.2. I also read that USB keyboards no longer works with camera kit on ios 4.2.
Is that true?

A: I could have sworn I've managed to use a USB keyboard with my iPad, and it shipped to me with 4.2.1 installed. Maybe my keyboard uses less voltage (it's one of those semi-novelty foldable ones).
Perhaps you could get around this limitation with a powered USB hub?
Update: I've recently heard rumour of someone working on a solution for this.

A: Yes it is true, I just connected my USB Key Board using Camera connection adapter, and it shows "Accessory unavailable, The attached accessory uses too much power".
iPad Software Version: 4.2
