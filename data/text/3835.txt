Q: Issues with document syncing between iOS and host computer I had an app in my iphone which i recorded a meeting, (TSA) it said it was ready to sync to document folder. so I syncd and they all disappeared.
Where is the document folder located?
When itunes deletes from iphone is there any way to find those and restore?
Why did itunes delete apps that were installed?

A: Did you sync with a computer that you don't usually use? If you lost the app, you lost it's Documents directory, and your recording is gone.
Here's what is supposed to happen;
You're supposed to open iTunes and browse to your device. In the list of apps with the iOS Home Screen style view, there is a section at the bottom to select an Application, and manage it's Documents storage folder.
You do not need to sync in order to view up-to-date information in this screen. You are immediately able to save the data out of the app into a location on your computer.
Unfortunately, if you've sync'ed your phone and lost the app you've also lost the data from within it. There is little likelihood for data recovery on a Flash Disk device.
