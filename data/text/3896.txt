Q: Does the 2011 iMac have SATA 3 support? I'm excited about the iMac 2011 refresh, but I'm troubled by the news that there are no SATA 3 connections. There's lots of confusion on Mac Rumors and OWC blogged that there is no SATA 3.
I was wondering if anyone has an iMac 2011 and can confirm that there is in fact no SATA 3 controller. I'm trying to determine if I should get a Vertex 3 or just stick with the Vertex 2. No SATA 3 controller would mean you wouldn't get any benefit from the Vertex 3. Thanks in advance.

A: It turns out that there is SATA 3 on board, it just wasn't enabled until 4 May 2011. The Other World Computing blog has the details:

While iMac EFI Update 1.6 is described
  as including “fixes that improve
  performance and stability for
  Thunderbolt,” it would also seem that
  an unadvertised benefit is that it
  also unlocks the full 6Gb/s, SATA 3.0
  capabilities of two of the internal
  drive bays.
Unfortunately, the optical bay remains
  at 3Gb/s.


A: I don't have a 2011 iMac, however you can trust the statement from OWC that you linked in your question.  
They bought one, took it apart and unequivocally state that there is NO SATA 3 support.
Since they sell the Vertex 3 and the industry is moving towards SATA 3, it would not be in their commercial interest to make this statement were it not true.

A: Whilst there may be no SATA3 controller on board there is nothing to stop a SATA3 to Thunderbolt interface appearing in the future.
The lack of SATA3 on the new iMacs is not stopping me from buying one. Thunderbolt will provide all the expansion opportunities I need.
