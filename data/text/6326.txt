Q: How do I make an AppleScript with a drop-down menu without Xcode? How do I make an AppleScript that displays a drop-down menu without using Xcode?

A: One option would be to use CocoaDialog**:
set l to {"aa", "bb", "cc"}
set choices to ""
repeat with x in l
    set choices to choices & quoted form of x & " "
end repeat
set dialog to paragraphs of (do shell script "/Applications/CocoaDialog.app/Contents/MacOS/CocoaDialog" & " standard-dropdown --title title --text text --items " & choices)
if item 1 of dialog is "2" then return -- pressed cancel button
item ((item 2 of dialog) + 1) of l


You could also just use choose from list:
choose from list {"aa", "bb", "cc"} with title "Title" with prompt "Please choose" default items "bb" with multiple selections allowed

A: There is no built in concept of a menu in the dialogs-alerts within the AppleScript language. 
The closest you could do would be to name some dummy files (in a temporary folder) with the appropriate action and have the user choose the file labeled with the action you wanted to perform.
open folder blah
  with selected file bah
    do whatever

A horrendous "solution" to a problem that needs a cocoa menu - whether you make it in Xcode or someone else does - Xcode/IB is the tool that creates a menu. MacRuby is a nice way to script an app that needs a more full featured UI than AppleScript. You don't need Xcode/IB to ruby up an app from pure script.
You could create a NIB using Interface Builder and script it all using AppleScript, but the nib defines the menu itself - not AppleScript (even if AppleScript can populate or delete the menu items at run time).

A: Additionally, if you just need a list to choose from, you could also do 
choose from list listYouDefined with prompt "Choose from the list." 
Google "AppleScript Choose from list".

A: I understand this is an old question but since the best up-voted answer says in the documentation for CocoaDialog 2:

Downloads do not work Downloads for cocoadialog 2 are no longer
  available. This is mostly in part due to the various changes and lack
  of permanent storage over the years.

and 3 isn't coming till Spring/Summer 18 I was searching for other alternatives and I found Pashua:

(pic taken from the site)
Under the documentation this is called a popup:
Example: Using popup
p.type = popup
p.label = Example popup menu
p.width = 310
p.option = Popup menu item #1
p.option = Popup menu item #2
p.option = Popup menu item #3
p.default = Popup menu item #2

After using it I found you can install the Pashua.app in your Application directory or you can embed Pashua in your app.  I'm not the author of this but I needed a base solution for a GUI and this wasn't mentioned. 

A: You don't need Xcode for AppleScript. Just open the AppleScript Editor in Applications/Utilities (Finder shortcut for the Utilities folder: âŒ˜ Command+Shift+U). There is some sample code for dropdown menus on MacScripter: Dropdown menu.
