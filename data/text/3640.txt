Q: Is AppleTV the only device that can receive AirPlay VIDEO? 3rd-party AirPlay-enabled AV-receivers are starting to hit the market (Pioneer, Denon, Marantz), but as far as I can tell, they can stream AirPlay audio only.
Apple's page for AirPlay seems to imply the same thing. The only Apple pages that mention video streaming are the AppleTV page and the iOS 4.3 Update page, which don't make any mention of 3rd-party products.
This question mentions that other iOS devices and Macs can be enabled to receive AirPlay video streams through 3rd-party apps.
So are there any existing (or announced) 3rd-party hardware products that can do so? I'm particularly interested in AV receivers as I plan my next home theater upgrade.

A: Didn't intend to answer my own question, but I found this March 2011 Bloomberg article:

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is weighing an
  expansion of its AirPlay audio service
  to include streaming video from an
  iPhone or iPad to television sets,
  according to two people familiar with
  the project.
Under the plan, Apple would license
  its AirPlay software to
  consumer-electronics makers that could
  use it in devices for streaming
  movies, TV shows and other video
  content, said the people, who asked to
  remain anonymous because the plans
  havenâ€™t been made public. Apple now
  only licenses AirPlay for streaming
  audio. Devices that could be used for
  video may be available this year, one
  of the people said.

So apparently the answer is "not yet, but maybe in the future."

A: XBMC can also act as an Airplay video receiver so that'll add practically any computer to the list, but as far as I know, they've reverse engineered the protocol, so there are no guarantees it'll continue to work.

A: Boxee Box works with AirPlay. You can install Boxee software on many hardware platforms so if the native software can't play Airplay you can always try to change it to Boxee. 

A: You can Airplay to Amazon Fire, Windows, Mac, or Android devices using Reflector 2. It claims to support sending from iOS 9 devices also (note I personally haven't tested the iOS 9 support yet).
Reflector installs an app that acts as an AirPlay and Google Cast receiver. The app is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or Amazon Fire. Since Reflector supports receiving both AirPlay and Google Cast it can receive audio/video from iOS or Android.
It's from Squirrels, the same company that makes the excellent AirParrot app (which allows you send AirPlay audio and video from Windows and Mac to AirPlay and Google Cast).

A: These days, many TVs (such as from Samsung and LG) and Roku boxes can receive AirPlay video. I believe they also support HomeKit.
