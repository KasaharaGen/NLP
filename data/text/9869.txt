A: As per the Lion technical specifications, there must be at least 2GB of RAM. Do u have ?
If yes, then there may be some other unnecessary applications using the resources of OS. These must be either stopped or removed from your Mac.
To keep your Mac clean and remove unnecessary data, you can use Stellar Speed Up Mac software.
Please make sure you have enough free space in your disk.
