Q: Did they increase RAM in iPad 2? Since there was no hint about more RAM during the presentation yesterday, did anyone find out if they stay with 256 or (like iPhone 4) increased it at least up to 512?

A: Apple never releases information about memory. The current rumour is 512 MB. You should wait until some opens it up (e.g. iFixit).
And there you go . iPad-2-Wi-Fi-Teardown. 512 MB of Samsung manufactured RAM.


A: You know, I know how much RAM is in the devices I choose as well. I used to be such a predictor of how well a device functions, but I have to admit that Apple's latest round of iOS devices make me not really care anymore. Why worry about when it functions so smoothly. I for one hope more hardware manufacturer's adopt this philosophy, "Make it work well as an integrated device, not as a combination of desperate gadets".
