Q: KeePass 2.17 fails to start I installed the newest Mono framework on Lion. After that I tried installing KeePass 2.17 from http://keepass2.openix.be/. When I try to start the application it probably fails, silently (it looks as if nothing happened). How can I check what happened?
Does anybody know how to use KeePass 2.x on MacOS Lion?

A: I found the problem and have a workaround until the developer publishes a fix.


*

*In your Applications folder, right click on the app and choose Show Package Contents.

*Navigate to the Contents/MacOS folder and open startkeepass.sh in TextEdit.
Change this line:
path="/Applications/KeePass2.16.app/Contents/MacOS"
to this:
path="/Applications/KeePass2.17.app/Contents/MacOS"
(Replace the 6 with a 7).

*Save and close.
Now the application should start up.

A: I resolved my issues by using KeepassX (version 2.0 alpha 4), which appears to have less functions, but is natively integrated in OsX and copy-and-paste works as expected.
