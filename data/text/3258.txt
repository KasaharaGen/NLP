Q: Subtle light-colored horizontal lines across Macbook screen, and jaw-dropping calibration behavior My issue:
When viewing solid, light tones, such as #FDF6E3, I see evenly spaced horizontal lines across my entire screen (I have a 2010 white Macbook).
These lines are especially visible when the screen is viewed from below, or when the screen is tilted back.
My attempted fix:
I decided to try to calibrate the colors on my screen (System Preferences -> Display -> Color -> Calibrate). I did not check the "Expert Mode" checkbox.
The first option presented to me is Gamma: I can select between:


*

*Gamma 2.2 (Standard)

*Gamma 1.8


Regardless of the original value, if I simply change the gamma selection, the lines go away! Yippee!!
So, I keep clicking "Continue", ignoring the other options, until I am asked to enter a name for my new color profile. I enter a name, and then the moment I click  "Continue", the lines return, and I'm told that new profile has been applied. Darn it.
Sure enough, if I change other settings, those settings do stick. So this isn't a matter of the color profile not getting applied.
Question:
Has anyone experienced a similar issue? Why are the lines going away during the calibration process, but are immediately returning as soon as the new profile is applied? What should I do?
