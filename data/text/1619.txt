Q: Migrations Assistant - Best way to transfer data? I'm thinking of using Migration Assistant to transfer data to my new Mac, but what is the best way to do this?
I have a Time Machine Back up on a Time Capsule, but this would be over wifi, so slow?
I guess target disk mode is out, as my MacBook only has FW400 and the iMac only has FW800, I understand these are different connectors, so out of the question?
However I do have a FW drive with both FW400 & FW800 connectors, so could Time Machine onto that, would it be slow?
Or could I make a temporary wired network between the two machines? If so would I need a crossover cable, or are Macs clever enough for this to work with a standard ethernet cable?

A: I have a FW800-FW800 cable that comes with an adaptor, and will convert FW800 to FW400.  So I can put on the adaptor and use TDM between a FW800 and FW400 machines.  Macs have ethernet interfaces that do auto MDI-X, so a crossover cable is not necessary.  Plug and play.
