Q: Can I download a free app from the App Store without a credit card? I just recently got an iPod Touch and wanted to download some free apps. The App Store wanted me to get an Apple ID, no problem. But now it's telling me to input a credit card. I don't have one, and anyway shouldn't need one to download free apps. 
I did some searching here and on Google and found out that there should be a "None" option when selecting credit cards, but it was not there. I then read that it's disabled in some countried, so I tried telling iTunes that I'm in the US (I'm in Argentina), but still no "None" option. Later, I read that apparently this feature was disabled in iTunes 10, so I installed iTunes 9, but I still don't get the option.
How can I get the No Credit Card option to appear when downloading an app for the first time? It doesn't make sense that you should need a credit card for free stuff.
EDIT: To clarify, I already made an account in Apple's website, I'm looking for a way to be able to select "None" when buying an app through iTunes.

A: To get an app for free (if you didn't get the choice to pick None as payment option) you should open your installed ITunes program. Then from within the program go to ITunes Store and pick any free app and try to buy it (Google Translate or some other one). It will tell you to login/register into ITunes. If you create account from there you will have a choice to pick None as payment option.
This worked for me several times for my customers.

A: Buy an Apple iTunes Gift Card for $10 and redeem it in your iTunes account. That should satisfy their internal logic and allow you to download free items (and obviously buy items if you wanted to). After I my account was hacked from China (long story, don't ask), I removed my credit card and added some money via an iTunes gift card so if it got hacked again, they couldn't buy an excessive amount of content.
