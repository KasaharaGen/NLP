Q: Educational discount policy at Apple and international student I would like to know the discount amount available for educational at Apple stores and how does this apply cross-country.
Is the educational discount valid for refurbished products?
For example, if you are a student in a country where Apple does not have a store, can you get a discount and how?

A: If you select the Online Apple Store for your Country, and then at the bottom of the page click on the "Education Store" link - you'll see which options you have.
Some Institutions/Schools/Educations will give you a discount without any documentation - other requires a special log-in to the Apple Store (where you typically get a better discount).
All the above for the online Apple Store - if you can get a discount in a "real" Apple Store in a Country where you don't live, I don't know for sure - but I do know that it is possible in some places of the world, if you just show some School ID.
